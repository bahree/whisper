00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,080
All right, everyone. I am here with Jack Berkowitz. Jack is the chief data officer with ADP. Jack,

2
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,840
welcome to the Twimal AI podcast. Thanks. Thanks for having me. I'm looking forward to digging into

3
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,680
our conversation. We'll be talking about some of the ways that ADP is using machine learning,

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,680
but to get us started, I'd love to have you share a little bit about your background and a little

5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,440
bit about your career. Sure. I've got a long career been at this for 30, 31 years now.

6
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:47,120
Kind of three phases. First phase was largely doing work with DARPA. So early 90s, mid 90s,

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,880
doing a lot of work and at that time it was cutting edge, things like ontologies,

8
00:00:52,880 --> 00:01:00,160
distributed reasoning technology. All sorts of stuff that people at DARPA would normally

9
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,480
equate. Then I spent about 12 years doing various startups, some in the semantic web, some in search,

10
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:14,080
some in analytics. And then for the past 10 years, split between Oracle and now ADP, really running

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,360
large scale enterprise level analytics products. And so we build products for other people.

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,920
And then my job at ADP is a combination of building products for clients. And then also doing

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,120
some things internally that ADP uses. Awesome. Awesome. And when you started at ADP, you started out

14
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:40,960
in a product-centric role and transitioned over to CDO. I'd love to have you share a little bit

15
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:48,160
about that transition, how it came about, and how you, it sounds like you still retain some

16
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,280
product ownership there. Yeah, sure do. So the CDO role really has two faces to it.

17
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,680
On the one hand, we build product for clients. We have tens of thousands of clients that use

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:07,920
our analytics for HR, people analytics, compensation analytics, recruiting, things like that.

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,800
And then we also have a defensive nature to the CDO organization. So besides having all the data

20
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,800
advantage, what do we do to protect the information? And one of the big messages that I spend a lot

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,880
of time on is talking about data governance. So it's pretty funny because as product development,

22
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,800
people as machine learning people, we hear the word data governance and we immediately think,

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,480
okay, people are trying to get in our way. We're trying to hold us back. And actually what it means to

24
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,880
us is it enables us to get the data into a nice, clean way so that we can share. And so that,

25
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,880
you know, somebody builds a NML algorithm to do something. I don't know what, you know, but

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,560
for job matching, the entire community of developers can then use that algorithm for job matching,

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,200
right? So that's all part of that governance that we're putting in place today.

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,440
So I'd love to come back to that data governance topic. Before we do, I've jumped right in and

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,960
maybe taking it for granted that folks know who ADP is. And it may be the case that most do, but

30
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:17,920
why don't you give us a quick summary of ADP and the company's focus? Yeah. So ADP is the world's

31
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:26,240
largest provider of HR payroll benefit solutions. So we have over 920,000 clients in 140 countries.

32
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:34,160
And, you know, most people know ADP because their W2 or their paycheck has been issued by ADP.

33
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:39,200
Maybe not today, but maybe at some point in their career. And if it hasn't, it will be, right?

34
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,160
One of the things that we talk a lot about ADP is it's not your grandfather's ADP, but it's

35
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:50,000
actually my grandfather's ADP. So they've been around for about 70 years. He had a small gas station.

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,560
The update is employees and the family through ADP. But, you know, a series of firsts of the

37
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,600
company, really the first companies ever use computers for payroll. First company to build a,

38
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,440
what we now call self-doors of service used to be called something else in the late 90s for doing

39
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:16,880
HR. First company to do mobile apps for the employees of companies. And so every day, you know,

40
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,120
every week you can check your payroll, you can clock in and out, you can, you know, check your 401K

41
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:30,160
balance through the through your mobile app. So lots of people, about 58,000 people today,

42
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,000
building products, and then providing great expertise. Because the one thing about HR is that

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,360
it's not just about the software. You know, there's, you know, regulations that have to be maintained,

44
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,560
there's problems for, for employees or clients that need to be solved, you know, what if I'm

45
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,560
adopting cross-order? What's the impact on my pay or, or any sort of things like that? And so,

46
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,040
you know, our CEO likes to say, hey, it's about building great products with great expertise.

47
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,920
And that's really what we try to bring to bear. I think one of the consequences of that long history

48
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:13,040
is, you know, the companies associated with some of those early technologies that maybe weren't

49
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:19,280
so early when it first got started, you know, to be very clear when I think of kind of poster

50
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,560
trials for the mainframe. ADP is one of those companies who comes to mind and yet we're connected

51
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,320
because you were delivering a keynote at AWS re-invent, talking about some of the things the

52
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,320
companies doing with machine learning as part of the data cloud product. Talk a little bit about

53
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,800
what it means to be building cutting edge data-centric product in a company with that kind of history

54
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,680
and legacy. Yeah, so we still have a little bit of those mainframes running around. And guess what?

55
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:58,640
So does every bank and every, you know, DMV and everything else. And it's funny, right? As somebody

56
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,320
who's always on the cutting edge, you heard like DARPA and cloud and everything, you know, what do

57
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,880
you mean? Well, the data's got to come from somewhere, right? And if you want reliability,

58
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,480
tell us, it doesn't actually matter where the data comes from. What we're able to do is harness

59
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,840
the semantics of it, the meanings of it, bring it together and make it available in a platform

60
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,200
in something that other people can use, blows and our own teams can use. And that's the essential part

61
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:32,080
of it. And so, you know, when we were looking, how do we do that in a modern way and how do we

62
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,040
keep up with the pace of business? And, you know, the pace of business is just unbelievable,

63
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:44,000
particularly now since COVID hit, you know, for us moving it into the cloud made total sense,

64
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,880
right? And so we're sinking information every single minute back and forth between, you know,

65
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,840
those classic on-prem data centers, but their data centers, just the same way as any other data

66
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:02,880
center. It's not like it's running under my desk or something. And we're sinking information,

67
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,760
and we're extracting value out of it by taking advantage of all the services that we can get

68
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:14,880
in the AWS cloud. You're coming about platforms, ties back to the the common and about governance,

69
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,280
and what brings them together is this idea of making it easier for your teams to be productive

70
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,800
with that data, to pull meaning out of it, make predictions with that kind of thing. Can you

71
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:35,280
talk a little bit about the challenges with harnessing the data that the organization has at its

72
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,160
scale? Yeah, let me give you a great example. I'll give you two different examples. Let me start

73
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,120
with one though that it really summarizes not just harnessing the meaning, but also, you know,

74
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,520
the amount of machine learning we're building, right? So in any given month, we pay about 30 million

75
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:59,600
people in the US. And for those 31 million, 30 million people, we've got about 21 million job

76
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:05,440
titles. Okay? So, yeah, for about eight or, you know, for about nine million, we don't know what they

77
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,360
do for a living, but for 21 million, we do. We need to crunch that data down into some common

78
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:19,120
job titles. In fact, we crunch it down to about 9,000 job titles. Now, we don't do that manually.

79
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,400
We don't do that with rules, right? And so we run all that in a data driven machine learning pipeline

80
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,520
using some pretty advanced technology to get that done. All the latest buzzwords you can imagine

81
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,560
plus a few are involved in that pipeline. And you say, well, why do that? Well, if I want to know

82
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,640
what a software engineer makes, you would think that would be easy, but company A calls it software

83
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:52,960
engineer three company B calls it, I don't know, development specialist company C calls it, you know,

84
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:59,920
creative machine learning guru juggler, right? And we've got to have a way to bring all that in from

85
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,640
art. Yeah, you can only imagine everybody gets to invent their own title, right? And we've got to

86
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,200
have a way to bring that together. And we do that for our compensation benchmarks. We do that and we

87
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:15,200
use that same exact thing in sort of our recruiting and sourcing systems. We do the same thing in our

88
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:21,360
performance review systems. And that's a great example of the challenge. And then we have the same

89
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:27,040
exact challenge when we try to provide the capabilities for companies to operate in multiple countries.

90
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,160
So things that may be obvious in the US like holiday or vacation are called different things in

91
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,320
different countries. And in fact, the math and the calculation law was different depending on

92
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,920
the country you're in. And so we have the ability by bringing all that information together, having

93
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:52,480
you know, models on top to combine that information so that our clients benefit through all this

94
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,440
processing. And so when you talk about data governance, are you thinking about it akin to kind

95
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,720
of a traditional enterprise architecture, big committees deciding who can do what and where

96
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,440
data sits and that kind of thing? You know, I'd like to say that there are no committees and we're

97
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:19,280
we're a reflection of the distributed internet. It's not quite there. But so we do have a central

98
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:24,960
group, but we really try to operate in more of a hub and spoke or a federated way. And in in

99
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,160
that sense, you know, a lot of people are talking about data mesh these days. We think about

100
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:38,320
as a semantic mesh or a metrics mesh. So we want the teams that are responsible to operate on and

101
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,680
have the domain knowledge. There's a central group, right, that makes sure that things can attach

102
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:50,400
because otherwise it's just pandemonium, right? So there's a central group that ensures that either

103
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:56,720
it's a concept, right, a domain object or a or a new metric that it can attach to some parent

104
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,600
object. But in that case, you know, the central team's very thin and the amount of work they do

105
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,520
is very thin. It's really distributed. We have, you know, tens of not tens, but hundreds and hundreds

106
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:16,800
of people in development. And we want them to have the independence to be able to create in a way

107
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:25,760
that they can do best. Now related to that is also then the data lineage. So it doesn't

108
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,600
know good for somebody say, Hey, I've got the data source of data sources for, you know, some problem

109
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:38,560
benefits. If they don't provide how that data has been brought together and then managed and

110
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,760
then brought up. So we also have artifacts that, you know, if you're going to participate in that

111
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,480
in that world of this federation or this, this combination of information, well, then you also

112
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,240
have the responsibility to say, Hey, this is where my data came from. I'm going to take care of

113
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:01,680
the data quality of it. And I'm going to advertise to all my other people that collaborate in that

114
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,600
sense. So, you know, I said, Hey, when you were asking me about my career, I started and I did a

115
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,840
lot of work in the semantic web. We actually bring a lot of those concepts to bear. Now whether or

116
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,040
not it's the formal semantics and the language, I don't know, but that idea of distributed data,

117
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:23,120
self-describing data and then attachment of data is something that we try to bring to bear across

118
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:34,720
our company. And the ultimate objective is to allow teams to move more quickly. Yeah, I mean,

119
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,680
I think, I think it's three, three key things to us. The first one is about pace, right?

120
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,760
Or client, the world's busy. Clients are demanding and the world's situations are changing all the

121
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,560
time, right? Second thing is, is, is, is about reliability. Because we're messing with people's

122
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,560
paychecks. At the end of the day, that's what we do. And, and, you know, that's the most personal

123
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,440
data there is other than maybe healthcare data, right? If you want to, if you want to see

124
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,840
somebody get excited, make a mistake on their paycheck, right? And so we, we have to have a little

125
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,160
bit of reliability in terms of what we're doing. So the first thing's about pace, second thing's

126
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,520
about reliability. And the third thing is really about clarity and explainability, whether it's

127
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:25,360
to each other inside the development teams or whether it's to our, and clients, right? This is why,

128
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,600
you know, so there's like an explainability and ethics overlay to all of this as to why we're

129
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,760
so into this, the data governance approach. You gave us a couple of specific examples of

130
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:44,160
machine learning use cases there. Be curious, have you talked broadly about the various ways

131
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:52,800
that ML has used? And my guess is that it's used primarily in kind of new products that are built

132
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,120
on top of the data assets that the company has, as opposed to kind of that core payroll processing

133
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,400
or other use cases there as well. You'd be surprised. Yeah, no, you'd be surprised. And so we have

134
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:12,080
machine learning throughout the entire corporation at this point. And it's come on really fast.

135
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,800
It's come on fast because we've separated the data, but we've also exposed all the machine learning

136
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:24,560
processes through microservices or through APIs. And then that allows, yes, totally, brand new products,

137
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,400
they're intelligent from the ground up, they're everything everybody could imagine. You know,

138
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:36,720
there's a chatbot for the screen changes. But we also use it to do things on the older products

139
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:44,960
as almost overlays into them, right? So the ability to check a payroll before it's submitted and

140
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:51,440
all the money goes, the ability to check for anomalies, that's all based on new machine learning

141
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,640
capabilities because now we have the data in one place. We can do that and we can provide new

142
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,680
capabilities to existing what we're thought of as legacy applications. And so you can make

143
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:08,400
something fresh for our clients at the same time as building net new products all at the same time.

144
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:16,880
And so we're getting great reception on sort of that innovation aspect with our clients because

145
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,600
we've taken some pretty hard steps in terms of building a data platform and building up machine

146
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,600
learning. But it really is to have benefit to them. Let's dig into that platform that you've

147
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,840
built a little bit. Is that the data cloud? Yeah, so the data cloud is really this collection of

148
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:37,360
capabilities, right? Some people identify as the products we build and some identify as this

149
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:45,440
platform of data. It's built on top of a set of those capabilities, whether it's Amazon EMR

150
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:56,000
or Amazon SageMaker and S3s at the bottom of it. We have some partners in as well, some of the

151
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,400
key partners in in the data space because there's certain things dealing with, for example, data

152
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:08,320
security that still is an emerging area of technology. And so we'll bring in partners as need be.

153
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,120
We don't want to constrain people as well. So if they've built models using, for example,

154
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:22,000
libraries like BERT or GPT-3, they have access to be able to do and use those models as well.

155
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:30,400
We want to govern those use of third-party systems because we don't want any hacker to infiltrate

156
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,760
our supply chain of ML, if you will. But all of it's there and all of it's available.

157
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:44,800
We have a sort of a standard way. Either data scientists or data engineers can enter and interact

158
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,040
with the platform. Security is all managed and so they have access to certain data assets. There

159
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:57,600
may be other data assets that they need to request and get permission to use. Things that get very

160
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,960
personal about people, for example. And then everything included in there is everything's obfuscated

161
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:11,280
and encrypted. And so if there are data elements that you don't have a need to know, as a

162
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,920
data scientist, you don't need to know. But we'll obfuscate it, but the engine can still perform

163
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:23,200
actions against it. And so that's a big aspect of the platform is to make sure that

164
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,800
to reduce the amount of data duplication, but also maintain control of some very personal data

165
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:39,520
that people have. Did the platform start out as kind of abstracting things that you built for

166
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,840
a specific product into a generalized capability or did it start as a larger effort that pulled in

167
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,920
various internal and external things? What's the history? Yeah, now in my experience boiling the

168
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:57,040
ocean up front to build a platform just leaves you with a bunch of steam and some salt in the

169
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:02,800
bottom of a container. And then you're just like, well, where did it go? It's like you got this,

170
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:10,000
well, you got to, you don't have any wrinkles in your shirt, right? And so we build very specific

171
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,840
application elements and we really, really focus on those. And then as if you got two, three,

172
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,840
four of those together, then you can start to line up the commonalities and then you can drop

173
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,880
things out. So, you know, I like to say, well, we moved to the cloud in 2019, but we actually started

174
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,280
a few years earlier on building machine learning. And that actually taught us enough to be able to

175
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,560
know, hey, we need it to move this to the cloud. And what did we need to do to move to the cloud?

176
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:42,880
Right? And so we build and we continue to do that, you know, build an application for employment

177
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,200
verification, right? So if people are getting mortgages, they need to make sure their employment is

178
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,960
verified and that their income is verified by the mortgage companies. Once you build that,

179
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,320
hey, wow, you know, there's a new type of machine learning we can do to take care of, you know,

180
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,440
name disambiguation across multiple people named Jack Berkowitz. I have the strangest name in the

181
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,480
world and it turns out there's like six of us on LinkedIn right now. So, you know, that way you

182
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:15,040
can, you can deal with these types of things. So when you say application elements in the context of

183
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,760
the platform, are those applications or are they kind of platform capabilities?

184
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,880
Um, they're kind of both, kind of both, right? So, so a reasoner is a reason, you know,

185
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:36,160
a reasoner that decides about, um, uh, matching of a candidate to a job or a job to a candidate.

186
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,720
So you tell me your skills and I'll tell you the jobs that are available. Is that an application

187
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,640
or is that an ML component? It's kind of both, right? It's, it's, it's, it's actually a number of

188
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,760
ML components all put together. But then I can abstract it as a single API so that downstream

189
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,000
applications like our recruiting application or our internal sourcing application can hit that API.

190
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,240
So it's, it's at both levels. What are some of the other components like that?

191
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:13,280
So, for example, we, we do an awful lot with, um, projections. So we have a lot of different

192
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,680
recommenders and optimizers, right? That'll do, deal with recommendations. So we have a capability,

193
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,600
um, for operational managers, non-HR people to get pushed to them insights about their,

194
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:34,960
their, their team status, right? How many people are leaving? How many people, um, need raises?

195
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,200
What's the birthday every, everybody? You know, I have a large team inside the company.

196
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,000
You know, I'm an operational manager like anybody else, but I still need that HR data.

197
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,800
Um, that comes to me actually on that mobile app where I can check my pay, my, my, my payroll,

198
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:56,400
right? Or my 401k. On the same exact app, I get these HR insights, right? So this

199
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,600
recommendations there. Other areas that we, we build machine learning for are, um,

200
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,520
um, you know, again, not just for clients, but for the internal company.

201
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:11,600
How can we, how can we, you know, answer clients concerns about a regulation in a much more

202
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,800
efficient way? And then we can do that. Have that answer, put it out on a chatbot, put it in the,

203
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:24,720
in front of our, um, our customer service representatives, um, all sorts of different ways.

204
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,960
And so these are, these are, you know, some knowledge management, some recommendations,

205
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,680
some projections, you know, about, are you ready for the shopping season? That's our,

206
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,800
our favorite one for retailers. So we can actually look at, oh, what's the rate at which you're

207
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,800
hiring people? What's the rate at which people are leaving? How many jobs do you have open?

208
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,840
What's the demand? So we can build this small little workforce planning capability,

209
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,120
quickly by assembling our existing components and then have an advantage, uh, for our clients that

210
00:21:53,120 --> 00:22:01,760
use us as a company that is, you know, fully invested in cloud using cloud services at all

211
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:09,040
different levels, including the platform services like SageMaker. Um, you know, you mentioned,

212
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,040
uh, kind of these higher level services. I'm curious, how do you think through

213
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:25,440
uh, what level services to consume from your cloud partner and, or, or conversely, what level,

214
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,880
you know, do you target to build that versus, uh, use external services?

215
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,120
And so I wish I would say that, I wish I could say that there was just like some cookbook out

216
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,400
there, but there's not, right? Um, you know, the best thing for us is that we're, we're

217
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:47,360
closely closely closely integrated with AWS in terms of engineer to engineer. And so people

218
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,240
like me get the heck out of the way and let the engineers talk, which is the best way to have a

219
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:59,920
partnership with a, with a, with a, with a tech group. Um, and so we, we'll look at capabilities

220
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,440
and we'll brainstorm them together. Um, and then we'll iterate. So sometimes we've built things

221
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:12,880
that turns out that that, uh, AWS may have. Sometimes they'll say, hey, we're not building it.

222
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,160
And then, or a third party may say, yeah, it doesn't exist. So we'll have to build. Um,

223
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:24,080
sometimes we have unique capabilities that we need. Um, so, uh, I try not, we try to be more

224
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,440
as a content team and an application team rather than a core technology developer, you know,

225
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,280
like low level code. But just recently we've built some very low level code to build a reporting

226
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,160
application because the constraints, no matter what databases are out there today,

227
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,800
aren't quite what we need for our clients with, you know, the hundreds of thousands of clients

228
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:49,200
we have in terms of cost. And so we had to get down and start to build something. Now,

229
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,920
we, the first ones to say we should open source this or, or, yeah, exactly. So whether we open

230
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:02,240
source it or we find something in the community, um, that can replace it. So, so part of that,

231
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,160
it's a some engineering discipline about, um, making sure that you're, you're extracting your blocks

232
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:12,880
properly so that you, so because the one thing you know about technology, somebody's going to come

233
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:20,080
along with a better mouse trap. And so, you know, you need to be ready to re-architect and re-factor.

234
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,920
And so we think about it architecturally. We budget time for that as we go as well. But it's,

235
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:33,760
it's the reality of the cloud. Mm-hmm. You mentioned the, the, the kind of scope of your

236
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:41,760
customers just now. You also mentioned some scale, uh, figures during your keynote in terms of

237
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,600
the amount of data that you're dealing, the number of transactions. Talk a little bit about that

238
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,000
and the, the broad impact of scale on the way you deal with data. So I mentioned, right, 920,000

239
00:24:52,000 --> 00:25:00,080
clients, 140 countries. Um, you know, we do like 50 million people apply to jobs by our clients

240
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:07,520
every year. We do 38 million people in payroll every year. Um, we do 11 million 1099s, right?

241
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,640
That's an incredible amount of people doing contracting, right? So all that information comes

242
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:20,000
together, the number that I put up on stage and it was, it was kind of fun. Um, we move 2.3 trillion

243
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,080
dollars a year. Um, and the number that, you know, it was hard for me. And, and so we did this kind

244
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,840
of thing where we said, what does 2.3 trillion dollars means? And so if it was a GDP, it would be

245
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,960
somewhere between France and Italy in terms of GDP. Now our payments are not GDP, but it still

246
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,680
gives you a sense of the scale. Now, France and Italy have better food than maybe we do, but,

247
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,920
you know, it gives you, it gives you an idea of the scale. And, and then, you know, the

248
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:55,040
elasticity to process that becomes, you know, insane, right? Uh, I think we do something, I can't

249
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:00,160
remember the number that we put on stage, but it's like 300 trillion decisions by our machine learning

250
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:06,960
every month. You know, and so you've got, well, does that mean 312 trillion queries? No, but it,

251
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,000
it means, you know, the individual decision processes that the algorithms are taking as a process.

252
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:20,160
Um, you know, to somebody who's been around for a while in the business, that's just mind boggling.

253
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,040
I remember when people were pointing the word petabyte, and now we toss around exabytes, and we,

254
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:31,200
you know, zettabytes as if they're nothing, right? Um, I remember buying my first hard drive,

255
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,800
and it had 10 megabytes of storage, and I remember a guy telling me, you'll never be able to fill that

256
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:43,280
up. And we fill it up with single PowerPoint files today, right? So, um, so the scale is kind of

257
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:52,400
amazing. Um, that $2.3 trillion, and everything that that that entails in terms of payments is,

258
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,640
is the number that just sticks in our head every day. Are there specific ways that you have adapted

259
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:05,760
the way that you operate or organize to kind of manage that scale? Well, I mean, I think I talked

260
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:12,720
about a little bit. We, we have a, a real distribute in nature to the development teams. Um, and that's

261
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,240
an important aspect to what we're doing. Um, the other thing is is, is, and I talked a little bit

262
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,280
about this on stage, we really wanted to get to a data-centric culture. So rather than having pillars

263
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,160
of, well, these are the data analysts, and these are the data scientists, and these are the domain

264
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,760
experts, and these are, we got rid of all of that, right? We, you know, they're all together in one

265
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,360
team. So a team, it's, it's modeled after this idea of a two pizza team, but we're not quite selling

266
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,960
the products, right? Um, but it is this notion that we bring everybody together to go solve a specific

267
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,840
problem. So, you know, because we have all these people inside of our company that know HR or

268
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,960
no benefits or no payroll, we can bring people right into the development team to be part of the

269
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:02,160
development team to go solve a problem. And so that's helped us, uh, create very very tight

270
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:08,960
development circle, uh, timeframes, right? And then it's just iterating out of it. So those are our

271
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,760
two keys. First of all, lots of federations, second of all, very small teams that are able to

272
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,320
iterate on a very specific problem very quickly. Um, and, and those two, those teams are, are across

273
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,760
domain, right? We, we literally, we want them virtually at least sitting alongside each other.

274
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,640
Hey, what does this mean? Yeah, this does this, right? As opposed to going through, you know,

275
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,680
paperwork exercises and presentations and stuff like that.

276
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:41,920
The data focused folks on those teams, the data scientists, data engineers, they, are they all

277
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:49,600
embedded within product organizations or do product folks kind of join, uh, into engineering

278
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:56,480
efforts or yeah, that's a great question. So we look at it. So a lot of things in, in our company,

279
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,760
uh, a lot of the teams will look at it as triad, engineering, product, and design. I actually

280
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:09,440
look at it as quads, engineering, product, design, and data science, right? And each one of my teams

281
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,160
has, has all four representatives. And then one point, there may not be a data science problem

282
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,680
to be solved, right? But there's still somebody tracking that project from a data science perspective.

283
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,440
Right? Just the same way as the UX on a certain project may just be the API, not, you know,

284
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,920
not some elaborate UI, right? Uh, or maybe documentation could be the UX. So we have all four

285
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:40,960
domains represented in this quad, fun idea. And the, how long has the company had data scientists?

286
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,640
Probably since they started doing with it back in 1949, right? To be honest, right?

287
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,920
It's a company of accountants, right? Uh, so it's fun, right? Oh, well, this data science using

288
00:29:51,920 --> 00:30:00,080
machine learning. Well, what's linear regression? Right? Uh, you know, it's fun. I, I interview,

289
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,840
you know, people could just get out of school. Oh, I've been, I've learned this thing about linear

290
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,400
regression. You know, it's been around for, since the 1800s, right? So, so I think it's a hard

291
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,760
question to answer. I think if you want to look specifically at machine learning as a practice,

292
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,400
you know, over the, you know, just like everybody else over the past, you know, six, eight,

293
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:26,400
10 years has really been the ongoing of that. Um, you know, it's, it's, it's the end of 2021.

294
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,000
Anybody who tells you they've got more than 10 years of machine learning experience,

295
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,240
unless they were doing neural networks in the 90s is lying to you, right? Um, and so I think,

296
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,240
I think, you know, in that, in that six, eight year time ranges, when we start to really add

297
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:49,200
machine learning, and then by 2016, 2017, we had people really cranking on it. So the company was

298
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,200
very, I think nimble into the new technology, more than I've seen on, uh, on other firms.

299
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:00,720
And when you think about kind of this model that you have or you have the, the,

300
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:08,240
the teams kind of embedded together for a lack of a better term, um,

301
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,000
um, and as opposed to having a standalone data science organization or machine learning

302
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,080
organization or something like that, how do you kind of take full advantage of the,

303
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,760
so, so we, yeah, so we look at them as, we look at them as as sort of cohorts or, or however

304
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,000
you want to call it grouping. So we have somebody in charge of data science for sure, right?

305
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,480
But then people are matrixed out, just the same way as we have it with UX, the same way as,

306
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,320
because they need career paths. I think that's the important thing people, right? And there's

307
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,360
a value for them to get together and, and argue out different problems and everything. I try to

308
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,440
visit with each team every week. It drives me nuts because, you know, they all want to meet

309
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:57,040
exactly the same time. Um, so we, we create this community of practice. Um, so, and, and people

310
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,040
often will say, well, it's a guild and I'm not sure it's a guild as much because there is an order

311
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:06,880
of product managers. There's an Oregon data scientist, but the projects themselves that are being

312
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,080
executed are executed in this, in this group. And then we have somebody leading that, and that

313
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,120
person could be a data scientist, could be an engineering leader, could be a UX leader, or could be

314
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,120
a product manager, leading that specific project. We just want to get the best person in charge

315
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,240
to execute that, that, that project, if you will. We don't care where they come from.

316
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:34,560
I was asking about that, but also, you know, where innovation comes from within the organization,

317
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:42,400
do you, um, is it, you know, kind of tucked into long-standing product road maps, or how do you

318
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:51,040
leverage opportunities that are created by ML and? Yeah, we, we, we kind of, I hate the top-down

319
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:57,040
bottom-up thing, but that's in a way. It's happened. So, yeah, we definitely have where we want to be

320
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:03,200
from a business perspective, but, but our, our job, particularly with senior managers,

321
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,320
is just to give the where or the trajectory, let the engineers and the data scientists say,

322
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,440
hey, I have a way to solve that problem. Maybe a way you hadn't thought about. And so,

323
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,480
we do spend a lot of time on ideation during our development cycles. And we are also always open

324
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,320
to rework as we need to. Now, you don't want to rework forever, but we always give the

325
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,880
opportunity for people to do it. So, we're really, we're, we spend a lot of time talking

326
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,760
why we want to build something. And what we want to build, we let those teams go and decide what

327
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,040
and how they want to build it. Maybe to wrap us up, I'm curious, you're, you know, being in this

328
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:47,600
being in an organization that's very much focused on kind of HR and talent. I'm most curious

329
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,680
about how the company is dealing with, uh, getting the talent that it needs to innovate on the

330
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:59,760
data side, very competitive marketplace, often kind of large legacy companies, quote-unquote,

331
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,720
are considered to be less attractive places. Like, how do you deal with all that?

332
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,800
So, the same fears that I think about every day, I wake up thinking about that, I go to sleep,

333
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,920
thinking about that, I nightmare to thinking about that. But actually, I think we're really,

334
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:22,000
we're really benefiting right now. And we're benefiting for two reasons. One, we took some

335
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,000
steps to get to the cloud. And, you know, at least for what I do, for what you do, people

336
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,360
are attracted to the data. They're attracted to the idea that they can actually work on something

337
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:39,520
with meaningful data. And they're attracted to the culture around data to build these things,

338
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,440
the quads and everything else. And I'm not saying that we don't have any problems getting talent.

339
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,120
But what I would say is, is that we're really successful in being in great people to the company

340
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:55,680
because once they get exposed to it, whether through the interview or, you know, through this type

341
00:34:55,680 --> 00:35:03,040
of, you know, discussion we're having now. And they dig into it, they get excited. And I think

342
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,400
that's the best part is you see these sparkles even over, over all the, you know, zooming in

343
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,040
everything else. See, sparkle in people's eyes when they discover something. And that's a spreading

344
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,440
activation. And so, whether you're an older company like ours that's, you know, going through

345
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,200
this transition or whether you're a startup, you know, I've worked at startups where there's

346
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:29,680
not actually a lot exciting going on. Right? And so you really just have to ask people the question

347
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:35,120
is, what do you want to spend your days doing? Right? You know, do you actually want to spend your

348
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:40,000
days putting out on Twitter that you've got a free water bottle this week? Or do you actually

349
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:45,520
want to go solve a hard problem? Right? You know, I'm an engineer. My favorite movie in the

350
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,080
world is Apollo 13, not because of the astronauts, but because when the guy comes in, he dumps

351
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:55,120
the stuff on the table and says, you know, folks, we got to put this into this to get these people home.

352
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:00,400
And the engineers rise to the occasion. And that's the way we feel about, about talent.

353
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,040
You know, we'll give you something hard to do. Let's go do it. And that helps with our creating

354
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,000
and helps with, with keeping people energized. And so we're actually doing great on that.

355
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,160
If anybody wants to come join us and give it a go, we're more than happy to have that discussion.

356
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,680
Awesome. Awesome. Well, Jack, thanks so much for joining us and sharing a bit about what

357
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:49,520
you're up to there. Great. Thank you. I've really enjoyed the conversation.
