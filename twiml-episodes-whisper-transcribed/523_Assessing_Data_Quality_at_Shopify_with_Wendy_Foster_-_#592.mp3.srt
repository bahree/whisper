00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,320
All right, everyone. Welcome to another episode of the Twomble AI podcast. I'm your host,

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:17,280
Sam Charrington. And today I'm joined by Wendy Foster, director of engineering and data

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,680
science at Shopify. Before we get into today's conversation, be sure to take a moment to

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,120
head over to Apple Podcasts or your listening platform of choice. And if you enjoy the show,

5
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:33,400
please leave us a five star rating and review. Wendy, welcome to the podcast.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,680
Thanks, Sam. I'm so excited to be here. Long time fan, first time participant.

7
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,760
Awesome. I'm so excited to hear that. And looking forward to our conversation,

8
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:50,680
we'll be talking a bit about your group at Shopify and what you do. And digging into your

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,880
perspective on data centric AI and how you make that real at Shopify. I'd love to have you get

10
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,800
us started by sharing a bit about your background and how you came to work in the field.

11
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:07,960
Yeah, for sure. It's definitely been a long and twisty journey. So I'll try and be fairly concise

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,000
about it. But I don't think I'm actually like unique, especially in the data science or machine

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,280
learning field, which is highly cross-disciplinary by nature. But I started out training in the

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,840
humanities of a doctorate in literature and cultural studies. But while doing that work,

15
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:35,320
I was oriented always toward technology studies in particular, which meant I was always hacking

16
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:42,600
and kind of stretching outside of the traditional boundaries of the humanities. And when I finished

17
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:48,120
that doctorate, I think like many folks, I wanted to work in the real world. I did want to stay

18
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:54,600
in academia. And I wanted to work in technology. So I was really fortunate to find, which was at

19
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,720
the time, a very new integrated program. So was at Simon Frazier University, was a master's in

20
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:09,160
interactive arts and technology, which combined humanities and sociology with computer science and

21
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,720
art. And it was a big incubator actually for a lot of incredible design thinking talent that

22
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,880
was aiming at the game industry, which was a big passion point for me. So those are kind of the

23
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:30,200
two big steps that I took that I would say like brought me to where I am today. Like I was fascinated

24
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:38,200
by how data could be visualized and turned into experiences for end users. That was probably the

25
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:47,320
first step I took into data science. And I was fortunate enough after I graduated to move to Toronto

26
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:55,400
from Vancouver at the time and get a job at Copo Books. And I think I was there first the time

27
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:01,640
they were calling it insights and visualization analytics. Awesome. And so what do you do at Shopify?

28
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,440
Yeah, I do a lot of interesting things. I'll say I talk a little bit about my group, we're called

29
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:12,600
Core Optimize, we're part of our core platform group. And there's two big investment areas within

30
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:21,560
Core Optimize. We have a product development capacity. And if I reduce it to its most foundational

31
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:29,240
like product instantiations, it's the reporting and analytic surfaces that we provide to merchants

32
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:33,800
to help them understand their business better and make better decisions for their business.

33
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:39,960
We have embedded within that capacity and algorithms group. So they look for opportunities for what

34
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:46,600
we call horizontal leverage. And what horizontal leverage like means for us is that any algorithm

35
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,840
development we do doesn't just serve our primary group unoptimized but can be utilized and extended

36
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,240
by other groups across Shopify for their product. So a key product for us in that space or key

37
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:05,560
algorithmic product for us in that space is product categorization. So product categorization

38
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,800
is useful for an incredibly wide array of domains. It can help reduce toil and merchant workflow,

39
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,480
but it's also incredibly useful as a facet for search and discovery. It helps other teams

40
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:23,240
make better decisions about merchant bucketing just as some very very small examples there.

41
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:30,440
And we wanted to talk a little bit about data centric AI and categorization is an area that

42
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:37,960
that comes in the play for you. Maybe take a step back. This idea of data centric AI, how

43
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,880
familiar are you with that? And how is that concept landed for you in thinking about the work

44
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:53,720
that you do at Shopify? Yeah, absolutely. Actually, I've been thinking about it for probably like

45
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,200
several years and I don't know if the framing for that existed many many years ago, but

46
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,080
I think when I think about differentials between data centric and model centric like AI,

47
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:13,080
I think back to several companies ago when we're building recommendation projects very small

48
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:20,760
like startup and with a very enthusiastic group of engineers and machine learning experts where we

49
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:28,120
were very very excited about all the parameter tuning we could do and very very excited about 0.002

50
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,440
percent improvement in our model performance. And we were fortunate enough that like startup to

51
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:42,200
have a very rich like wide and deep data set. So our data quality just from a from a coverage

52
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,840
perspective was exceptional. And so like the data was always a rich source for us and we really

53
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:55,000
put like less attention on it than we should have and spent a lot of time playing with micro

54
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,680
optimizations. I don't know that if I framed it in terms of those like kind of concepts that we're

55
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:07,480
talking about now at that point, but as like I moved through my career and went into different

56
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:13,560
organizations and I'll say organizations of different scale in different access to data like

57
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,200
those concepts started becoming more separated for me. And also in organizations of different

58
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:26,200
scale, they'll say Shopify in particular, we orient all of our decision making whether it's

59
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:33,320
technical or product around the merchant problem. So if I talk about merchant centricity is being

60
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:40,680
highly linked to a direction for teams to be data centric versus model centric, they're like

61
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:47,720
they're incapable of being extricated from each other in my mind. If I care about what's doing

62
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,880
best for the merchant and improving merchant success, I want us to care way more in our approach

63
00:06:53,880 --> 00:07:01,640
about data quality and data coverage than I want people to care about like the I think the micro

64
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,960
details of parameter tuning. And I'm going to be incredibly poor and say I know someone's

65
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:16,120
said it better. And I'm pretty sure it was like Andrew in, but it's like I think when he talks

66
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,040
about it, he talks about it as like the difference between being able to make an impact in like

67
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,400
not making an impact at all, but satisfying our engineering needs to engineer things.

68
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:37,400
When you talk about data quality in the context of Shopify, how would you kind of assess data quality

69
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:47,560
at Shopify and what are some of the things that you think about to address, maintain, and improve data

70
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:54,120
quality there? Yeah, I mean, in some senses, it's linked to data governance for us. So a big part

71
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:00,760
of data quality for me is trustworthiness across our different data sets. Are we

72
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:06,120
cleaning and transforming when the transformation is necessary in like appropriate ways?

73
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,240
And when we transform it in one place is it consistent with how we've transformed it in another?

74
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:18,680
Is it reliable? Do we have good SLAs on like those data sets? And especially this is

75
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,320
clearly particularly important for our data pipelines and our model pipelines, like ensuring

76
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,200
we have proper service level understandings of that, both for our customers, but as well as for

77
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:35,480
internal teams who are building off of it. Are we like, I mean, we clearly part of like data

78
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:42,840
governance is ensuring that our merchants data is well protected. So having like structures that

79
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:49,800
keep us attentive to that. And for like the modeling side specifically, a piece that like I care

80
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:56,280
about is coverage and freshness. So with something to use the example of the product categorization

81
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:04,600
piece, our merchants are incredibly unique. So in Shopify, we understand them as like entrepreneurs

82
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,840
because their behavior is very robust to change in dynamic, right? So it means that like,

83
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,640
is they see the world changing around them? They're constantly updating their products or

84
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:22,200
their inventories that allow them to be able to like sell better and have higher, clearly higher

85
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,440
success for themselves. But for us, what this means is that ensuring that we're always bringing

86
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:35,800
fresh data into our modeling like approaches is not just important, but it's critical. Like it's

87
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,000
more critical than worrying about the model architecture itself. It's not to say we don't do model

88
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,760
improvements because also like things like you have to update your model. You can rely on like the

89
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,000
architectures that you kind of get for free with the incredible work that people have already done.

90
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,240
But for product categorization, like an evolution where we did care about updating the model was

91
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,960
bringing image data into our consideration versus just relying on textual data. So like we do

92
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:10,040
care about ensuring our model is like robust, but like attentiveness to like how the data is changing

93
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,400
underneath us. Sometimes on a daily basis is the most interesting and exciting thing for us,

94
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,040
I think. So that's the data centricity part. Like we need to care about it because it's an

95
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,400
integral part of how merchants behave on our platform. Interesting. It sounds like in a

96
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:33,960
center saying that the kind of the time scale of innovation around the data versus the model is

97
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,920
very different with the data. It's something you're thinking about constantly. Whereas with the

98
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:45,960
model, you know, there are kind of bigger boulders that you might take on like integrating the image

99
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:53,400
information, but changes to the model that come from changes to the data that those that changes

100
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:59,880
are fewer and further between. Yeah, you nailed it. Absolutely. It's the dynamism of the data that

101
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,160
I think is most important to us. And as I said, like produces better model results. The more

102
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:13,640
attentive to it, we are the more we foreground coverage versus keeping tweaking accuracy of

103
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,840
existing things we're already pretty good at. And because like helped us be more successful

104
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,440
with this particular investment anyway. Elaborate on that a bit. What does foreground and coverage

105
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:30,600
mean to you? Yeah. So if I think about like merchant products because we have a high degree of

106
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,760
diversity in the types of merchants who are using like the platform, but also in the types of

107
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:43,080
products they sell. And not just between merchants, but the the rapidity of which merchants

108
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,240
change in pivot their own merchandising base as well. So it's just a highly dynamic like product

109
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,720
environment has to be like foregrounded so that we can understand if like what we're even inferring

110
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:00,680
from them is going to be like useful for it. So the expansion of coverage piece to me is like you

111
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,560
can get really good at it like a category of it like we're inferring product type from our product

112
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:11,160
data, which was like the first step we took with this product categorization model and get really

113
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:19,720
good at it because to a large extent like merchandising and inventory around clothing is relatively

114
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:26,520
like stable or we can we can make like the gap jumps like much easier there. But our merchants who

115
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:32,360
made cell clothing today might pivot and sell power tools tomorrow or like our long film merchants

116
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:38,760
right. So it requires us to like not just be good at one very large category of product type,

117
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:44,760
but to be very very good at starting to like build out understanding of some of like those dynamic

118
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:50,120
changes that are happening with transformations in industry for merchants. So we want to be

119
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:55,720
equally good at inferring product type for clothing as we want to be for like home goods as we

120
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:03,320
want to be for bicycles and power tools. Yeah, it's it's a it's a pretty rich tail of product types

121
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:11,480
for sure. Yeah, I'm thinking as an example of this thinking back to my conversation the last

122
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:19,000
conversation I had with Salma's former head of data at Shopify and we spoke quite a bit about the

123
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,800
impact of COVID on the company and I'm imagining as you're describing you know these merchants that

124
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,840
are selling clothes one day on all of a sudden you know you have masks pop up on the platform and

125
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,480
you know no one was selling masks before. Is that the kind of thing that you're referring to?

126
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,680
Yeah, I think it was probably like more acute or you saw those changes happen more frequently

127
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:50,120
during the most impactful early stages of of COVID but I would also say that like that dynamism

128
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,040
and like adjusting your business to meet market needs even if it's not as rapid a transformation.

129
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:02,920
We see as typical behavior for entrepreneurs like figuring out like their business models

130
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,680
especially in very very early stage anyway. So it's not just something you need to look at when we're

131
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:12,600
going through a pandemic it's just constant. Yeah, it's always yeah for sure.

132
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:19,160
And is the impact on categorization when you when you have wholly new products that are

133
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:27,400
introduced to the platform or is it different products offered by different vendors or what are

134
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:33,080
the conditions that that most impact the categorization effort and impact coverage?

135
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:41,000
Yeah, it's probably like a bit of both but I would say the the higher interest at least

136
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,440
for me right now is on merchants updating their products. I mean like one of the ways we've

137
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:56,040
productized this at Shopify is so merchants have what's called an administrative space when they

138
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:02,520
log into the Shopify platform and in that administrative place they have multiple operational

139
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:08,280
pages where they can do things like update their products and like shift inventory between

140
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,200
stores if they have multiple stores but for for product type or we're really focused is on

141
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:19,720
their product page and that's where they do their their product updates at new products change

142
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,960
existing products and where we surface our inference there is in a category for them which is

143
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,560
called product type so merchants have a bit of a choice here they can choose to set their own

144
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:36,600
product type where they can use our inference so in some ways it's like a nice virtuous circle

145
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,120
because if they don't like our inference they can use a custom type and then we can learn from

146
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:48,200
what they didn't like about our label but it's it's actually like a key function for them to get

147
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:54,520
that right because the idea of a product type is connected to a product category taxonomy

148
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:00,440
that isn't just useful for us in other parts of Shopify to help merchants merchandise better or

149
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,120
market their service is better or for merchants to be able to do that themselves using themselves

150
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,480
are third party apps but they typically are because they're entrepreneurs sell across multiple

151
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:18,040
channels so that product type like the taxonomic product reference is actually a thing now ideas

152
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:24,120
of taxonomies are like not interesting to like merchants in general this wanted to be right and

153
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,120
exportable to like Facebook marketplaces or like Google marketplaces right wherever else they like

154
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:38,040
sell their products and so like when I think of like us being able to like get this thing like

155
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:44,360
right and have the highest coverage for them I think about how they can actually use it to like

156
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,720
amplify their success across all of the channels they care about and if they're updating products

157
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,680
like very very quickly we have to like have a real-time inference and we have to make sure that

158
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,440
that inference is correct enough so that it doesn't become a frustrating aspect of a workflow

159
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,760
that changes often for them if there if there are a merchant who is involved in dynamic product

160
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:13,640
updates and quite frankly most of them are because if you're like a one or two person like organization

161
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,480
you're going to be constantly in those pages updating how you describe like your your products like

162
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,720
how you even like even images around them right because you're always trying to like tweak and

163
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:30,120
optimize that experience to find your audience in your fit so like they're highly experimental they

164
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:37,640
change things all the time thinking about that taxonomy how much of that or what's the relationship

165
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:47,240
between human curators taxonomists and machine machine learning in creating that taxonomy

166
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:53,480
yeah so for the initial stages of our product categorization we kind of did a couple of things

167
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,400
we leveraged like the Google product taxonomy to have a reference point for what that what that

168
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:05,240
tree structure should look like for merchants and we also employed subject matter experts

169
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:11,320
to help us like label those initial efforts both within house and as like a third party service

170
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:18,760
so once you reach a certain critical mass of like I mean we focused on um a clothing or a peril

171
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:25,480
um to start with to get right really well because you don't need um a lot of uh like high domain

172
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:31,080
expertise to to label pants effectively or a pair of socks so we got a lot of leverage from that

173
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,960
and it's also one of our biggest categories um merchant categories that Shopify so

174
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:42,040
it was a great like scaffolded place for us to start so once we got enough um good accurate

175
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,160
like labels to be able to have confidence in our inferences on the product type we were able to

176
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:53,400
build this experience um to surface the inference um into that operational page that merchants use

177
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:59,240
to manage their products and once we had that space in then we could start expanding our

178
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,800
understanding right because of the the fields that like surround that operation so our inference

179
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,800
if they want to accept it or reject it the custom types that they would add product titles product

180
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,960
descriptions are also in that operational page as well as tags so additional metadata are all um

181
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,560
merchant generated um so we've been able to like kind of bootstrap the model with like subject matter

182
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:28,520
expertise labeling a really well-known domain and then start trying to stretch it into unfamiliar

183
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:35,320
domains what's an example of domain in this case is it clothing to power tools or is it more

184
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:42,200
um you know within clothing one to the next yeah yeah I guess like actually all of it if I'm

185
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,200
being honest so it's like like clothing will have like your clearly your top level um uh

186
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:56,040
I guess like product types that are like most recognizable to us so like pants shirts um socks um

187
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:03,320
but like so you want like the the ability to be able to navigate down and number of like leaves

188
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:08,840
in a sock category for sure and it gets harder clearly as you get more granular because then it

189
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:16,280
becomes for for merchants and I think for buyers as well um uh more that maybe that becomes more

190
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:23,000
the domain knowledge how you define a very particular pair of pants like as chinos versus like

191
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:30,840
um blue jeans it starts becoming um uh just more refined but like I think really like the the

192
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:39,160
parent part of like that taxonomy node is the most important one to get right um so a pair

193
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,960
of clothing would be like the large categories but yeah to your point also extending it to like

194
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:51,400
other um sellable domains and I mean like those could be power tools it could be home decor

195
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:56,760
and living when you think of the broad like areas we would want to like um search for useful things

196
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:01,960
under but it can also be incredibly niche like there's going to be um massive amounts of like

197
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,240
edge cases where there's one product that someone's selling and it's a very particular type of like

198
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:13,720
let's say like iron on badge or something right yeah so it's a really complicated like area like

199
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,920
well-known domains are clearly easier to like access and learn than um your edge cases

200
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,800
and when did you first introduce images to the categorization?

201
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:28,760
oh it would have been last year like the the work on this is probably

202
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:38,360
only about a year and a half old now so it started out um modeling just using the textual

203
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:45,480
descriptions um attached to um products so the title description um product description

204
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:50,760
I think was also vendor and some of the metadata we also collect from it so like tags that they

205
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:58,360
would that merchants would add um to those product like uploads um and then it was like later on

206
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:03,400
in that year maybe maybe it was like a handful of months later where the model was extended

207
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:09,080
to incorporate images. the images were already in place part of this data set so you didn't have

208
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:16,760
to collect any additional information um how did you vectorize the images and did you

209
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:23,560
did you already have kind of an embedding space for product images or there had been experiments

210
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:28,520
done on done on it before so if I'm recalling correctly I actually think it was done during a

211
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:33,720
hack days um someone who I actually like I think was actually one person who ended up bringing

212
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:40,600
um over to the the team had done a hack days on um creating vector space for like the images so

213
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:45,320
the images product images are stored separately from the textual

214
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,480
descriptions for um uh the product type because they're like media assets are

215
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:59,400
a different like data store right so um merging like the pipelines was like non-trivial like um

216
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:06,120
um absolutely but absolutely necessary improvement to the model for us to I think be able to

217
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:12,040
aren't I mean my feeling is is that it was necessary in order for us to be able to start extending

218
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:18,760
into um subsequent domains and also build I think like real future thinking around

219
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:23,880
how we want to extend the model and our understanding of products in the future because

220
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:30,120
you look at like um how merchants as I said they're highly experimental and one of the things

221
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,240
it's like really important to them or I think images like comes into play arrest understanding

222
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:41,320
the images piece better um we're not doing this today but I'm kind of want the team to be thinking

223
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:47,720
about its day is like what happens when that converts to 3D right so I think it's like a table

224
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,320
stakes like activity now for when you go browsing you want um not necessarily the whole augmented

225
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:58,520
reality experience that's still available in very limited spaces but you want to be able to like

226
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:05,160
touch that image on your screen rotate it see its dimensions um and I think like for me the

227
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:11,240
the the image that's typically uploaded with a product is just a stepping stone for us to be

228
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:18,840
able to do um inference from um 3D models that merchants might want to um might want to engage to

229
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:26,040
we supported in like parts of the Shopify platform so it's a it's a necessary addition meaning

230
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:34,600
it currently merchants can upload 3D uh or multiple perspective images yeah there's aspects

231
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:41,000
through like their experience where they can like uh be able to like create 3D experiences for

232
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:48,040
buyers to be able to like do the image like manipulation um which is uh I think like I consider

233
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:54,840
it table stakes in terms of like by your experience now um not all merchants do that um but I think

234
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:02,280
it's like a growing expectation that there's that affordances like I mean to to an extent it's like

235
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,400
for a merchant to be able to provide like that image they have to have probably a certain amount

236
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:13,720
of like resources but those are getting more and more accessible um and I do think it's a space

237
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,720
we need to be thinking about in terms of building into um anything around product understanding

238
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:27,560
we do going forward curious about maybe other other challenges involved in uh in this particular

239
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:35,480
aspect of the projects so there's there's challenges in I don't know I want to frame it um I

240
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,280
mean there's technical challenges that coming work that come with like working and productionizing

241
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:49,080
with like large scale models so this particular like work really like I think um it was a primary

242
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,400
use case I'll say this way a primary use case for the evolution of our internal machine learning

243
00:25:53,400 --> 00:26:01,880
platform so it was definitely pushing on technical boundaries um from a product um perspective um

244
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:08,280
we had to open ourselves up to like new spaces where this would be leverageable and like as I said

245
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,600
we orient like all of our decisions and what we decide to put our time against

246
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:18,280
unlike the highest merchant problem so this requires like the team maybe this is true of a lot of

247
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:24,920
like teams that um are building um algorithms they want to have like impact on the world outside

248
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:32,040
of like um their lab or like their team space but um it can't be a built it and they will come

249
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:37,560
kind of like venture right it's like the decision to work on product categorization and the team

250
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:44,680
had to do a lot of like outreach to teams across Shopify to be able to identify um the very best

251
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:50,680
opportunities um for like product fit right we can build our own products around it and

252
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,480
they said that creates a bit of a virtuous circle for us because we get better and enriched data

253
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:02,920
from um having um especially like that surface to our admin but we also want that like that

254
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:09,320
inference to be important for the company outside of our team so creating those relationships

255
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:14,440
and intersecting road maps is incredibly challenging and I actually think it's like probably one of

256
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:21,320
the biggest like challenges for um uh industry like level machine learning it's like it's probably

257
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:27,880
very very rare that one team can support like both building like the algorithm and the constellation

258
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:32,760
of products around it without making those relationships with other teams so your company also has

259
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:38,680
to be at scale it's like what we actually saw is that like working on like the algorithm and trying

260
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:45,800
to like build against it almost in parallel was like an impossibility right so yeah a building ahead

261
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:51,160
you have to have like strategic foresight to understand whether the right things to like build um

262
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,960
and then like making those like connections to product spaces that would benefit from it

263
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:04,280
becomes so much easier the hardest part about it is like really just getting teams to understand

264
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:10,520
the runway right so if you're doing like especially if you're like building in um a new space

265
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:16,520
you have like an MVP model um but you may need like like the decisions you make around how to

266
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:21,960
improve and even if it's just from a data coverage like perspective have to be with an i about

267
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,160
where that like um output of like that model is going to find a home is it for an internal

268
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:33,000
application then you probably like build your roadmap instead of like optimization priorities

269
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,960
around a completely different space then if you know merchant facing teams are going to leverage it

270
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:45,480
right you mentioned that it you found it really difficult to both build the model and build the

271
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:53,400
products around the model and i'm curious that that's a little bit counterintuitive um in the sense of

272
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:04,600
um you know if you've assuming you've got the the products uh domain expertise on the same team

273
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:11,240
um you know minimizing communication barriers just having everything in one place you think you

274
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:17,960
can move quicker but it sounds like there were some inherent challenges uh with that and i'm

275
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:24,200
curious about those yeah it's mostly a timing thing right and this is true of like um where you

276
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:30,440
want um uh that model like output to be useful for teams outside of yourself where you have even

277
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:36,520
less control about the staging of the product building against the algorithm development right so

278
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:43,560
when the model development like cycle and this is actually true of like any machine learning work

279
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:50,600
or data science work probably generally um the cycle of how you build that is very very different

280
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,200
from the software development cycle or the product development cycle more generally so um the

281
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:03,320
model has to be like built with some and we have to have some degree of confidence in it um before

282
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:11,320
like product opportunities can be software developed against it right so i think like the it's

283
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:17,000
not that like the challenges is like can we think of products to build around like the output of

284
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,000
a product categorization model the challenges how do you time that for internal team like if we

285
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,920
own all of the teams um product teams and the other teams that are building against it like the

286
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:35,720
staging is probably easier right um well it was easier for us but um we don't want to just be the

287
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:41,320
only team like leveraging this output so if we want another team across Shopify let's say our

288
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:46,200
search and discovery team to be able to use the output of a product categorization model

289
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:52,120
for a search facet we have to understand where on their roadmap that work might be located

290
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,560
if at all and if it's not be able to influence them to put it on their roadmap and then ensure

291
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:03,640
the way we're having to like um optimize if that's required um to be a you to make the output as

292
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:09,000
useful as possible for that other team like this artwork gonna be able to time out in a line with

293
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:14,200
how they've scheduled their work like it's complicated enough to do all of those like

294
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:22,520
roadmap alignments within one team clearly far more possible um much much more difficult to do it

295
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:28,280
with um external teams even within your own organization especially when you're hoping as we are

296
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:35,560
that this horizontal like asset can like help not just one team or two teams but a dozen teams right

297
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:42,760
so it's it's mostly just about managing timelines and getting like um other teams who don't support

298
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:48,680
this kind of work like the algorithm development work on their own teams explicitly understand like

299
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:55,160
the actual like length of time it takes um it takes to build these kind of products because that's

300
00:31:55,160 --> 00:32:03,160
also an unknown too uh Shopify recently published a blog post about Merlin uh a new ML platform

301
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:09,080
at the company can you talk a little bit about the relationship between your team and

302
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:16,040
that platform and and even the categorization product and that platform um how do they fit

303
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:23,160
it together yeah um they fit together very closely actually so um the machine learning platform

304
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:29,160
is a relatively like new investment for Shopify as well like i'm probably going to be a mistake

305
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:35,960
in here but i think it's less than like two years old so the teams that are working in Shopify

306
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:42,840
on building um machine learning applications were the initial use cases for Merlin so the the team

307
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:49,320
that um uh i support who is building these horizontal like algorithms were one of like the first

308
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:56,440
use cases for Merlin but again like i say this is from like a product against a like data platform

309
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:02,440
is a product and so building and evolving something as complicated as a machine learning platform

310
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:10,920
in parallel with a team who's building um large-scale like multi-model models is um a challenge

311
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:17,320
so uh we feed in like requirements and we we fall along the road map and as we're able to take

312
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:22,520
advantage of more and more of the capabilities that the machine learning platform makes available

313
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:30,280
we migrate to them right so i think we started out um uh with the algorithms team um building

314
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:37,720
stand-alone like pipelines that um we're built in a way that when Merlin was able to support those

315
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,160
like on-platform like it was a fairly simple like migration effort um and same with taking

316
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:48,760
advantage of like the feature store that's being built out too it's like we're moving into like

317
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:54,280
near real-time um inference production and that's on their road maps so when they're able to support

318
00:33:54,280 --> 00:34:00,680
that we'll be able to to merge there but um it's an exceptional team doing incredibly hard work

319
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:07,160
with an enormous amount of stakeholders across the organization so um i'm super happy with like

320
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:12,760
their progress and their level of like partnership with us like um we bait they basically are

321
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:19,400
filters for like um the pain the team is experiencing and um uh that gets like road mapped into

322
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:24,840
feature sets that are prioritized by them we've talked quite a bit about the categorization

323
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:32,840
use case um what are some other use cases that your team has been working on so i think like

324
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:37,880
for us the product space is not completely exhaustible if i'm talking to just about like the

325
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:44,280
algorithms work um but that doesn't mean the domain space of like merchant value is exhausted

326
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,800
that we can do in much smaller efforts so i think when we think about the large um large scale like

327
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:56,120
data work to me it's like a lot of its exploratory array like what large data sets do we have

328
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:01,880
that we think can provide merchant value um i think we still have a lot of like um mining that

329
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:09,160
we need to do on the product data set um specifically um but smaller areas that i think are useful

330
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,360
for merchants that can help them understand their business better is to really help them like

331
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,880
benchmark against themselves like be able to have like actually sensitive instead of out of the

332
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:27,320
box forecast for their businesses um it sounds like simple work but like the the models for like

333
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:33,880
supply and demand on each individual merchant um use case can look incredibly like different

334
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:41,880
right um uh some merchants even have i think one merchant like described it to me is um they have

335
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:49,960
like a model where they loan things out and then get them back and so how something like for forecasting

336
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,680
them if you're doing like inventory forecasting for them would look very different than inventory

337
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,880
forecasting for a merchant that sells something and once you sell it it's gone they're like

338
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:07,320
well we get stuff in from distributor a and then we lend it out um to a whole bunch of customers

339
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,880
and then we wait to get that back and then we're also getting like new products from like different

340
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:16,200
domains into the like how do i understand my business better i'm like that is a really hard

341
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:21,400
challenge probably not super unique especially like merchants are very creative about how they

342
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,840
manage their businesses now but it's enough of an edge case that it wouldn't fit into a generalizable

343
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:33,640
like forecast model we might be want to be able to provide to merchants um as a tool um to use in

344
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:39,400
their admin in our analytics home as an example so i think that that one's really hard

345
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:46,440
i think imagine that Shopify supported that at all the the lending use case you know let alone

346
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:52,360
forecasting it but even the inventory management parts of it and some of the more basic

347
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:59,960
mechanics of that that business yeah the the inventory like management support i am

348
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:08,760
pretty sure doesn't like uh doesn't like account like fully for that kind of like model so

349
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:15,960
it positive it's not part of like our tooling but um merchants like create are incredibly creative so

350
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:24,840
they find ways to like like use the platform for work for their immediate needs and then

351
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:30,760
creative ways often like sometimes they contract out like new services or find third party

352
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,440
apps that can support them um to be able to extend parts of their business so they're being

353
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,640
creative about how they support that too and for like one person like merchant businesses um maybe

354
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:48,360
they can like uh maybe they can kick love that uh to a large extent for themselves too but yeah

355
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:54,680
for for them it's like like really understanding how to like build that kind of business like

356
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,440
effectively is um not just a tooling challenge from any e-commerce solution they might use Shopify

357
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:05,720
in this case but also from an understanding perspective so the analytics products we provide

358
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:11,080
need to like i don't know if we'd be able to like handle the specificities of that use case but

359
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:16,600
i know how flexible we can be on like building that kind of like forecasting model that allows

360
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:22,360
merchants to have some autonomy over controlling aspects of how you define how that model should work

361
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,280
um i think it's probably very similar with pricing to like the thing they're also interested in

362
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:33,640
is like tools that help them experiment with pricing more effectively returning back to this idea

363
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:40,920
of data-centric AI versus model-centric and and the way that you've incorporated that into the

364
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:48,200
categorization use case you talked about incorporating in the user-provided labels

365
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:54,760
into the into the loop how do you operationalize that yeah so we have that product like pretty

366
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:01,000
well-instrumented um really like you can you can always like we always want to improve on that

367
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,840
because we learn more but we know if like if we provide an inference when you think of the field

368
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:12,920
it's like a light suggestion in it so when they have the product type in their admin it's like a

369
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:17,800
great out so they can say hey we're recommending this product type for you to use and if they click

370
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:23,320
in the text field then it populates that text field and then they can attach it to like their

371
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:28,760
inventory but they can also choose to ignore that field and there's an opportunity for them to enter

372
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:35,160
a custom type and also what they'll do regardless of whether they select a product type or not is

373
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:42,280
usually include um tags um descriptive tags for their product which is um like helps to make

374
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:48,280
them more discoverable it's a really rich source of um metadata for them to like leverage so

375
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,320
we know if they accept our suggestion if they click on that field and then apply it um to their

376
00:39:53,320 --> 00:40:00,040
product so that's all part of like our product um dataset model awesome well Wendy thanks so

377
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:06,680
much for taking the time to chat and share a bit about what you and your team are up to very cool

378
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:31,960
stuff thank you Sam it's been a pleasure
