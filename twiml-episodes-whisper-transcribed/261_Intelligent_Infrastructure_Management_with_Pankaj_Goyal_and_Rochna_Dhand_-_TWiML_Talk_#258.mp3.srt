00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:29,120
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:33,760
Before we get going, I'd like to send a huge thanks to our friends at HPE for sponsoring

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,080
this week's series of shows from the O'Reilly AI Conference in New York City.

6
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:44,560
At the conference, and in my chat with them, HPE's punkage Goyal and Rochena Don discuss

7
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,600
how large enterprises can unlock the value of their data using AI, and they detail the

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,800
workings of HPE InfoSight, which is the company's cloud-based solution for helping IT organizations

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,760
better manage and ensure the health of an enterprise's IT infrastructure.

10
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,680
Now I've previously written about this category of AI-enabled operations management tools,

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,080
which folks refer to as AIOPS.

12
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,400
It is a very interesting use case for AI, and as you'll hear, HPE has an interesting

13
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,120
story in this space.

14
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:26,760
For more information on HPE InfoSight, visit twomalai.com slash HPE.

15
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,760
All right, everyone.

16
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:35,600
I am here in New York City for the O'Reilly AI Conference, and I'm with punkage Goyal,

17
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:43,760
and Rochena Don, punkage is the vice president for AI and HPE product management at HPE,

18
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,320
and Rochena is director of product management with HPE InfoSight.

19
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:51,880
Punkage and Rochena, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

20
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
Thank you.

21
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,680
Thank you, Sam, for having us.

22
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Absolutely.

23
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,680
Absolutely.

24
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,480
I am excited to jump into our conversation.

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,160
Punkage, you're key noting at some point.

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,560
One is that, or both of you.

27
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,560
Both of us.

28
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,160
It is today, afternoon, and our topic is how HPE's helping our customers get the best

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,320
out of their data by using AI.

30
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,320
Awesome, awesome.

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,800
We'll dive into that, but before we do, I'd love to learn a little bit more about your

32
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,800
background.

33
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Why don't we start with you, punkage?

34
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,800
Sure, Sam.

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,720
I'm a computer science engineer by background, by education.

36
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,600
Back in the days, actually, I did my bachelor thesis in national language processing when

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:39,560
we were trying to parse a mixed language text, a mixture of multiple languages, and since

38
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,160
then, it is fascinating to see how the world of machine learning has evolved over the

39
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,680
last 10 to 15 years.

40
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:54,360
I did a stint at McKinsey and company as a management consultant in tech industry, and

41
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,640
I also ran a startup in the mobility space back in India at HPE.

42
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:06,360
I today lead the product management for this exciting space of AI and high performance computing.

43
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,840
And before that, I used to run business operations and strategy for our data center business.

44
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
Awesome.

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,840
Awesome.

46
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,320
Thank you, Raja.

47
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,920
So I started, again, my training as a masters in computer science, and I did an undergrad

48
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,680
degree in computer science as well.

49
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,440
And my specialty actually was computer graphics, and so as soon as I graduated, I made a

50
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,080
B-line for SGI, which was the hot computer graphics company at the time long, long ago.

51
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,720
But ever since then, I've worked at a series of high growth startups, mostly through

52
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,200
the category defining startups.

53
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,840
I worked for Love Cloud, which was Netscape Founder Mark in recent startup after he was

54
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,840
ESP, right?

55
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,840
Yes.

56
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,840
Cloud before Cloud.

57
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
Wow.

58
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,840
I saw it before.

59
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,600
You know, it was before virtualization came along, and so Cloud was hard to do before

60
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,680
there was virtual machines.

61
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,480
And so I was there for about five years.

62
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,360
We learned a lot, and from there, I went to VMware, and I said virtualization is going

63
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,480
to solve a lot of problems.

64
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,720
And so I did product management there.

65
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,720
I did a lot of work in the hypervisor, and we centered the management of flagship product.

66
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:18,360
And then from there, I went to Nimble Storage, and Nimble was really small.

67
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,880
And that is where we thought about how to bring AI to the IT industry alongside our main

68
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,560
line of business, which was storage enterprise storage.

69
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,120
And then Nimble Storage got acquired by HP approximately two years ago.

70
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,720
And I've been heading on product management for Infosight, which is our AI ops product

71
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,720
at HP.

72
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,240
So, Pankaj, why don't you walk us through a little bit of the presentation that you're

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,360
giving and the way you think about AI at HP?

74
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,360
Sure, Sam.

75
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,560
So, we are really in living in some really exciting times today.

76
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,480
AI has come a long way in terms of expanding the world of possibilities.

77
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,280
And it can be attributed to the data explosion that we have seen, and also the compute power

78
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,240
explosion that we have seen over the last, I would say three to five years.

79
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,520
Even in our personal lives, AI touches each of us very closely.

80
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:18,000
My two kids, five and two year olds, they actually know how to talk to our voice assistants.

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,040
And it's amazing to see how they interact with all these AI driven machines and gadgets

82
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,960
in our homes.

83
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,400
We at HP truly believe in this power of transformation, which is being enabled through AI.

84
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,560
It is almost a natural step where we collected a lot of data over the last five to ten years.

85
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,880
And now we are trying to get the real insights which can impact the way we live and the way

86
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,640
we work in our daily lives.

87
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,080
We are truly excited about this potential and it is one of the top priorities for us as

88
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,600
a company.

89
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,000
When we think of AI, we really think of it in three pillars.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,760
Pillar number one is how we are bringing the best people, the best technology and the

91
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:09,320
best partners to our customers, to adopt AI, to help them in their journey towards an

92
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,800
AI lead transformation.

93
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,640
And I'm going to talk more about it.

94
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,400
Pillar number two is how we are adopting, how we are changing ourselves by using AI machine

95
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,040
learning as a next frontier.

96
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:30,240
And how we are enriching our product portfolio to enable new customer experiences, especially

97
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,680
in the field of data center operations, which are becoming more and more complex day-by-day.

98
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,960
And what Roshna is leading is tremendously impactful and we are already seeing solid positive

99
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,440
results.

100
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,360
And then Pillar number three is how we are investing in the future of AI.

101
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,360
As you all know, AI is a dynamic field.

102
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,160
Not all the problems have been solved.

103
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,920
There's a lot of research going on to understand the next generation of algorithms, the next

104
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:06,520
generation of technologies which will power those algorithms.

105
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:13,400
And through our efforts by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Labs, we are investing in these efforts

106
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,600
specifically around memory driven computing, which becomes really critical as the data set

107
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,240
size increases.

108
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,480
And through our efforts to understand the next generation of accelerators like dot product

109
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,760
engine, which is our efforts to effort towards it.

110
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:38,840
So these are three pillars for us, AI for our customers, number two, AI within our own

111
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
products.

112
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,400
And the number three is AI for the future.

113
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,160
When you think about AI for your customers, how do you characterize where your customers

114
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,160
are?

115
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,000
Each piece of huge company, lots of customers, lots of different sizes and shapes and industries.

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,560
Is there any kind of one way that you think about where that customer base is with regards

117
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
to AI?

118
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,320
We are definitely seeing that all the customers are not at the same point in their AI journey.

119
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,760
We think of customers in three different stages on the maturity of their AI adoption.

120
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,720
There are a large set of enterprise customers which are just getting started.

121
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,280
So they do not know the exact AI use cases.

122
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,680
They are almost anxious about adopting AI.

123
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,760
But they are trying to figure out what to do about it.

124
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:33,160
Number two is we have a set of customers which have figured out where to get started,

125
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,760
but they are experimenting a lot.

126
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,200
I think a lot of enterprise AI is experimentation today.

127
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,640
And then number three, we have a set of advanced customers.

128
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,480
And to their credit, they have been investing in AI for 5, 10, 15, 20 years.

129
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:55,520
And they have reached a stage where AI is almost in their DNA of how they work, how they strategize,

130
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:00,320
and how they shape up the future of not only their own company, but the whole industry.

131
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,400
And we work with them a lot as well.

132
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:10,000
Depending on the maturity stage, the help that these customers need from HPE differs.

133
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
If you are an enterprise which is looking to get started, HPE helps them by providing

134
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,760
them the advisory services to get started to understand which what is happening in the

135
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:29,200
industry, what is the landscape like, what are the use cases to get the maximum ROI.

136
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,720
If you are running an experiment, your problem statement is different, your problem statement

137
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,960
is where is my data, what is my data pipeline, how do I get my data scientists, how do I prove

138
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:44,600
the ROI so that I can get more investments from my CIO or from a CIO.

139
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:52,400
And there we follow a solution centric approach where we bring in our best in class people,

140
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,040
data scientists, solution architects, data engineers.

141
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,800
And we bring in our best in class technology, right from compute to storage from edge inference

142
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,320
to training in the data center, and then we bring in a curated list of partners who can

143
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
help in that journey.

144
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,400
There is a lot of fragmentation in the ecosystem.

145
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:17,320
Many startups are coming up, everybody is talking about AI.

146
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,440
We act as that trusted partner to help our customers understand which partners to work

147
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
with.

148
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,720
And through this combination, we are attacking specific use cases for our customers.

149
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,920
For example, today we work with five leading car companies in helping them in their self-riving

150
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,640
projects.

151
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:42,320
We are working with leading manufacturing companies in the US and in Asia to help them improve

152
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,720
quality control on their factory floor.

153
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,160
We are working with some of the leading consumer tech companies to solve some of the largest

154
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
AI problems.

155
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,400
We are working with some of the leading city governments to enable smart cities and to

156
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,600
build the cities for the next 10 to 20 years.

157
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,680
And we have built and we continue to build some of the largest AI infrastructure or some

158
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,920
of the largest AI supercomputing power or supercomputing infrastructures at a country level, at a

159
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:23,400
research level to help provide large scale access to these capabilities for startups, for

160
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,720
research, and for enterprise purposes.

161
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,680
And that we do in the US, in Europe, in Japan, across the world.

162
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:38,920
With all these success stories, we are truly doing some incredible work at HP to push forward,

163
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:44,600
to help our enterprise customers go through this journey.

164
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,400
Personally, can you elaborate on InfoSight and where InfoSight fits into that mix?

165
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Right.

166
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:57,040
You know, that's the overarching grade view of punkage that you gave about where all HP's

167
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
AI is going.

168
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,720
What we've done in InfoSight is we've taken a sliver of that and what we've told people

169
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,040
is if you're buying a product from HPE, there is AI embedded in that product and what

170
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,000
that will enable that product to do in these enterprise products or a data center products.

171
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,680
What that enables that product to do is our ultimate vision, it is self-managing, self-healing,

172
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,400
self-optimizing.

173
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:27,840
So for example, if you're buying a storage appliance from HPE, be it nimble storage,

174
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:34,640
three-par storage, it comes embedded with thousands of sensors that it's sending back to our

175
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:40,720
own HPE Cloud, where we're doing a very aggressive AI on and have been doing for a very long

176
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,160
time, more than seven years now.

177
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,880
And as a result of what we have been able to do with that data that's coming home across

178
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,760
the globe, across the install base, we have been able to predict issues that can happen

179
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,360
in the field and prevent issues that happen for customers in the field.

180
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,760
And so when you're buying one of these appliances and you install them in your data center,

181
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,080
for example, there's a lot of benefits you see from them.

182
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:16,920
So for example, the amount of time and skill level you need to manage one of these devices

183
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:17,920
goes down.

184
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,920
We've measured recently doing surveys of our customers anywhere from 75% to 90% fewer

185
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,280
resources required.

186
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,360
They run optimally.

187
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:34,200
We have a customer recently who participated in an activity with us to actually quantify

188
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:38,280
what they've been able to get through buying these products that are embedded with AI that

189
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:43,200
managed themselves, and they showed us how they saved close to a million dollars and

190
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,920
not having to buy additional hardware equipment because through the machine learning that we

191
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,400
do in the back, we were able to tell them how they can recover resources and optimize

192
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:57,440
how they run applications on these capabilities.

193
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,840
So basically what we're doing is saying, hey, the IT industry, the IT people today are

194
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:10,600
used to enabling AI for their businesses, whether it's selling widgets or optimizing your sales,

195
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,920
targets, etc.

196
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,000
But what is AI doing for the IT industry itself?

197
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,720
And that's where Infosight comes in, is where we actually enable these capabilities,

198
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:25,640
these products to manage themselves, and they can be software products or hardware products.

199
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:31,640
You mentioned that the devices, like the storage devices, have thousands of sensors in them.

200
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:37,000
I think of thousands of sensors, I think of an aircraft engine, like the classic GE example.

201
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,600
What are the sensors in a storage array?

202
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,920
And so they can be pretty complicated devices.

203
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,840
Our customers consider the mission critical because they have mission critical applications

204
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,840
running on them.

205
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:54,120
They could have had a trading application running where latency, which is a concept of

206
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:01,600
a response time, if they miss latencies by some seconds, it can be pretty, the financial

207
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,240
losses can be pretty big.

208
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,920
So these are capabilities that have to, while lives don't depend on them, they are mission

209
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,680
critical to businesses.

210
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,960
So the sensors are widespread.

211
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,920
They could be sensors that measure in lots of details how the different components inside

212
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,480
the box is doing, so how is the CPU performing right now?

213
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:26,160
CPU itself has tens and 20 sensors itself.

214
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,440
There's a concept called a CPU ready.

215
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,840
The is an application waiting to get compute, or does it have the computer needs, which

216
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,960
application is getting the compute?

217
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,800
Memory has a lot of sensors.

218
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,840
If you look at how an application flows with the CPU, there's memory, there's lots of

219
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,840
cards, how what is the health of each card?

220
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:50,200
And so if you actually pry open these things, there are a lot of factors that can indicate

221
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
health.

222
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,960
And then there's the whole software stack, right?

223
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:59,920
Because every stack behaving the way it needs to behave, there's very complex file systems

224
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,920
and these.

225
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:04,960
And so who's consuming the most resource, who's waiting for a resource?

226
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:09,560
And then there are some more traditional sensors like fans and temperatures and stuff like

227
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,520
that, but some of them are very critical.

228
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,400
The interesting thing is the infosite idea came from the acquisition of Nimble Storage.

229
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,920
And Nimble Storage's first line of code was written about eight to nine years ago when

230
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,400
the company was founded.

231
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:28,520
And by that time, there was this vision that IoT has arrived, not just for consumer products,

232
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,200
but for enterprise products and the data center as well.

233
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:38,840
And so when our engineers wrote the first line of code, they had that vision in mind of

234
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:42,240
they needed to telemetrize everything that they're writing.

235
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,040
So they actually built very deep sensors into each and every line of code, thinking that

236
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,240
later when they go into debugging mode or when they understand how products behave in customers,

237
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,040
environments and data centers, this will actually help them, right?

238
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,800
I mean, initially what we had was like a doctor status scope.

239
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,800
And now what we have are these very fancy MRI machines, so that's kind of the equivalent

240
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,880
they had those MRI machines in mind when they wrote that.

241
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,960
And so it tells you about the health, it tells you about the performance, it tells you

242
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,040
what events that are going on, falls as well.

243
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,040
It tells you about configuration settings, each customer sets these things up with the

244
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,880
different configurations.

245
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,880
I think we often talk about technologies that were born in the age of the web and technologies

246
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,800
that were born in the age of mobile and how what's available impacts the way technology

247
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
evolves.

248
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:40,360
And the idea of enterprise technology being born in the age of IoT and AI and what the

249
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,520
implications of that are, I think, is kind of an interesting one starting from kind of

250
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,680
taking advantage of all of this telemetry data that's available and pulling it in so

251
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,120
that something can be done with it.

252
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Right.

253
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,920
So there was a leapfrog advantage right by the time we started.

254
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,960
There were a few nasiers in the industry and they said, well, enterprise products, I don't

255
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,600
think mission critical applications, sensitive applications for businesses.

256
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,080
People are not going to send you data just like you connect IoT or consumer product

257
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,080
through IoT.

258
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,520
They're not going to send you this data.

259
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,800
We found out that our attach rate for this data was 97%.

260
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,320
These were enterprise companies.

261
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,040
You mean the customer had the option to do that?

262
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,040
They had the option.

263
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,680
They had to turn it on because it was a time and be one share of customers would send

264
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:33,200
us streaming data from their highly sensitive equipment back to our cloud and trust us

265
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,040
with that data. We figured by default, we leave it off and the customer can opt in and

266
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,760
we found 97% of our customers opted in.

267
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,480
Some of them initially said they were policies within the companies that they could not send

268
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
data out.

269
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,640
They could not connect to the cloud.

270
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:54,000
They had never done it while lo and behold, the first time they ran into some problem,

271
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,040
we showed them what we could do for other customers.

272
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,480
If you're sitting on these data and the tools that we have to interpret it, the value

273
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:02,600
then drove them to actually turn that on.

274
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,240
And of course, this is on machine data.

275
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,280
It's not customer sensitive data.

276
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,240
But it is that almost like a revolution where the enterprise products are now seeing what

277
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,760
consumer products can do for them.

278
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,000
At the end of the day, if it's going to save you 80% of your time, that you would otherwise

279
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,640
send, spend in troubleshooting, hairy issues by looking at 20 different graphs, have ten

280
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,640
people involved, and the worst of all, if you talk to enterprise customers and IT people

281
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,320
that actually manage these devices, they have to call multiple vendors for support.

282
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,960
What we did at Dimmel Storage was because we had so much automation and insight built

283
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,320
into our products.

284
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,280
We did not have level 1 and level 2 support engineers.

285
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,400
We never hired those as a startup.

286
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,360
We hired directly level 3 engineers, so how you call on the phone and someone asks you

287
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,440
and tells you to reboot the thing or just gives you some list of a script that they have

288
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,760
and then they pass you to the level 2 engineer.

289
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:03,480
And then finally, you know, you talk to the gods that are actually talking to the developers.

290
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,560
We eliminated, we never hired and to this day we don't have level 1 level 2 engineers.

291
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,800
You call, you get, go straight to a level 3 engineer.

292
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:14,600
So the issues that the level 1 and level 2 people would have resolved have been eliminated

293
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,920
through machine learning, AI and automation.

294
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,000
And so those issues don't happen for the customer.

295
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,200
So if the customer is facing an issue and thinking this thing is not behaving the way

296
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,120
you want it to, it's probably a very hairy issue.

297
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,640
So they just call and they talk to a level 3 person.

298
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,040
We're also very proud that when you actually call a level 3 person, we answer the phone

299
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,040
in less than one minute.

300
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,440
So it's not like we're queuing people up because we don't have level 1 level 2.

301
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,120
Our customer satisfaction scores are extremely high, 4.9 out of 5.

302
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,600
This is customer self-reported saying how satisfied they were.

303
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,240
And even these hairy issues we solve in less than 45 minutes.

304
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:55,400
These are issues that can take weeks sometimes to resolve if you don't have that level of

305
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:59,680
insight and you have and build the machine learning models to automate.

306
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:06,640
Can you maybe walk us through one of these, an example of one of these hairy issues that

307
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,200
comes up that may take hours or weeks to troubleshoot and how the data and machine learning

308
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,920
plays into solving that?

309
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
Definitely.

310
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
Definitely.

311
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:21,120
And I can't name names, so this is a large customer in the oil and gas industry.

312
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,200
They make additives for additive products for oil and gas, a very global company.

313
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,400
Sounds like this is going to be a real example.

314
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,080
It's going to be a real example.

315
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,720
The revenues are about $6 billion.

316
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,560
Okay, you can Google it now and see who this is.

317
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:40,800
But they came to us and they were looking to buy more gear from us and this actually

318
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,920
is a story from three-part storage arrays that we sell.

319
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:50,120
And they said they just cannot add more workload.

320
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,400
They've been having issues with workloads that are running today.

321
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,320
Of course, the response times have been sub-milliseconds, but they have not been able to expand

322
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:03,120
the footprint and they were running VMWares, BDI, which is a virtual desktop product, which

323
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,000
is very popular in very large companies.

324
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,680
They actually had consultants come in from different vendors, which also I shall not name

325
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,680
your old friends, but they had different vendors come in and there was one vendor assignment

326
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:20,080
that was engaged for about months, trying to figure out what the problem was, what

327
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,760
why they could not put more workload on these devices and why there was erratic behaviour.

328
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,720
The people collected a lot of logs, etc. that couldn't fix it.

329
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,400
This was the time when three-part was just coming on to InfoSight support the product

330
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:38,280
itself, because like I said, it started with nimble storage, not coming on to all HB products.

331
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,520
And so we three-part came on, we started collecting a lot of the telemetry, starting doing a lot

332
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,760
of the analysis on that.

333
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,560
And literally within a matter of days, we could show them, you know, it takes time for

334
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,480
the data to come and for us to analyze.

335
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,080
And then what we do is we show the data to our support people and we reflect it back

336
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,080
to the customer through a portal and they could log in.

337
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,840
And out of the thousands and thousands of virtual machines they had, they could pinpoint

338
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,640
a few virtual machines that were behaving strange.

339
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,160
And what happened in those virtual machines was it's a virtual desktop, so when the user

340
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:14,080
logs out of it, it triggers an antivirus scan.

341
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,760
And that takes up a lot of the resources.

342
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:22,920
But to find those needles in the haystack was very hard before we had all this modeling

343
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,680
that they plugged into.

344
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,640
And they were able to solve the problem in as a result.

345
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
But how did they...

346
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
But how did they...

347
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
As we wanted to sell them, but they...

348
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,640
What specific data and what specific models allowed them to solve the stuff?

349
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,560
Yeah, so there's lots of different models that we employ.

350
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:43,640
The data that we get from, for example, from VMware, tells us on the compute layer.

351
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,120
Now, the thing to notice, I'm talking about, we were selling storage products to them.

352
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,640
But that doesn't prevent us from collecting data from products that are running on top

353
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,800
of the storage product, right?

354
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,800
The application owner at the end of the day cares whether their application is running

355
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,800
or not.

356
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:58,880
The business cares about the application.

357
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,240
The many layers of hardware and software underneath they don't care about.

358
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,840
So what we've decided, we will collect data from the entire stack.

359
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,800
Because at the end of the day, we want to show you where some problems are coming.

360
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:16,360
So from VMware, we collect intensive CPU data, intensive memory data, audio data to see

361
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,560
all these little cards that are running are desaturated or not.

362
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,480
And then we correlate.

363
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:27,640
And so we have some, today, mostly supervised machine learning models.

364
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,120
You know, we do regression analysis for some, we do classifiers for some others.

365
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,760
We are just starting to go into unsupervised.

366
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,760
But we correlate this data across the stack where we see what looks like a problem.

367
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,480
A lot of these expert define as well.

368
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,960
So over time, what we've done is when people report problems, we have gone and then labeled

369
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,840
our data and tagged our data to show what do problems look like and then what do solutions

370
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,840
look like.

371
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,840
And so there's a lot of that, that modeling that we have done in the past as well.

372
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,760
And so we are sitting on these patterns where the patterns can detect and say, this is

373
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,200
a problem and this is what solves the problem.

374
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,440
And so if you look at our UI, there's recommendations that we make and say, you know, your number

375
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,480
of one recommendation is you can move this virtual machine to another resource that has

376
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,400
excisey specification number two recommendation is you can throttle this virtual machine.

377
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,320
So these problems on finding the needle in the haystack we're able to do because it's

378
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,880
pattern recognition.

379
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,120
If you were a human being going through each and every virtual machine and seeing how

380
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,600
it was behaving, you know, it would just exhaust that.

381
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,920
You take the two weeks.

382
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,760
Well, not the two weeks, I think that people working on it for weeks and weeks.

383
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,480
So it would be more of a, I would say at the scale of a year or so, because we're talking

384
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,080
about thousands and thousands of virtual machines that these environments have.

385
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:49,400
So you need to have patterns that that you can just scan through and we do it automatically

386
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,400
all the time.

387
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,920
You don't wait for somebody to complain and it can highlight.

388
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,720
And so the models that you're working with, do they, you mentioned supervised on supervised

389
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:05,520
and regressions and things like that, that they tend to be fairly simple, traditional machine

390
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:14,760
learning, time series kinds of things or deep learning like what's the spectrum of complexity.

391
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,840
So for the models today, they're so, they're relatively simple, you know, there's not

392
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:20,480
depends on the use cases.

393
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,160
Sometimes we do a lot of forecasting, for example, we help customers with capacity planning.

394
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:32,120
And they're simple forecasting tools that we use today, we use Arima, for example, what,

395
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:39,400
and then for the prediction capabilities, a supervised are, you know, regression analysis

396
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,640
of classifiers, we do decision trees.

397
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,160
Very simple for right now, but we have a team of data scientists that are just focused

398
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:57,160
on going deeper into into the data now, yes, they are now going, they're exploring more

399
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,440
neural networks, for example, and to see what they can get out of that.

400
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:07,080
You know, initially, when we started eight years ago, we just did even simple SQL queries

401
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,760
and pure correlations and that revealed a lot of, a lot of capabilities that, you know,

402
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:15,160
nobody had done this for the IT industry prior.

403
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:23,040
I'm imagining if you've got a dashboard that you're presenting to IT folks and telling

404
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:29,320
them they need to go do thing X reboot the, reboot the storage array or something, probably

405
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,800
in more detail or more fine grain.

406
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:38,000
But this whole idea of explainability, like it's not just do this, it's like why, you

407
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,800
know, you need to do that.

408
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,400
So what degree does that come up?

409
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Right.

410
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:47,600
So, you know, there's always initially people who want to be cautious, especially if it

411
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,160
been the systems emission critical, when you tell them to do something they want to know

412
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:57,200
why, you know, their jobs depend on this, if they do something wrong and the application

413
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,960
goes down, you know, there's financial consequences of that.

414
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,080
And but over time, people build confidence.

415
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,720
So what we do today is, you know, predicting what's going to happen and knowing how to

416
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,600
prevent it based on the models that you've trained in the past is one thing.

417
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,720
But we've also gone and built because of this, there was a necessity to build automation.

418
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,240
And so when when we do, you know, today we have, I don't know, more than there's hundreds

419
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,360
of thousands of deployments in the field across the globe, right?

420
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,080
And the models are running on all of them.

421
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,360
So the scale is huge.

422
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,640
And like I said, we don't have many people supporting that, right?

423
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,480
So we build a lot of automation and these tools will actually then detect that something

424
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,880
is going to go wrong.

425
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:45,000
For example, they may be some memory issue that's going to happen, that will impact certain

426
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
applications.

427
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,800
So we automatically notify the customer.

428
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,480
What we hear from our customers often is somebody called me and told me, no problem is

429
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,840
going to happen, which I've never experienced before.

430
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,920
It's usually me banging on the doors right and saying, there's a problem, help me.

431
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:05,880
And so we notify the customer and it is very easy for them to quickly see the symptoms

432
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,600
because we can tell them what the symptoms are.

433
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,800
And if you tell them where to go, look, they can go look there and see it for themselves.

434
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:18,200
It's just a problem that when the scales at which IT admins manage these devices, they

435
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,440
don't know where to look, let alone beforehand, even after issues happen, they don't know

436
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,440
where to look.

437
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,080
So we show them the proof of the pudding, there's a little bit of information, we give them.

438
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,720
Now the customers have built so much confidence in these predictions that we make, that they

439
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,320
have actually asked us, since you know this with so much confidence, why don't you fix it

440
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
for us?

441
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,480
And that is actually where our vision is as HPE, we are now building capabilities to go

442
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,520
fix these issues for customers.

443
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:48,320
So once you buy the product, you put it in your data center, you have these eyes and

444
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,760
ears and hands that are going to take care of it and fix it for you.

445
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:58,400
And the reason we can do that at reasonable cost is because we've automated it, right?

446
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,560
We're not putting people behind that.

447
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:06,120
But customers do ask, initially they ask, skeptical and they do ask, but they very quickly

448
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,240
see the credibility behind it.

449
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,960
Because you can actually, once you know where to look, you can look and see that this is

450
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,360
actually something that's going on.

451
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:23,200
So much of transitioning through that maturity cycle, that's the way I think I did a paper

452
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,440
on industrial AI and kind of build out this model, reflecting the way I saw folks deploying

453
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:36,080
that kind of AI in industrial settings, that first they're using it to help them monitor

454
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:42,240
or then they move to helping them optimize and then they move to helping them control

455
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,560
or automate.

456
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:50,000
And it's kind of a maturity spectrum and it's really the, you know, where a given company

457
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
is, it's all about trust, like how much do they trust the technology that do they trust

458
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,800
AI to give them recommendations that will actually optimize what they're trying to do?

459
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
Right.

460
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,080
Do they trust that, you know, if they hand over the keys that it's actually going to

461
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,360
fix problems before they start?

462
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,360
Right.

463
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:14,600
And so we are at that point where we tell them what to do, but we tell them very precisely

464
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,520
because of how much we know about that environment.

465
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,320
And they have gone, gotten to the point where they're trusting us because they're seeing

466
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,680
when they do make the changes that we ask them to make, that it makes, it actually solves

467
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,920
the problem, right?

468
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:33,640
So the keys are in their hands now and the next stage is for us to go, they're asking

469
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,520
us to take the keys and do the job for them, right?

470
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,960
They don't want to drive around anymore.

471
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,880
They just want Uber to show up and take them there.

472
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:49,920
I imagine providing a rich level of detail is part of what helps create that trust.

473
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,480
Yes and no.

474
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:59,520
I think I do find that sometimes sharing other customers example, sometimes it's the brand

475
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,560
that you have built is enough.

476
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,000
Each customer is different.

477
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,520
There are those that are very hands on and they like that.

478
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:16,240
But there is a trend where a lot of our customers just can't scale anymore and they are more

479
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,120
willing to trust you with making changes.

480
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,600
You know, I saw that when I was at VMWare where we introduced this capability, which was

481
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:31,200
you could take a workload and application, move it around physical resources, separate

482
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,120
compute boxes automatically, it's called VMotion.

483
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,920
VMotion was a big deal, huge.

484
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,440
But I was at VMWare when before we introduced VMotion and people told us, never let you

485
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,440
do that.

486
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,040
How can you move a workload and look at where it is today?

487
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,600
And the way we built that was we built a safety net around it and we said, okay, we'll

488
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:52,760
come out and recommend that you should move this workload to this destination, but you

489
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,920
will be the one hitting the go button.

490
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,520
And they said, fine, I can look for that.

491
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,040
They tried that and they said, well, every time it tells me I hit the go button, so I might

492
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,320
as well let it go.

493
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,440
And I had one customer saying, well, I will let it do it, but I'll sit there and keep

494
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,160
watching it for a while.

495
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,040
And, you know, I'm sure that customer is not watching it anymore.

496
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,040
Right.

497
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,200
So trust has to be built, yes.

498
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,320
So this started with storage or really grew out of things that you were doing at Nimble.

499
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,280
How, I'm trying to get how much work it is to go to the next thing, like, you know, so

500
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,560
from one storage thing to the next storage thing is probably pretty easy, but then, you

501
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,040
know, to servers is that, right?

502
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:37,600
So actually, so our goal is to bring it out, to bring infosite capability to the entire

503
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,040
HB portfolio and it's not going to happen over time and we don't, it's going to happen

504
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,040
over time.

505
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,000
It's not going to be instant.

506
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,720
We don't want it to be instant.

507
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,040
And so there's a, there's a two prong.

508
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:54,960
Even if you had a magic wand like you and, yeah, if I had a magic wand, yes, I would,

509
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,200
but I know I don't.

510
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,000
If you want to be careful when you're rolling these things out, so we went from one storage

511
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,360
to the next storage pretty quickly and we're taking a two prong approach where, you know,

512
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:14,800
we talked about the machine learning models, the AI, the sort of the fun stuff.

513
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,960
There is a less fun sounding, but very important capability, which is the infrastructure in

514
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,960
the back, right?

515
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,440
This data pipelines is data lakes and this ETL, there's capabilities are the data scientists,

516
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,880
the tools that they used to just mess around and see what patterns come up and what distributions

517
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:33,520
they say they just, they do their own thing.

518
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,680
And so what we're doing is we're helping different teams build this, but leverage from our learning

519
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:43,800
of what worked and did not work in terms of infrastructure.

520
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,200
And also in terms of use cases, there are some use cases that lend themselves, they're

521
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,080
the low hanging fruit, use cases.

522
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:55,920
Each product also may have different pain points in the industry and, you know, on how they

523
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,760
compete with other products in the industry.

524
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,200
So we help other customers, other products find the use cases.

525
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:05,080
There are some models, some automation that lend themselves pretty readily and there are

526
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,440
others that will have to be built, definitely.

527
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:12,360
So that two prong approaches, we're helping people, other products build this, but build

528
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,720
it to our specs.

529
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,400
And we're building actually a services oriented architecture in the back where all these

530
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,120
capabilities that amend that go into infrastructure will be turnkey for the other products.

531
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,640
So we will build that and then we'll say, okay, you know, product, the new product that

532
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:34,160
wants to do this, this learning in the cloud for their own product, they come to us and

533
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,280
then we give them turnkey solutions, we give them a data pipeline, we'll give them the

534
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,800
data lake, but they can put their data, we have all the tools ready.

535
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,080
So we're going to put this platform that they can plug into.

536
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,840
And that's how we will, we will roll out even farther and beyond.

537
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:55,920
The idea here also is one plus one equals five, right, where for the, not even three,

538
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,840
you're going for five, that's AI, right?

539
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:06,320
But the idea is you can see patterns across the board that are much more valuable than if

540
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,120
you just showed, did correlations, for example, within your own silo, right, when the correlation

541
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:15,800
jumps the silo, imagine for the application, sometimes this is all the same resources

542
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,800
underneath, right?

543
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,760
Be my thing, it's a sensor server, it's a storage, it's a networking device, but from an

544
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,520
application's perspective, application owners perspective, it's all the same, that all

545
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,360
means to end to his application, right?

546
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,560
And but if you can correlate, you can eliminate, you know, things that look like false positives

547
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,280
in the silo, for example, but together, they may make sense and you can pinpoint accurately.

548
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,960
So there'll be some domain learning in each capability that will build over time, but

549
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,520
it is lots to leverage already that's in place.

550
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:52,920
So punkage, when you think about the capability that you're bringing to bear with InfoSight,

551
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,600
and maybe even more importantly, what you're learning from engaging with customers around,

552
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:06,000
you know, data and telemetry and AI and automation, how do you see that more broadly impact

553
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,960
the portfolio at HP?

554
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,760
So broadly, we are making our portfolio more intelligent.

555
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,800
And we are enabling new user experiences, which were not possible in the past.

556
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:26,040
And HP InfoSight is a great example of how we can do that in a data center environment.

557
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:31,720
We have similar efforts going around on the Aruba side, where Aruba is bringing some

558
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,920
of these capabilities and even more at the edge.

559
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,320
So overall, if you look at HP's vision, we do want to bring in new experiences and

560
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:49,120
intelligence to our end customers to make their life simpler so that they can spend their

561
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,600
time on more value added activities.

562
00:37:52,600 --> 00:38:00,160
And they can benefit from a lot of automation, a lot of prediction, and ultimately move

563
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:07,080
to this long-term vision of self-healing, self-maintaining data centers.

564
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:13,320
So we are truly excited by that, and the other angle of that is we are learning a lot while

565
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:19,000
we are building InfoSight, not only on the customer side, but also on the backend side,

566
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,440
in terms of how to build these large-scale data infrastructure.

567
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,880
And we are taking some of these learnings to our customers who are trying to solve the

568
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,880
same problem.

569
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,400
How do I handle large amounts of data?

570
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:39,680
How do I connect my data pipeline from where I'm collecting data to where actually I can

571
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,040
train my data to where I can infer from the model that I've trained.

572
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:49,720
So we are taking that learning as well as to our customers to help them solve similar

573
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:54,560
problems for different use cases in their own environments.

574
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,480
So as an organization, as a company, we are definitely learning a lot.

575
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:05,920
We are moving fast, and we are committed to enabling this vision.

576
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,800
As you talked about, the things you're learning and the challenges that you're experiencing

577
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,080
being reflective of the things that your customers are experiencing, more broadly, there's

578
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:22,160
a move on the part of a lot of enterprises to kind of serviceize their products, if that

579
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,160
means anything.

580
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:27,640
GE doesn't want to sell you an aircraft engine anymore with the 2,000 sensors.

581
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,640
They want to provide it as a service.

582
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,440
Do you, and it's open to either of you, do you see IT moving in that direction?

583
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:45,000
I guess it already has in a way with SaaS, but with the physical infrastructure that we're

584
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,320
delivering to IT organizations.

585
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,320
Right.

586
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:51,640
And I can take my attempt at that.

587
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:55,320
There's been a little bit of a pendulum effect, and I think we're kind of settling in

588
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,760
the middle of that pendulum right now, where the traditional was, you own everything,

589
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,600
you manage everything, the more control you have, the better it is for your business.

590
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:09,000
And then it started to swing in the other direction, where it said, I'm going to put everything

591
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
in the cloud.

592
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,720
I just don't want to own anything on my box.

593
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:17,640
I want to go to OPACs, and I'm going to sit there focused on my differentiator, and

594
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,960
the industry started believing, well, everything is going to the cloud.

595
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,880
And I know a lot of people in the investment banking started to believe, the other thing

596
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:26,880
is going to the cloud.

597
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,320
What's going to happen to these companies that are sending equipment for the data center?

598
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,000
Well, now cloud has been out long enough where people have had experience with that, enterprises

599
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,880
have had experience with that, and learn that that is not the, you know, the be all that

600
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,480
they thought it was, and it's not going to solve all the problems.

601
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,280
And so it's coming back to the middle where there are, they need people have decided they

602
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:53,160
do need to own infrastructure, have their own infrastructure, go with a best and best

603
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,800
of breed infrastructure, have control on it, etc.

604
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,240
But they're also now looking at seeing how, instead of managing day to day, they can

605
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:07,720
do services on it in the sense, have, pay someone, have a managed service provider for them,

606
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,720
for example.

607
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,600
And then managed service provider is a great model for companies like HPE.

608
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,560
Just for the record, Infosight is given away for free today.

609
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,200
And so what you're saying is, we will use technology to do as much management automatically

610
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,760
for you for free customer.

611
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,200
But there are those higher level services that we need to offer that are very contact

612
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,760
sensitive to that customer or are very specific to their needs.

613
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,400
And we have now very thriving business built on services of these capabilities.

614
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,120
Now whether the SKU transfer from paying for the device and just all the way paying to

615
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,880
services, I can't comment on that.

616
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:50,440
I don't think that's in the works today, but that is more of a financial exercise, right?

617
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:56,680
But the idea is, first you leverage technology to automate a lot of those things, predict,

618
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,720
prevent, automate.

619
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,240
And then you offer services at a higher level, right?

620
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:05,760
It's an interesting question because the labor component is a big part of the cloud value

621
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:12,000
proposition if you, through automation, eliminate that, that kind of impacts where that

622
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,760
pendulum settles for a lot of organizations, I think.

623
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,400
It's also that services, in my view, is an experience.

624
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:25,440
And it is not an experience only for the IT team.

625
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:28,840
I truly believe that it is an experience for the whole company.

626
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:33,200
So it is an experience for the CFO, it is an experience for the CIO, it is an experience

627
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,680
for the business in a GM, it is an experience for the CEO.

628
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:45,760
And we are treating Azure services and experience addressing all these stakeholders.

629
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:52,800
HP GreenLake is one of the top priorities for us, which provides us as a service workload,

630
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,520
as a service IT in a hybrid environment, whether it is on-prem, whether it is managed service

631
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,280
providers, or whether it is off-prem.

632
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:07,520
In this hybrid environment, how can we provide this as-a-service experience to data scientists,

633
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:15,000
to machine learning developers, to IT teams, to CFOs is a big focus area.

634
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,440
And actually recently, I think four or five months ago, Blue Data joined HP family.

635
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,760
And Blue Data is our effort to provide AI as a service.

636
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:32,960
It essentially provides containers as a service, making it super easy for data engineer or

637
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,720
a machine learning developer or a data scientist to spin off the right AI or the right big data

638
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:45,360
environments in their infrastructure, and in a truly hybrid way.

639
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:49,920
So we are moving in that direction where we want to provide this as-a-service experience

640
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,280
