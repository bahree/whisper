00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
So what's your name?

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
My name is Harov Suckman.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.000
I'm the CEO and founder of Kepler Vision Technologies.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
We are a spin-off company from the University of Amsterdam.

00:15.000 --> 00:19.000
We bring to the market body language recognition software.

00:19.000 --> 00:23.000
Whether I tell you a story looking like this,

00:23.000 --> 00:27.000
or looking like this, or looking like this,

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
I may be able to, I may be saying the same thing,

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
but my body tells a different story.

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Many possible applications for it,

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
they are sort of blindfolded looking at the market.

00:42.000 --> 00:46.000
Because self-driving cars will need body language recognition,

00:46.000 --> 00:52.000
security, but people focus on elderly care.

00:52.000 --> 01:00.000
We can also recognize that people are drinking or eating,

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
if people have fallen, if they are laying on the floor,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
or laying on the couch, or laying on the bed,

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
or if people get upset, and that's what we do.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
And how does it work?

01:10.000 --> 01:13.000
Based on post-estimation, or I think the figures

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
that look like post-emptimation.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
Skeleton, combined with raw pixel data,

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
because with just a skeleton,

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
you cannot distinguish a person eating or drinking.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.000
And what's the origin of the technology?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.000
The technology.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
We build it from scratch.

01:29.000 --> 01:33.000
So we use the available open source,

01:33.000 --> 01:38.000
deep neural networks, but we train it with our own data.

01:38.000 --> 01:41.000
We annotate it, we annotate the data also ourselves.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
And how do you collect the data?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
From partners.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
We have potential clients that we build proof of concepts projects with.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.000
Okay, and is there a demo?

01:53.000 --> 02:17.000
No.
