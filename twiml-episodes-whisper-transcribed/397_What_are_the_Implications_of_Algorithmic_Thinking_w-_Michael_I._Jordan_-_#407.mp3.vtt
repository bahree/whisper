00:00.000 --> 00:09.140
All right, everyone. I am super excited to be here with Michael I. Jordan, distinguished

00:09.140 --> 00:14.200
professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the Department

00:14.200 --> 00:20.800
of Statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. Professor Jordan, welcome to the

00:20.800 --> 00:27.320
Twimmel AI podcast. It's my pleasure to be here. It is super exciting for me to have you

00:27.320 --> 00:36.120
on the show. You are connecting or we are connecting with you being in Italy right now.

00:36.120 --> 00:43.600
And so, you know, folks, we might experience a little bit of delay, but wanted to, you

00:43.600 --> 00:49.560
know, start by having you share a little bit about what brought you to Italy. Interesting

00:49.560 --> 00:58.800
turn of events where Italy was a early hotspot for coronavirus, but now it sounds like things

00:58.800 --> 01:05.000
are going pretty well in the country. Yeah, it's, there will be a bit of a delay, but

01:05.000 --> 01:09.800
I hope that people will appreciate how amazing it is that we're talking across the ocean

01:09.800 --> 01:17.040
right now and packets are flying back and forth and yeah, it's very, very striking.

01:17.040 --> 01:22.280
My spouse is Italian and I have Italian passport, therefore. And so with the kids, we decided

01:22.280 --> 01:28.960
we'd come to Italy about a mid-summer because it's, this is the eastern, far eastern

01:28.960 --> 01:33.840
side of Italy and life is really quite open. So, restaurants are open. You can walk around

01:33.840 --> 01:40.360
town and the kids can have a normal life. So, that's why we're here. We probably can't

01:40.360 --> 01:45.960
stay much longer because I need to get back and start work back in Berkeley. But it is

01:45.960 --> 01:50.360
an example of a country. Maybe it's because it's smaller and maybe because they had a

01:50.360 --> 01:54.920
trauma early on, but people took it really, really seriously. And I think for about four

01:54.920 --> 01:58.760
to six weeks, you really literally didn't go out of your apartment. It was the whole

01:58.760 --> 02:04.040
bloody lockdown. And if you follow the trend, they really brought it down to near zero and

02:04.040 --> 02:09.080
now it stays around a few hundred per day and they do the contact tracing and so on and

02:09.080 --> 02:13.720
so forth. So, somehow they'd learned quickly that there's a few things to do that are

02:13.720 --> 02:20.080
right. And I think it's taking everybody else a lot longer to get on board with the simple

02:20.080 --> 02:24.280
but critical things to do to keep this thing in check.

02:24.280 --> 02:31.360
That's amazing. That's amazing. Well, I'd love to start by hearing a little bit about

02:31.360 --> 02:39.880
your career and how you know, how your interests in machine learning, our performance

02:39.880 --> 02:45.880
solutions and all the other things that you work on began. In 2016, you were named one

02:45.880 --> 02:54.120
of the most influential computer scientists worldwide. So, did you start out with that

02:54.120 --> 03:02.600
in mind? No, I didn't. I'm glad that computer science somehow welcomed me in along the way

03:02.600 --> 03:09.440
because I really had it in a different direction. I think I was influenced by philosophy.

03:09.440 --> 03:17.360
There was a autobiography I read by Bertrand Russell when I was a kid that it's like three

03:17.360 --> 03:25.040
volumes and he was sort of the early part of the century, last century thinking about the mind

03:25.040 --> 03:33.600
and the brain and logic and thought and psychology and so on and so forth. And so that got me sort

03:33.600 --> 03:39.280
of kind of aware that there could be a science emerging of the mind and aware that it had

03:39.280 --> 03:43.600
something to do with their traditions and philosophy of inductive thinking and deductive

03:43.600 --> 03:50.600
thinking and so on and so forth. But that was my vague awareness. I did not grow up with

03:50.600 --> 03:58.960
particularly good education and I just, and I'm going to continue to this day, a little

03:58.960 --> 04:06.160
less random. But I was intrigued by the idea that the big problems of our day had to do

04:06.160 --> 04:12.720
with not just computers but with algorithms and with dealing with uncertainty in the

04:12.720 --> 04:18.360
real world. So, computers, what I found missing in computers when I finally came to computer

04:18.360 --> 04:24.760
science by the time I've been already in cognitive science and seeing kind of humans who

04:24.760 --> 04:29.760
were thinking somewhat logically but not entirely. And it was intriguing to me how we can

04:29.760 --> 04:34.200
be not logical but at the same time we're so powerful. And so computers didn't seem to

04:34.200 --> 04:40.440
have that and it felt to me that computers needed to move out of the purely deductive world

04:40.440 --> 04:45.000
that they'd gotten kind of focused on. So, when I, by the time I came to computer science

04:45.000 --> 04:49.920
I was already interested in inference and in decision making and economic ideas and so

04:49.920 --> 04:57.760
on so forth. But it really is kind of random walk and I like to say that I really like interacting

04:57.760 --> 05:02.880
with students and helping them with career decisions and helping them think about what is

05:02.880 --> 05:06.160
the future and where it's going and all that. Talking about that I think is really helpful

05:06.160 --> 05:12.160
not just to me but for figuring out my next, my next steps which are always big and unsure

05:12.160 --> 05:19.680
but especially for younger people to orient themselves in this kind of thicket of ideas.

05:19.680 --> 05:27.920
That's awesome. So, your academic home at least at Berkeley is in the WCS and stats but

05:27.920 --> 05:35.680
you've also done quite a bit of work in cognitive sciences and biology as well. Are you still

05:35.680 --> 05:43.440
active in those communities? Yeah, I'm active in them less so right now my main focus is bringing

05:43.440 --> 05:51.440
economic ideas together with inference and computer science. But even there, you find themes

05:51.440 --> 05:58.400
that are familiar from past lives. So, in fact, economics is full of kind of busy and thinking

05:58.400 --> 06:03.760
and where do the preferences come from and how do people approach economics problems,

06:03.760 --> 06:08.800
how to actors, how to have agents behave and so on. So, you're in the world of cognitive

06:08.800 --> 06:16.880
science to some degree. Biology was really just because again, it's the topic of the era.

06:16.880 --> 06:21.680
And so, anybody who's living in this era who doesn't learn about molecular biology and

06:22.400 --> 06:27.600
the immune system and cancer and whatnot, I don't think it's quite living the full

06:27.600 --> 06:36.160
ethics life they could. Moreover, our field of data analysis and large scale data analysis,

06:36.160 --> 06:40.320
in particular, obviously, had a lot of connections to what was happening in biology and I wanted

06:40.320 --> 06:46.800
to kind of lend an ear and hear what was going on and see if I could contribute and that

06:46.800 --> 06:53.520
continues. So, I've learned a bit about proteins, I've learned a bit about how enzymes work

06:53.520 --> 07:00.000
and learn a bit about genomics and three-dimensional structure of genomics, something I'm currently

07:00.000 --> 07:06.160
interested in and these are just kind of, that's almost more of an intellectual hobby, but my main

07:06.160 --> 07:10.560
focus really is kind of learning algorithms and how they behave when you put them in real world

07:10.560 --> 07:14.320
deployments and how they behave when there's large collections of people involved and where all

07:14.320 --> 07:25.680
that's going. And you mentioned that one of your primary interests today is in the economic realm

07:25.680 --> 07:33.040
and how that interplays with inference and other things in the ML and AI world,

07:33.840 --> 07:38.960
elaborate a little bit on that. What's your thinking in direction there?

07:40.640 --> 07:48.400
Yeah, so I never was really an AI person in the sense that it was never the main thing in my

07:48.400 --> 07:55.520
life to have a computer replace a human being. That's kind of an interesting aspiration about

07:55.520 --> 08:02.640
could that be possible? I don't think it's impossible. I do believe it's possible. I don't believe

08:02.640 --> 08:09.280
it's going to happen in our lifetimes. Humans are just too amazingly rich, richly intelligent and

08:09.280 --> 08:14.640
deep and broad and so on. That said, it's a fantastically interesting philosophical question.

08:14.640 --> 08:21.920
But I was always more interested in more of the implications of algorithmic styles of thinking

08:21.920 --> 08:28.320
and what that meant if you put it out there in the world. In other words, there was a whole new

08:28.320 --> 08:33.600
infrastructure that links people like this network is linking us right now transmitting the bits.

08:33.600 --> 08:42.000
But what if it was more aware in some sense or what if the bits are given economic value so

08:42.000 --> 08:49.200
that we're actually some transactions are happening or that value is being recorded and created.

08:51.360 --> 08:55.600
What if there's kind of a market happening behind the scenes here?

08:57.200 --> 09:01.520
People are being connected in a way. What are the consequences of connecting all of us?

09:01.520 --> 09:04.960
But not just connecting humans. What are the consequences of all the connections behind the scenes?

09:05.760 --> 09:10.800
So if you think about just to be concrete like the current COVID, the coronavirus issues,

09:10.800 --> 09:15.520
we're all reading as much as we can about it. But behind the scenes, there's this vast network

09:15.520 --> 09:20.080
that involves doctors and people and researchers, but it also involves lots of data, lots of computers,

09:20.640 --> 09:25.200
lots of measurements and put it in all together and then how many it flow

09:26.080 --> 09:30.640
so just that the right ideas are present at the right time and the right decisions are being made

09:30.640 --> 09:38.560
for the right people is a non-trivial exercise. And it's not even being treated as an exercise

09:38.560 --> 09:42.640
usually. I think it's kind of all just ad hoc. We just do the best we can with what we got.

09:43.600 --> 09:48.160
But think about the banking system just as a point of comparison. Think about the ATMs

09:49.600 --> 09:53.280
that we all can now go around the world. This wasn't possible in my parents' generation.

09:53.280 --> 09:56.320
We can go around the world and have a little card. We don't even need a card anymore.

09:56.320 --> 10:02.800
Really, it's a cell phone. And our money is available to us anytime in any place and billions,

10:02.800 --> 10:05.680
I don't know, maybe trillions of transactions are happening per day and they're not and they're

10:05.680 --> 10:09.680
all correct. And even if the electricity goes out of the ATM machine, well I'm half with

10:09.680 --> 10:14.400
through my transaction, no problem. If I take out money here and my wife takes out money

10:14.400 --> 10:22.800
across the world, we don't get docked twice. So it's astonishing that it works and it really does.

10:24.320 --> 10:30.080
And there's huge consequences if it didn't work. Our financial system could be endangered.

10:30.080 --> 10:33.760
There's lots of criminals trying to make it not work and just all kinds of things like that.

10:33.760 --> 10:39.600
So it's not perfect, but it's sort of amazing and has had a big impact.

10:39.600 --> 10:43.280
And the current sort of medical response to COVID is nothing like that, right?

10:43.280 --> 10:48.800
It's an ad hoc collection of things where maybe some doctor read something somewhere

10:48.800 --> 10:54.480
and that triggered some thought. And that's fine. There's a lot of that going forward,

10:54.480 --> 11:02.400
but it also would be nice if we wouldn't have so much loss of human life and heartache if

11:02.400 --> 11:08.720
the right ideas were not kind of transmitted at the right times. And so looking back,

11:08.720 --> 11:13.520
that will be more and more possible. Just like looking back, when people started to first

11:13.520 --> 11:19.520
build electrical systems or chemical systems and factories and steam engines and all that,

11:19.520 --> 11:22.240
eventually they got it right and it really was great. And it just did a lot of the

11:22.240 --> 11:27.120
one things people. But along the way, it was really not great. And that's kind of where we are

11:27.120 --> 11:34.160
right now. We're creating all kinds of artifacts, including social networks that just looked fun,

11:34.160 --> 11:38.000
like fun. Let's just connect everybody up. It's easy, but it's turned out to not be so great.

11:38.000 --> 11:45.440
In many ways, it's pretty damaging the human spirit, really. And so a field that builds those

11:45.440 --> 11:51.440
systems should also be a field that's aware of the consequences of building that and able

11:51.440 --> 11:57.040
to kind of steer it and, you know, or at least, you know, be transparent about what could happen and

11:57.040 --> 12:00.560
let people avoid some of the bad consequences. We're not there.

12:02.240 --> 12:08.560
But there's so much in there. Can you maybe give us a few examples of when you're thinking about

12:08.560 --> 12:19.600
these large scale systems and applying kind of an economic lens to them? What are some of the

12:19.600 --> 12:26.640
you know, specific questions that that prompts for you and how you investigate those?

12:27.840 --> 12:32.240
Yeah. Yeah, let's listen to you be real concrete. I think that'll that'll really

12:33.360 --> 12:38.000
help the conversation help me to kind of wrap up the things more clearly as possible.

12:38.000 --> 12:42.720
So I'm my favorite example of these days, which if you've seen other podcasts with me,

12:42.720 --> 12:47.040
to the audience, my apologies, or this is you've heard it before, but it has it with music. And

12:47.040 --> 12:51.840
it has to do with kind of people who make music and people listen to music, right? And

12:52.720 --> 12:57.520
and I was lucky enough to meet someone named Steve Stout, who who's a friend and he's a

12:58.400 --> 13:05.120
an entrepreneur and he's also kind of been a music, you know, heavily involved in the music world.

13:05.120 --> 13:11.120
The recent music world, let's say hip hop and Latin music and so on and so forth. So I got

13:11.120 --> 13:15.600
to know him and he and I have kind of bounced thoughts back and forth. And so some of my thinking has

13:15.600 --> 13:20.720
been influenced by Steve. There's a company that he has that I have been on the board of advisors.

13:20.720 --> 13:26.880
It's called United Masters. And it has at latest, I think a few hundred thousand musicians

13:26.880 --> 13:31.360
signed up. All right. So what is going on there? What is why are musicians signing it to a company?

13:31.360 --> 13:40.800
Why do I find that interesting? Right. Well, music is a has economic value, right? And it should.

13:40.800 --> 13:45.520
Why should it have you gone to value? Well, because people who make music should be out of a living

13:45.520 --> 13:51.280
you know, have a job and be able to have a career, you know, making music. It shouldn't be doing

13:51.280 --> 14:00.080
it just for fun or just for, you know, you know, it's not a job. In fact, people talk a lot about

14:00.080 --> 14:04.480
missing job. So that's an example of something that shouldn't be a missing job. It should be a real

14:04.480 --> 14:13.280
job. Sadly, at that market, that ability to have a job in a world like creating music doesn't

14:13.280 --> 14:17.680
really exist. And this seems strange because there's studios all over the world. There's

14:17.680 --> 14:22.960
there's your music flows everywhere. It's it's a, you know, so surely there is a very healthy

14:23.760 --> 14:30.720
music market world. And the answer to the fact is there's not that there's a few people who

14:30.720 --> 14:35.760
still make, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars. They were plucked out. They have talent,

14:35.760 --> 14:40.400
but they were amplified then by a system that that that made them superstars.

14:40.400 --> 14:45.760
And you would think that, well, that's just how life is, that everyone wants to listen to the

14:45.760 --> 14:50.800
superstars. And they do listen to the superstars. And that's fine. And that's just, and then there's

14:50.800 --> 14:56.400
a lot of other people that make money in some, some penumbra. But you'd be wrong about that. No one,

14:56.400 --> 15:02.160
the fact is, if you look at the data that 95% of the music being listened to today was not made

15:02.160 --> 15:07.280
by the superstars. It was made by people you never heard of. And 95% of the music that's been

15:07.280 --> 15:12.320
listened to today was music done in the last two years. So these are kind of things that no one

15:12.320 --> 15:19.120
knows. But it suggests there's a whole missing market. So who is, who's making music and who's

15:19.120 --> 15:24.240
listening to it? Well, it's largely a cultural phenomenon. It's an intercity phenomenon. There's

15:24.240 --> 15:33.840
lots of kids who laugh off and then make music. And there means often good enough that,

15:33.840 --> 15:40.000
that they, you know, they stream it somewhere and it gets picked up on and they can actually

15:40.000 --> 15:44.320
become popular. Popular enough that a lot of people will listen to them. And then they're the

15:44.320 --> 15:50.320
cool people to listen to and that's who's actually listened to, you know, if you hang around younger

15:50.320 --> 15:56.960
people. Yeah. Yeah. So, so in that just all great, well, no, this is sad story because those

15:56.960 --> 16:01.040
kids who made that music, you know, within a year or two, they won't have a job, right? And they

16:01.040 --> 16:08.000
really, this is, so, so what can you do to fix that? So now, in some sense, the AI or data science

16:08.000 --> 16:13.440
comes into play, which is that every time someone's music is being streamed across these great networks

16:13.440 --> 16:19.520
that we've built, some economic value should accompany that. And I don't mean micropayments. I mean

16:20.240 --> 16:25.680
that if one of these kids is making a lot of music and, you know, hundreds of thousands of people,

16:25.680 --> 16:30.160
not even millions are listening to them, they should be able to see on a dashboard at the end of

16:30.160 --> 16:34.960
the week, who's listening to them? Where, where in the country? Here's a dot every time your music

16:34.960 --> 16:41.520
was listened to, all right? And if they turn out to be popular in a particular city, they should be

16:41.520 --> 16:45.600
able to tell the vineyarders and say, look, I'm popular there, let me come play in your city.

16:45.600 --> 16:50.000
And we'll, we'll broadcast to the audience because I'm connected to the audience, right? I have

16:50.000 --> 16:56.560
that data. And so the data is the currency of the realm here. The data says that I now know I'm

16:56.560 --> 17:01.280
popular and I can prove to you I'm popular. And so I'll come give a show there and I'll make,

17:01.280 --> 17:07.920
you know, $25,000. And if I do that three or four times a year, there's a salary right there.

17:08.960 --> 17:14.080
All right. More over if I start to get connected to my fans, I can offer them to come backstage.

17:14.080 --> 17:20.240
I can offer them to call, play your wedding for $20,000 or whatever. I can start to build a life

17:20.240 --> 17:25.200
and a career, right? And it's now not some company that's doing this for me or some agent.

17:25.200 --> 17:32.080
It's me. All right. I'm empowered to do this. All right. And I'm able to do this because of the

17:32.080 --> 17:37.040
data flow and people like me paying attention to what the data is and how to get into the hands of

17:37.040 --> 17:41.680
the people can act on it and helping to create a market where the producers are connected to the

17:41.680 --> 17:49.120
consumers. Okay. So this company United Masters is doing a good chunk of that equation, which is

17:49.120 --> 17:53.360
that it has signed up these young artists telling them don't sign with the record company,

17:53.360 --> 17:58.000
signed with us. And we will help you that we will be the data scientist for you. We'll let you

17:58.000 --> 18:04.800
have a record company in your pocket and we'll let you manage these things. Moreover, we will act

18:04.800 --> 18:09.600
as an agent for all of you. So if you, you know, the NBA website now, if you go there and listen

18:09.600 --> 18:14.960
to music there as you're watching the clips, it's these, it's these artists. So I get excited by

18:14.960 --> 18:19.920
that because I see that a little bit of AI and data science, the building of a producer consumer

18:19.920 --> 18:31.280
market paid into the long tail, the concern about the matching and the balancing, the use, you know,

18:31.280 --> 18:36.240
game theoretic and mark, you know, matching principles, along with recommendations to the

18:36.240 --> 18:42.560
principles, kind of all the guts of good machine learning systems. If you start to do that right,

18:42.560 --> 18:48.800
you can actually create this thing as a healthy market. And I can see it, you know, very soon

18:48.800 --> 18:54.080
within not just our lifetime, but the next year is kind of a million people in the U.S. being

18:54.080 --> 19:01.520
involved in such a market with us being listened to and able monetize it, you know, all such

19:01.520 --> 19:06.560
devices being sold around it and so on and so forth. And I can see not just in the U.S., I can see

19:06.560 --> 19:13.600
Brazil, you know, China, et cetera, each having their own music systems. And I can see companies

19:13.600 --> 19:20.480
emerging to support this. So in some cases, it all seems naive and easy and simple and why not,

19:20.480 --> 19:27.600
of course, but you know, it's not been what IT has done. IT has created like search engines

19:27.600 --> 19:34.240
or social networks, which are services that aim to, you know, provide connections among people.

19:35.120 --> 19:39.520
But no one, it doesn't actually preserve economic value or create new economic value.

19:39.520 --> 19:47.520
It just gives you data and then you have to monetize it with advertising. And so that's wrong.

19:47.520 --> 19:52.800
I mean, it's limited and it's not wrong. It's just limited. And if instead you say, no, my job

19:52.800 --> 19:59.040
as an IT person or AI person has created this system that is a real market and allows people to come

19:59.040 --> 20:03.840
in and they participate in the way they choose. And I'm just going to run the system and make sure

20:03.840 --> 20:08.720
that everybody gets connected up in the right way. And I'm going to do this at a brand new scale.

20:08.720 --> 20:15.440
It's not going to be 10 people or 100 or 1000. It's going to be millions. And in doing so,

20:15.440 --> 20:19.440
I'm like a real engineer. It's like a chemist who went from, you know, to take test tubes in the lab

20:19.440 --> 20:24.960
who could then build a factory and tell you that that thing is going to work. And so as a field,

20:24.960 --> 20:29.600
we started to orientals building that sort of thing, guarantee that it'll work, bringing in people,

20:30.960 --> 20:35.760
ensuring transparency, ensuring the working system. I'm thinking about how to do that. It's not

20:35.760 --> 20:42.080
trivial. You know, I think that that would be a really great chunk of labor for us. It would be

20:42.080 --> 20:45.440
something we would do that we'd be proud of, something that would actually make the world a better

20:45.440 --> 20:51.120
place. And that's just music. So we could go on and talk about other disciplines, you know,

20:51.120 --> 21:00.400
news or art or whatever, where our style of work, IT systems could create new ways for people

21:00.400 --> 21:03.680
to interact that actually give them value, that not just kind of hook them up and then I make

21:03.680 --> 21:08.240
money off of you by advertising. So I hope I give it enough of a flavor there that was kind of long,

21:08.240 --> 21:13.440
it was obviously very long-winded. But it's not that common to hear people think that way.

21:13.920 --> 21:19.040
It's more common to think, hey, I can build a company. I can use all this latest Gizmo stuff,

21:19.040 --> 21:24.240
you know, IT stuff. And people will be attracted and then I'll make money off of some way. I'll make

21:24.240 --> 21:30.880
it with advertising or whatever. Done. That's great. And then if I'm AI, I'm going to take all that

21:30.880 --> 21:34.960
data and I'm going to create super intelligence. I'll put that in there in the mix too and I'll

21:34.960 --> 21:40.080
even make more money. I don't know what people have in mind, really. But you know, the naive

21:40.080 --> 21:46.400
tale of all of that is breathtaking. And just a little bit of down to earth, hey, wait, isn't there

21:46.400 --> 21:50.640
a market here? Hey, can't we get some money in the hands of sixteen-year-olds or doing cool stuff?

21:50.640 --> 21:56.160
Hey, can't we rethink this whole equation of what the IT has been used for? I just don't hear

21:56.160 --> 22:00.320
it enough. And so I'm maybe willing to sort of say naive things about it, but just to say,

22:01.200 --> 22:05.680
a younger person, think about doing that. Create a company that creates a market that makes

22:05.680 --> 22:09.760
plenty of other people. You can take your little commission. That's great. That's a wonderful

22:09.760 --> 22:14.320
thing to aspire to. And if you're an academic, think about, hey, how could I actually create a

22:14.320 --> 22:19.760
market with millions of people or hundreds of millions of people that actually works? You know,

22:19.760 --> 22:23.360
that isn't attackable or it doesn't collapse at a heat. You know, how could I do that?

22:23.360 --> 22:32.080
And is the core element of interest in there, the idea of a marketplace? You know, whether it's

22:32.080 --> 22:40.080
two-sided or multi-sided, is that what is driving a lot of your interest? And I add on to that

22:40.080 --> 22:46.320
a little bit. One of the things that is really interesting about your work and some of your

22:46.320 --> 22:57.600
writings is that you often come back to this idea of planetary scale. And one of the best examples

22:57.600 --> 23:05.600
we have of that is the internet. And we referenced that a little bit earlier, the bits flying around.

23:07.120 --> 23:15.120
But you don't think of that as a marketplace necessarily. It's this undifferentiated

23:15.120 --> 23:20.240
infrastructure that was made available that we figured out all these incredible things to do with.

23:21.840 --> 23:28.880
So do you think this idea of a marketplace is kind of a next frontier in some way or

23:29.840 --> 23:37.280
is that just an example of one of these planetary scale systems that you think is interesting?

23:38.000 --> 23:41.680
Yeah, that's a great question. First of all, I don't necessarily love the word marketplace.

23:41.680 --> 23:46.800
But I find that when I use that terminology, a lot of people argue with me. So I must be on to

23:46.800 --> 23:54.160
something. Yeah, I must be on to something. So, you know, it's odd. If I talk about grading

23:54.160 --> 24:02.640
and descent or learning or AI, the market starts to get, wait, even markets respond for all of these

24:02.640 --> 24:09.520
social ills. These are the markets for respect. So I give a talk in an academic conference about a

24:09.520 --> 24:14.960
year ago. It's just totally technical geeky kind of people wanting to see the latest equations.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.720
At the end of it, I mentioned the word market. They said, well, markets are terrible,

24:18.720 --> 24:23.280
aren't they? And I said, really? And he said, yeah, it's sort of, he said, it's responsible for

24:23.280 --> 24:28.480
global warming. And, you know, so it's like, okay, we need to step back a moment here to get

24:28.480 --> 24:35.840
a deep breath. You know, so markets were created by academics or by powerful people. It was created,

24:35.840 --> 24:40.160
you know, somehow by human interactions, thousands of years ago. And it's like, you have a little

24:40.160 --> 24:45.600
something, I have a little something, hey, we could trade, we both be happier. And so it's a kind of

24:45.600 --> 24:51.200
an enforcement nature. It doesn't mean that it's like it solves all problems or that it's a good

24:51.200 --> 24:58.560
force of nature or good or bad. It's just there. It is there. It's been under exploited in our field.

24:58.560 --> 25:03.360
So, you know, the internet, no, I don't think it is a market, right? The internet was kind of

25:03.360 --> 25:11.760
human attempt to have no scarcity, constant availability, you know, no limits, right? And that's not

25:11.760 --> 25:18.160
real life, right? Real life is about limits and about scarcity and about trade-offs. I can't do

25:18.160 --> 25:21.760
this because you're wanting to do this or I can't do this because I got limits on my time or I'm

25:21.760 --> 25:26.640
like, you know, that's real life. The mature human being is able to manage these kind of, you know,

25:26.640 --> 25:30.480
trade-offs. They can't do everything they want to do. And the internet was something about, no,

25:30.480 --> 25:34.240
no trade-offs, folks. You give these much bits and bandwidth as you want. And let's just keep

25:34.240 --> 25:39.200
working and working and working until that's true, right? And that's somehow just not real. And it

25:39.200 --> 25:44.320
had to kind of eventually lead to some sort of, you know, effectively chaos. And there's a bit of

25:44.320 --> 25:48.720
stage. We have a lot of social chaos right now driven by that way of thinking that it's all fine.

25:49.920 --> 25:54.240
So markets are actually kind of more of a constraint, which is that, hey, you're in the game,

25:54.240 --> 25:57.280
I'm in the game too. We keep all kind of what you want, but maybe we'll find a way that we're both

25:57.280 --> 26:04.720
a little bit happy, right? So another way I like to say it is that you don't like markets. Well,

26:04.720 --> 26:08.560
you know, suppose I'm trying to do a form of engineering, I'm trying to do a mechanical engineering.

26:09.840 --> 26:13.520
You know, I know little physics and I know a little fluid flow or something. And now I'm trying

26:13.520 --> 26:17.760
to create this new field where I build buildings and bridges or whatever. And I'm going to have

26:17.760 --> 26:22.560
principles for that, you know, based on basic physics, all right? And now the question is, do I

26:22.560 --> 26:27.920
should I use gravity or not in my new field? You know, well, I can say, well, gravity, sure,

26:27.920 --> 26:31.200
I can use gravity as part of physics, right? I have to use it. And someone said, well, no,

26:31.200 --> 26:36.000
but gravity is a terrible thing. What does gravity do? How many people die a year from gravity?

26:37.120 --> 26:42.160
Well, you know, lots. People fall down and hurt themselves in all kinds of ways because of gravity.

26:42.720 --> 26:46.160
Right? And so, you know, gravity should be avoided at all costs. It's really evil.

26:46.960 --> 26:51.280
All right? So that's a stupid way to think, right? And the right thing way to think about it is

26:51.280 --> 26:57.040
that gravity is just a force of nature. We can use it and we should. But we should also control it

26:57.040 --> 27:01.040
and be aware of the consequences and all that. So same thing with markets. It's a force of nature.

27:01.040 --> 27:09.040
You know, turning it off is a bad idea. So, but use it, but then be aware of what the consequences are.

27:09.040 --> 27:13.520
And more of our markets, you know, gravity is kind of one thing. Maybe it's not a lot of physicists,

27:13.520 --> 27:19.120
but markets aren't one thing. So there's matching markets. There's auctions. There's just all kinds

27:19.120 --> 27:24.880
already in economics. As we go forward with learning systems invading into microeconomics,

27:25.520 --> 27:30.480
you know, brand new kinds of markets go up to emerge. You know, so like, you know, second price

27:30.480 --> 27:35.280
auction markets, that was a discovery just now, you know, in our lifetime. And there's just to be

27:35.280 --> 27:39.200
all kinds of new mechanisms like that that need to be discovered to make these markets actually

27:39.200 --> 27:43.840
safe and interesting and healthy and work at the scales we need to work at and all that. And that's

27:43.840 --> 27:49.920
an emerging field. And so yeah, we're just saying markets and we're done. That solves a problem.

27:49.920 --> 27:57.200
No, but markets as a way just to bring in more constraints into your problem, make it a little more

27:57.200 --> 28:05.280
social and hint at all the challenges and then try to knock them off. Yeah, I'm very enamored

28:05.280 --> 28:09.600
with that way of thinking. So no, the internet's gone market. The internet was just kind of a pipe.

28:09.600 --> 28:14.160
That's fine. But I think we're going to be a much more mature feel when we start to at least have

28:14.160 --> 28:22.480
a little bit of appreciation for the word market. You're when you when you in the example that you

28:22.480 --> 28:31.440
gave with the the music company, one of the key themes there was this idea of empowerment.

28:32.400 --> 28:36.640
But I think, you know, just kind of following along on this markets thread, you know,

28:36.640 --> 28:45.760
we've also seen examples of, you know, markets. You know, and I'm thinking of, you know,

28:46.720 --> 28:53.280
not to name a certain four-letter ride sharing company, but, you know, using their market power to,

28:54.880 --> 29:00.800
you know, ultimately allegedly take advantage of, you know, gig economy workers.

29:00.800 --> 29:10.400
I'm curious. I guess maybe the question, you know, there is, you know, do you think government

29:10.400 --> 29:16.560
regulation is a kind of a necessary component of markets or do you believe that, you know,

29:16.560 --> 29:21.600
something else? Oh, yeah, no, I totally believe that government regulation is needed.

29:23.200 --> 29:29.840
Yeah, so I know enough economists to know too that most of them agree that there was a

29:29.840 --> 29:33.120
thing we call the Chicago School where unregulated markets were going to solve all the

29:33.120 --> 29:37.360
most problems. And that's just that's just not not true. Yeah, not, you know, empirically.

29:38.240 --> 29:42.240
And I think as we develop these brand new kinds of markets that are operating scales kind of

29:42.240 --> 29:47.600
beyond the human capacity faster than we ever could think or bigger than we could ever consume,

29:47.600 --> 29:53.280
conceive of, that it's not going to be just the kind of working it out at the local level kind

29:53.280 --> 29:58.000
of that humans will fight with each other. And if you cheated me, I'll come find you, you know,

29:58.000 --> 30:02.880
well, it's not, it's so we need, we need, yeah, there's, we need many hierarchies of structures

30:02.880 --> 30:08.080
that are starting from the local to the more global. And we're going to have to work out in tandem

30:08.960 --> 30:14.160
as we develop these learning systems and these data-oriented systems that help us make decisions

30:14.160 --> 30:18.480
that are in the world, whatever you want to call it, it's happening. And so I think taking

30:18.480 --> 30:23.520
in a mature market perspective will help, but then working with lawyers, legal people, working

30:23.520 --> 30:29.200
with social, just working with people who are public policy people and trying to figure out what are

30:29.200 --> 30:33.920
the appropriate ways to regulate here so that we do the right thing. Economics also has a beautiful,

30:33.920 --> 30:39.120
it's kind of a dour field, right? It has this kind of, hey, I think I'm doing the right thing by

30:39.120 --> 30:44.240
putting in this mechanism, but the consequences of that are that, you know, incentivizes somebody

30:44.240 --> 30:49.440
to come in and do something that breaks entirely what I do. Well, you know, economists are pretty

30:49.440 --> 30:53.360
good at now thinking that through all the way to the end and sort of seem, well, okay, that didn't

30:53.360 --> 30:57.600
work, but here's another way to do it. And I think, again, if we partner and we kind of work

30:58.960 --> 31:04.240
with that style of thinking that it'll help us to understand what kind of ways to structure these

31:04.240 --> 31:10.320
markets. Also, this field of mechanism design is very kind of, it's probably the field part of

31:10.320 --> 31:14.640
economics closest to computer science where you start to get the constraints and the algorithms

31:14.640 --> 31:19.760
of computer science. And it's not just open and open, it's a market and it works. It's no, that

31:19.760 --> 31:23.920
gives you, that's like gravity, that gives you a lot of the force, the basic oomph there.

31:24.960 --> 31:28.560
But on top of that, you got to put various, these kind of constraints, you got to run the auction

31:28.560 --> 31:33.680
in this kind of way, you got to go up and down and so on and so forth, such that it'll actually kind

31:33.680 --> 31:38.480
of give the socially desirable outcome that all of us aspire to. Now, if you add learning systems

31:38.480 --> 31:42.400
on top of that, we're all kind of putting in our data and it's learning from us and we're learning

31:42.400 --> 31:49.040
from them, it just becomes much more rich and complicated. And so, yeah, definitely, I'm

31:49.040 --> 31:53.360
very much on the side of some regulation and it's kind of the right mix. If you try to do it all

31:53.360 --> 31:58.080
top down, it's going to totally not work. The kind of free market people were right about that.

31:59.440 --> 32:02.880
Think about another kind of market just to be kind, so you could help your think is, I don't think,

32:02.880 --> 32:09.200
is the suppose that I'm trying to build an app that gets people to the airport as quickly as

32:09.200 --> 32:17.040
possible. We already have apps kind of like that. So, it records some data and it figures out

32:17.040 --> 32:22.640
that a certain path from here to A to B is like the fastest based on the data. That's great.

32:22.640 --> 32:26.160
So, now it recommends, if I'm an A, if I don't want to get to B, it'll recommend a certain path to

32:26.160 --> 32:32.000
me. And if only me is using the app than great or for a few people are using it fine, but what

32:32.000 --> 32:36.960
if everyone in the city is using it? Now, it'll send everybody from A to B and creates congestion.

32:36.960 --> 32:40.880
All right. There's an economic phenomenon. There's scarcity that's not being respected.

32:40.880 --> 32:46.400
All right. So, at that point, you could say, well, okay, I screwed it up. It's my job to figure out

32:46.400 --> 32:51.200
how to do the blow balancing. I shouldn't be sending everyone A to B. So, who do I send from A

32:51.200 --> 32:57.760
through C to B instead and do the slower path? Well, that becomes hard to know, you know. Maybe,

32:57.760 --> 33:03.760
I think I know you're a impatient kind of person. So, I'll send you down the fast route or you're

33:03.760 --> 33:08.800
in a patient kind of person. You can see all the trouble I'm going to get into. Rather, at that point,

33:08.800 --> 33:15.680
you got to sort of abandon the pure top down, you know, regulation oriented computer science person

33:15.680 --> 33:19.680
and be the more open markets person. You say, well, I'm going to give it as an option to people. They

33:19.680 --> 33:23.200
can pay a little bit more. Maybe to go down the street that's fast because they know they're in a

33:23.200 --> 33:28.320
hurry today. And they're willing to part with a little of their money or they're today. Actually,

33:28.320 --> 33:32.960
they're not subject to hurry. They'll save some money for the future. So, add some auction mechanism

33:32.960 --> 33:37.040
in there and do it in a clever way. So, they don't actually have to run an auction as you're trying

33:37.040 --> 33:43.200
to figure out how to get to the airport. But have an avatar running an auction for you. And now,

33:43.200 --> 33:46.720
you can imagine that, you know, people go on the road that they're most, you know, that helps

33:46.720 --> 33:52.720
some of the utility. They get there quickly enough for their purposes. So, now we've kind of created

33:53.360 --> 34:01.440
economic style, you know, information flow kind of system that maybe some experience about us,

34:01.440 --> 34:05.440
but also uses our in the moment kind of knowledge that we're looking for and creates a system that

34:05.440 --> 34:11.040
overall would maybe make people happier. We wouldn't make only the rich get richer or create

34:11.040 --> 34:16.960
congestion because we're doing it being stupid. Yeah, what was really interesting in that example for

34:16.960 --> 34:28.000
me is that you layer on this idea that, you know, the future will have these kind of marketplaces

34:28.000 --> 34:33.360
that you're describing and the marketplaces will have, you know, built-in, you know, learning systems

34:33.360 --> 34:41.120
and intelligences. But the players as well will have, you know, learning systems in a form of agents

34:41.120 --> 34:48.160
or whatever. If we layer that into your example, you know, even today, you can, you know, open up your

34:48.160 --> 34:52.640
phone and it'll tell you, oh, it's time to leave to the, you know, to go to the airport because you

34:52.640 --> 34:58.160
have a flight at, you know, whatever time. You know, those algorithms, I think are, you know,

34:58.160 --> 35:06.000
based on, you know, kind of map style algorithms. But you can easily imagine, you know, these

35:06.000 --> 35:11.440
interactions between the, you know, optimization that's happening in the market and the optimization

35:11.440 --> 35:16.000
that's happening, you know, with your agent that's representing your interests and trying to

35:16.000 --> 35:27.600
either, you know, save you time or gas money or whatever it is. And in the fields of economics

35:27.600 --> 35:37.120
and, you know, game theory, there's all kinds of research into interacting systems and how they

35:37.120 --> 35:43.120
behave and, you know, what is overall equilibrium, things like that. When I think about, you know,

35:43.120 --> 35:48.560
kind of bringing it back to ML and AI, I've started to think about things like adversarial

35:48.560 --> 35:53.440
relationships, which were studying. Are there other examples of, you know, where we're studying

35:53.440 --> 36:00.800
these and interacting learning systems at this scale? Yeah, we're not studying enough. There

36:00.800 --> 36:06.080
are a lot of people, there's a, there's a community called EC, economics and computation that

36:06.080 --> 36:10.000
there's a conference is devoted to it. And it's sort of not in the central of, you know, a lot of

36:10.000 --> 36:14.080
machine learning people don't know about it. And I'm even given the wrong actual, the, the

36:14.080 --> 36:19.200
acronym is EC, but I think it's economics in computation or and computation. But anyway,

36:19.840 --> 36:24.240
it's, it's, it's, it's, people who study really kind of algorithmic beats economics. And there's

36:24.240 --> 36:28.240
not that much learning there, but there's, there's, there's some people, the, the few people

36:28.240 --> 36:35.120
the world who do study those things are often found there. And, you know, you can, there's things

36:35.120 --> 36:40.400
like what if I have many, many actions like in a classical game theoretic setting and there's

36:40.400 --> 36:46.640
like two actions or 10 or there's not hundreds of thousands. But in our world, there's often

36:46.640 --> 36:49.840
hundreds of thousands, all the treatments I could have for some, you know, medical condition

36:49.840 --> 36:53.680
or all the paths I could take to the airport or all the restaurants I could go to and check

36:53.680 --> 36:59.520
high, you know, et cetera, et cetera, all the books I could read. All right. So, so classical

36:59.520 --> 37:03.600
game three doesn't have a lot of kind of 100,000 by 100,000, you know, or a million by million

37:03.600 --> 37:07.760
game tables. If they had those, they would have realized there's no way I'm going to know the

37:07.760 --> 37:12.080
numbers in that game table. All right. And so, that's where we come into the picture, which is

37:12.080 --> 37:17.280
that we're telling you how from day to day get numbers like that. All right. And, but now we can

37:17.280 --> 37:21.120
do things like, well, I can't explore all those numbers. I can't try every restaurant. I can't

37:21.120 --> 37:26.080
try to be Patrick or, but, but you try it and you're my friend. All right. And so like recommendation

37:26.080 --> 37:32.400
systems are explicitly about that is that as a community, we try a bunch of options. And then

37:32.400 --> 37:36.720
somehow the algorithms figure out a way to make recommendations that would fill in entries in

37:36.720 --> 37:42.080
the table, even though we never experienced them before. And also, there's kind of an exploration

37:42.080 --> 37:47.680
exploitation idea in learning and statistics, which is really, really critical, which is, you know,

37:49.040 --> 37:54.000
there's many options I have to try today, you know, things I could try to do. Some of them,

37:54.000 --> 37:59.680
I try because they give me a reward, you know, I had a nice dinner and so on. Some of them,

37:59.680 --> 38:04.560
I try because I want to explore and because maybe for the future, I want to do that instead. And,

38:04.560 --> 38:08.320
and life is kind of a mixture of these things. And so good machine learning people are aware and

38:08.320 --> 38:12.560
kind of no algorithms for trying to mix these things. It's not that common in other fields. A lot of

38:12.560 --> 38:18.560
other fields are either pure explorers, pure, pure exploit. So you can now think about kind of

38:18.560 --> 38:24.480
economic systems where, you know, I'm trying to get to the airport, but, you know, maybe I'm like in

38:24.480 --> 38:29.440
Italy and I'm kind of just happy to also see this countryside a little bit, you know. I'm more

38:29.440 --> 38:34.640
in an explorer mode. And so since I'm going to explore me, you know, maybe the system, you know,

38:34.640 --> 38:39.760
the avatar, whatever, we'll kind of know that. And it'll kind of, you know, give me a different

38:39.760 --> 38:44.400
experience than I might otherwise had. It's not just trying to optimize in a really dumb way.

38:46.240 --> 38:52.000
You know, or I'm going to the shopping mall, right? And nowadays there aren't really many shopping

38:52.000 --> 38:57.600
malls. But, you know, you can imagine that or I go to a commerce site. Sometimes I really just

38:57.600 --> 39:04.000
want to go there and buy two paces from what I want. And I want just very little, you know,

39:04.000 --> 39:08.880
in my way between me and the acquisition, right? But other times I go there and I want to learn

39:08.880 --> 39:12.480
what's the coolest thing out there. I want to have a social interaction. I want to sort of

39:12.480 --> 39:18.880
entertain and so on and so forth. And so if our virtual world, you know, our avatar driven virtual

39:18.880 --> 39:23.280
world was a little bit more like that. That it recognized that now you're an explorer,

39:23.280 --> 39:29.280
mowing, now you're an exploit mode. And then, you know, structure your interactions and structure

39:29.280 --> 39:34.160
the environment around you would reflect all that. You know, that would be healthy. And it wouldn't,

39:34.160 --> 39:38.800
it wouldn't need to know all the details about my life to do that. It wouldn't be in basic.

39:38.800 --> 39:42.960
It would really more be, as you said earlier, like the word empowered. It would allow me to sort

39:42.960 --> 39:47.040
of give a little bit of information such that it was structured the environment in a way that I

39:47.040 --> 39:52.960
would find more appropriate for my current needs. I think that the IT Silicon Valley world

39:52.960 --> 39:56.880
was very too much top-down. They thought they could build the system and it would be perfect

39:56.880 --> 40:00.080
and it would know everything about you. And if it didn't know enough about you,

40:00.080 --> 40:04.320
it would look even more into your browsing history. And it would bring together all the information

40:04.320 --> 40:08.240
and so much so that it would know what you would want and it would anticipate your every need.

40:08.240 --> 40:12.560
And that style of thinking is, you know, God damn it, it's still too much there. You know,

40:12.560 --> 40:15.920
they want this little secretary sitting next to you that no anticipates your every need. That's a

40:15.920 --> 40:21.520
dream of AI. Well, I don't dream of having that secretary myself at all. You know,

40:21.520 --> 40:30.800
I dream of really having a few aspects of my state kind of taken respected and my utilities

40:30.800 --> 40:36.880
and my preferences. And I want you to take some load off of me, but I don't want to anticipate

40:36.880 --> 40:41.680
my every need because you cannot. And the idea that a company would be able to do that is both

40:41.680 --> 40:46.880
frightening and unrealistic. And so, yeah, this kind of idea back off from that, folks,

40:46.880 --> 40:51.280
creates something more like a little bit of a market where I go into a market here in

40:51.280 --> 40:56.560
Italy, you know, it's people are trying to sell things to me, but they're not like they know

40:56.560 --> 41:04.560
me that much. They're just giving me opportunities. And so our own world, I think, is

41:04.560 --> 41:15.760
more like that. And on that is that a statement about, you know, first and foremost about kind of

41:15.760 --> 41:24.640
the centralization of data and or the centralization of, you know, intelligence or

41:26.720 --> 41:37.040
or is it about, you know, you just you don't have any interest in the, you know, technology

41:39.520 --> 41:42.720
being available to kind of enhance your life in that way.

41:42.720 --> 41:48.480
Hey, you're that's a great question. You're heading in a direction I have less to say about,

41:48.480 --> 41:53.600
but I'm very, very important. Who knows who has the data and who has the power because they have

41:53.600 --> 41:59.520
that. And those are critical issues. Because I'm here and you say you'd love for this thing to,

41:59.520 --> 42:05.920
you know, get you on the scenic route in Italy and, you know, you, you know, serendipitously maybe,

42:05.920 --> 42:10.480
oh, you know, you're passing by this amazing thing. If you stop for 15 minutes, you'd have the time

42:10.480 --> 42:18.160
of your life. And kind of hinting at, you know, maybe more of the misgivings are the way that we're

42:18.160 --> 42:25.760
currently creating those experiences. Yeah, no, I don't feel empowered by such a system. I feel

42:25.760 --> 42:30.560
bothered by such a system. And so I need to feel empowered. And there is a difference. And so this

42:30.560 --> 42:39.920
word power does matter to me. You know, so whether it's centralized or whatever, if you use my data,

42:41.600 --> 42:46.640
then that's okay with me, but if it's some sense, you use it and I get value out of your using it.

42:47.920 --> 42:57.440
So if you pay me in some sense for my data. So in particular, you know, a travel agent is a person

42:57.440 --> 43:02.640
who makes travel plans for lots of people. And they get better and better and better over the years,

43:02.640 --> 43:06.160
right? So when I walk into that travel agent, they're just really good at it. They know how to get

43:06.160 --> 43:09.760
me from point A to point me in a great way. Well, why? Because they got you to that point, you know,

43:09.760 --> 43:14.960
they had experience in the past. So all your data is being used to help me. And are you unhappy about

43:14.960 --> 43:19.840
that? Well, no, that's what a travel agent does. They kind of take that data. And so a system that

43:19.840 --> 43:26.960
does that that kind of, you know, somewhere, some partially, you know, anonymizes me, but that builds

43:26.960 --> 43:30.640
up experience dealing with people like me. And then I kind of know what I'm getting. You know,

43:30.640 --> 43:34.640
this travel agent doesn't need to know everything, but they they took away enough to help somebody

43:34.640 --> 43:39.600
else. I'm good with that. The medical system, you treat me, it works for me. I want it to be

43:39.600 --> 43:47.840
well for you tomorrow, right? I don't want to protect that data. So, you know, I do want data to

43:47.840 --> 43:51.760
flow. And I do want it to quote unquote, be centralized. But I don't want it to be used as an

43:51.760 --> 43:56.240
advertising model that you have a lot of data about me. Therefore, you can tell other people the

43:56.240 --> 44:04.560
advertisers how to come find me, right? That doesn't empower me to help me help you. But for humans to

44:04.560 --> 44:09.520
help each other via the data flows. And for a company to help provide that and then even take

44:09.520 --> 44:15.600
a bit of a cut, that's all that's more more in my that's more my comfort zone. So I would yeah,

44:15.600 --> 44:20.400
definitely not a, you know, all on or all off here, you know, it's always in the middle. It's

44:20.400 --> 44:24.000
know that it's not that there should be no, you know, data collections and centralization,

44:24.000 --> 44:27.760
because that, you know, prevents you from actually having nice flows that are helpful to people.

44:29.680 --> 44:34.800
You know, but, but also not just you can take my data willingly. You know, it's got to be kind of

44:34.800 --> 44:39.840
a valuation of data. There's got to be that you pay me in some sense for data. And that I'm kind

44:39.840 --> 44:46.800
of okay with that equation. So I go into your system. So if I go to a city and I'm, it's a restaurant

44:46.800 --> 44:52.400
application is trying to give me recommendations of where to go. You know, if I'm in a foreign

44:52.400 --> 44:55.840
city and I don't speak the language and it's seven o'clock and I'm hungry, I really would like

44:55.840 --> 45:00.720
something really, really good that knows enough about me and the environment and all that,

45:00.720 --> 45:04.800
they can really put me in a good place to eat that it's not, you know, weird or scary or whatever.

45:04.800 --> 45:09.120
And I'm willing to give up a little bit of privacy for that about my past or about where I am at

45:09.120 --> 45:15.120
all, but not too much, right? And there needs to be a way to find that, you know, and so I think

45:15.120 --> 45:19.520
that's again, somewhat economic here. There's a tradeoff being implemented there. There's a trade

45:19.520 --> 45:26.080
off between my privacy and the value I will get out of being, you know, you know, being helped with

45:26.080 --> 45:34.560
my decision that was otherwise extremely, extremely hard. The travel agent example is a really

45:34.560 --> 45:43.920
interesting one to me. I'm guessing that probably the vast, vast majority of our listening

45:43.920 --> 45:53.760
audience has never used a travel agent. And, you know, probably only those of us who have can

45:53.760 --> 45:59.520
appreciate what a good travel agent really brings to the table. And it makes me think that we think

45:59.520 --> 46:05.600
about this idea of, you know, we think about AI in the context of this digital divide and,

46:06.400 --> 46:11.440
you know, there will be, you know, communities that will be left behind because they don't have

46:12.640 --> 46:22.160
ready access to, you know, AI technology. But the travel agent example makes me think that,

46:22.160 --> 46:30.640
in a lot of ways, it's like a human divide, in a sense, in that that we need to worry about. And

46:31.360 --> 46:40.240
that the, you know, the knowledge of, you know, humans is going to be, you know, is going to be

46:40.240 --> 46:46.320
commoditized into these computational systems like AI's. And, you know, only the select few will

46:46.320 --> 46:52.080
have access to, you know, actual humans who know things and have experiences and can,

46:54.800 --> 46:59.760
can help them in, you know, whatever the endeavor is. Travel agent is a great example of that.

47:01.200 --> 47:05.920
You know, it gets really scary if it's, you know, in medicine, for example, where, you know,

47:05.920 --> 47:11.120
the masses are being treated by kind of the commoditized robot doctors, but, you know,

47:11.120 --> 47:16.560
only the select few can actually speak to a human doctor with real experience. Do you, do you see

47:17.360 --> 47:21.680
that as a direction? Do you think economics plays into that? Is that something you worry about?

47:23.360 --> 47:28.320
Yeah, those are, I do worry about all of that. I think it's those are very critical problems.

47:28.320 --> 47:32.080
Again, it's not enough just for someone like me to worry about it. It's got to be a joint effort

47:32.080 --> 47:38.000
of lots, lots of people, you know, but indeed bringing in all the right people and making sure

47:38.000 --> 47:44.320
there's a full, throated, diverse collection of people, you know, backgrounds and interests and

47:44.320 --> 47:48.800
all that, associate with the role of these things is so important, critically important.

47:50.640 --> 47:56.480
And so, you know, maybe a little bit on the optimism side, a lot of the things that I think

47:56.480 --> 48:02.000
are interesting about my own life are kind of contextual and local. And the knowledge that's

48:02.000 --> 48:06.240
available there is not something that Google's going to have. Most of the things about my life

48:06.240 --> 48:10.080
that are interesting and all the Google doesn't know anything even to this day about, you know, my

48:10.080 --> 48:15.840
searching browsing pattern is pretty limited and uninteresting. And I click on all kinds of junk.

48:15.840 --> 48:20.240
I clicked on something the other day about, you know, the Queen of England or whatever.

48:20.240 --> 48:24.400
It's just because I just was lazy and I just clicked on this. I know it's just in that whatsoever.

48:25.920 --> 48:30.720
And, you know, there's tons of really noisy messy data in places like that that is kind of

48:30.720 --> 48:36.800
irrelevant within, you know, 30 microseconds, not to mention two years. All right, so most of us

48:36.800 --> 48:41.280
have a little more local environment around us that we help to construct and we participate in

48:41.280 --> 48:48.880
a little more like a village rather than a, and by making and having that not being excluded

48:48.880 --> 48:54.960
from that and having that be, you know, a healthy, good place, I'm a little less worried about

48:54.960 --> 48:59.680
that there's going to be extreme stratification of, you know, this kind of technology.

48:59.680 --> 49:06.400
Also AI for the most clear, this is data analysis, really. It's not magic.

49:06.400 --> 49:10.160
These are ideas that are totally open and available to, you know, are on the archive.

49:10.160 --> 49:14.160
They're simple algorithms. There is no mystery. People all over the world know what grading

49:14.160 --> 49:19.680
is sent is and so and so forth. So moreover, computers are pretty much a commodity nowadays.

49:20.240 --> 49:25.600
And the data, again, it's very contextual. The data relevant for some situation in Brazil is not

49:25.600 --> 49:30.720
the data that's relevant for, you know, Palo Alto. And so it's not the Palo Alto bit of going to take

49:30.720 --> 49:35.440
over because they have all the, you know, the goods. And then the people trained to solve the

49:35.440 --> 49:41.120
problems are all local too. So I still think our local community building and our cultures and

49:41.120 --> 49:45.280
all that are going to be, you know, critically important as we go forward. But there shouldn't be

49:45.280 --> 49:50.880
kind of, you know, fiefdoms and, you know, enclaves, you know, there should be a let, you know,

49:50.880 --> 49:55.600
and so it's going to require, you know, all the right kind of people to be involved in the construction

49:55.600 --> 50:01.760
of as we build. So the medical one is a good example, you know, COVID has definitely decimated

50:01.760 --> 50:06.640
minority communities more than it has decimated, you know, rich and white communities.

50:06.640 --> 50:12.560
And this is a great example of that, hey, shouldn't that be like, oh, you know, why should there be

50:12.560 --> 50:18.240
a racial discrepancy there? You know, it's a, it's a goddamn virus. Well, there is because that

50:18.240 --> 50:22.880
reflects all of our ways of our systems have been built and have been built at Hawk and have built

50:22.880 --> 50:27.840
without thinking about that. And those have got to be knocked down and broke and thought through

50:27.840 --> 50:31.920
and make sure that those kind of things are, you know, mitigated and don't happen.

50:34.000 --> 50:39.120
Yeah, so very, very important issues. And I just think mostly it's less about, you know,

50:39.120 --> 50:43.520
those of us who think about the mathematics and the systems kind of doing it all right, it's,

50:43.520 --> 50:47.200
but, but ensure that all the right people are in the room when the, when the systems get,

50:47.200 --> 50:52.160
get built and when, and then it's transparent all the way through. There's never kind of a black

50:52.160 --> 50:59.680
box that the society can't look at. So we've been kind of going with the flow of this conversation

50:59.680 --> 51:10.000
and it's been wonderful. And I do want to kind of touch on a ML specific question, but even before

51:10.000 --> 51:16.080
we get to that, one of the things that is, you know, just very clear and chatting with you is that,

51:16.080 --> 51:21.440
you know, you have tons of ideas and you're currently exploring, you know, kind of this intersection

51:21.440 --> 51:30.160
of economics and, and machine learning and marketplaces and, you know, you've, again, we've,

51:30.160 --> 51:35.440
you've worked in biology and other fields. I'm just curious, you know, and getting a little meta

51:35.440 --> 51:42.720
here, your, you know, process or philosophy and kind of wrangling these ideas and turning them

51:42.720 --> 51:49.200
into, you know, interesting or even award-winning research, you know, or economic endeavors.

51:51.280 --> 51:58.400
Yeah, thanks for asking. Let me just sort of say to me, that's a question that's more about talking

51:58.400 --> 52:01.760
about younger researchers, how they could kind of get it in this field. Really, that's what comes

52:01.760 --> 52:06.160
to me because I don't think I have any major secrets myself. I wouldn't look at my own career or

52:06.160 --> 52:11.040
my own way of approaching things and say, wow, there's, I figured it out. Well, I didn't, you know,

52:11.040 --> 52:17.040
and so part of it is I've been doing it for a long time. But, you know, secondly, I think that,

52:18.480 --> 52:23.920
that most of the challenge is if you start to realize what a real challenge is, one that

52:23.920 --> 52:28.880
will make a difference, that impacts or at least touches on issues that people care about,

52:30.880 --> 52:38.080
that, you know, is worth kind of a two or three years of your time. Those are the kind of ones I

52:38.080 --> 52:43.280
go after. If it's going to be like a month of my time, I'm not particularly interested in it,

52:43.280 --> 52:47.040
and if it's going to be hopeless, you know, like, you know, Fermat's last equations, I just

52:47.760 --> 52:51.600
know either, right? So I've kind of find these ones at two or three years of my time. So I get up

52:51.600 --> 52:55.920
every morning and I make a little progress on it. And I just, especially for young people, just

52:55.920 --> 53:02.000
sort of each one of you is smart enough to work in this field, each one of you knows enough. And so,

53:02.000 --> 53:07.040
you know, but make sure you pick a problem. That is kind of meaty and it feels like it's not obvious

53:07.040 --> 53:10.960
and it's not what everybody else is working on. It's kind of got your own flavor to it.

53:10.960 --> 53:14.480
And it feels like after two or three years, you should be able to make some progress on it.

53:15.280 --> 53:19.120
And then just keep getting up and hacking at it every day. And if you get a little frustrated,

53:19.120 --> 53:24.640
pull back for a while. But that said, every day, I like to say that half of my day is devoted to

53:24.640 --> 53:30.320
just kind of exploration. I read books on stuff. I think about, you know, I look at whether people

53:30.320 --> 53:34.160
are doing it or, you know, I just learn about something brand new that I've not known about before.

53:34.160 --> 53:39.040
Half of my day, if I can, this is a good days. And then half of my day is devoted to this.

53:39.040 --> 53:42.400
Let's keep moving some projects along. Let's keep kind of doing where I was doing.

53:42.400 --> 53:46.000
And then if it's not moving along, you know, I'll, you know, I'll kind of refocus. But,

53:46.880 --> 53:50.720
but those timescales are really important to me. Kind of, you know, the main one is kind of my

53:50.720 --> 53:54.560
overall life. Have I been thinking through all the things I kind of want to think through?

53:54.560 --> 54:00.160
What matters? Do I know enough about X, Y and Z, you know? So, and often that is really

54:00.160 --> 54:07.760
literally getting out undergrad. So, you know, mechanics and game theory, mechanism design.

54:08.880 --> 54:12.320
Absolutely. Because it's helping me to think about new research directions.

54:12.320 --> 54:16.560
Well, the way I do that is I go find a really good senior or junior level textbook.

54:17.360 --> 54:21.120
And I read it like a novel because I just find it really fascinating. Wow. These people thought

54:21.120 --> 54:24.880
this all this stuff. Moreover, I kind of already know enough math that I can kind of just read

54:24.880 --> 54:28.560
it without having a lot of struggle. Like, even the undergrad would have struggled. I don't have

54:28.560 --> 54:35.360
to struggle. It's so fun. And then I do that a little bit all the time. And over time, that's just

54:35.360 --> 54:41.600
kind of, you know, really helped and build up and give me a bit of a perspective. You know, but I

54:41.600 --> 54:50.000
don't feel like I'm necessarily a thought leader that, you know, I think that, you know, I think

54:50.000 --> 54:53.760
that partly that has to do with the era you live in. And maybe we're arriving at the era now

54:53.760 --> 54:57.920
where thought leaders will emerge. That kind of starts to become consequential. Our field is

54:57.920 --> 55:04.720
mattering enough now. And so that we will be kind of burned by doing the wrong thing. And we'll

55:04.720 --> 55:08.320
also kind of learn by doing the right thing. And then maybe after that, your experience will kind

55:08.320 --> 55:12.560
of boost you the level thought leader. But we don't have a lot. Our image she already

55:12.560 --> 55:18.560
feel has not been very consequential. It's really been in this era of just G Wiz kind of, you know,

55:18.560 --> 55:24.240
stuff. And behind the scenes, people have used it to build kind of infrastructure for things like,

55:24.240 --> 55:29.360
you know, Amazon or Google. And that's all great. And some of those people maybe have, you know,

55:29.360 --> 55:34.640
gotten real perspective. But often it's very, very technical and very, very buried. And our field

55:34.640 --> 55:39.040
hasn't kind of emerged like some other fields where they were really having consequences for the

55:39.040 --> 55:43.840
human life. So I'm kind of hoping the younger people will realize that this is what's happening

55:43.840 --> 55:49.120
that our field is going to have major consequences. So educate yourself broadly, spend time every day,

55:49.120 --> 55:55.520
learn a lot of things, and learn how to talk to the outside world, not just yourselves. So

55:57.200 --> 56:03.440
so I'm not sure answer your question, but I hope Antler is a great answer to that question.

56:03.440 --> 56:11.520
I think the the way you structure your time around a thoughtful balance of explore and exploit

56:11.520 --> 56:19.600
is an interesting answer to that question. And so to kind of close things out, you are

56:20.400 --> 56:26.720
you know, very well known for kind of the popularization of a bunch of, you know, techniques

56:26.720 --> 56:32.320
in the machine learning community, you know, Bayesian networks, variational methods, approximate

56:32.320 --> 56:42.480
inference, expectation, maximization. Any thoughts on kind of the, you know, technical, direction

56:42.480 --> 56:51.360
or elements of, you know, the research or, you know, where you see things going kind of at this,

56:52.880 --> 56:56.640
you know, the intersection of machine learning computers and statistics.

56:56.640 --> 57:03.680
Yeah, I know I have lots of thoughts about that kind of thing. If the, especially younger people

57:03.680 --> 57:07.920
want to learn more about my work and thoughts about that, I have there's talks on the web that

57:07.920 --> 57:14.800
you can find. And I think just to say briefly, a lot of my work has had to do with optimization,

57:15.440 --> 57:19.600
kind of what's the best way to do something and even kind of lately, kind of what's the optimal

57:19.600 --> 57:25.200
way to optimize. And so this word variational has had a real impact on my career, my life and my

57:25.200 --> 57:29.680
thinking. Variational just means you take a problem and you turn it into an optimization problem.

57:30.560 --> 57:34.320
All right. And having done that, you can often get new perspective on ways to kind of tweak that

57:34.320 --> 57:38.240
optimization a little bit and solve a slightly different problem and get inside of your original

57:38.240 --> 57:43.760
problem. And so variational methods of all kinds are still kind of very part of my, my way of

57:43.760 --> 57:49.440
thinking. Optimization also has to do with change, it has to do with movement, it has to do with

57:49.440 --> 57:53.840
dynamics. So a lot of my work has to do with dynamical systems, differential equations, partial

57:53.840 --> 57:58.320
neutral equations, stochastic differential equations, how fast they converge, how well they do

57:58.320 --> 58:04.400
in high dimensional spaces. And then with this economics kind of a perspective that is driving me a

58:04.400 --> 58:11.360
lot now, the problem is now not just to go down downhill and find at the minimum of a surface,

58:11.360 --> 58:15.680
is often to find an equilibrium among multiple agents. So how does each agent kind of move towards

58:15.680 --> 58:20.560
equilibrium? So the classical equilibrium game theory, you know, limited perspective, you know,

58:20.560 --> 58:25.520
Nash and Stacklberg and all, that's just kind of, how do you get there? It, you know, was never

58:25.520 --> 58:28.960
really talked about. Well, the whole question is, how do you get there? And how does data inform

58:28.960 --> 58:33.440
how do you get there? And even if there's multiple people interacting in a complex world,

58:33.440 --> 58:38.160
you may never get there. It's more about how do you move? And so lots and lots of interesting things

58:38.160 --> 58:45.040
have to do with stochastic dynamics and the context of games and our perspective on high-dimensional

58:45.040 --> 58:50.400
optimization and so on so forth. So I just have a lot of fun with all the huge mathematical challenges

58:50.400 --> 58:56.160
there. You know, a lot of them are mathematical dynamics and dynamical systems, but then always

58:56.160 --> 59:00.240
behind the scenes is always about inference, about how did you sample things from the real world?

59:00.240 --> 59:05.040
What can you say about the real world based on what you got after your algorithm runs?

59:05.040 --> 59:09.120
What's that tell you about the real world? What's your answer to be? And all these things. So

59:09.120 --> 59:13.920
statistics is kind of in some ways my home field where my heart is. It is the field where I think

59:13.920 --> 59:17.120
the biggest challenges are about. You're trying to say it's not the real world based on something

59:17.120 --> 59:24.800
partial. And that continues to be I think the hardest and most worth worthy field for many of us.

59:27.920 --> 59:32.640
Awesome. Well, Michael, thank you so much for taking the time to share a bit about

59:32.640 --> 59:36.800
what you're thinking about nowadays with us. It was wonderful speaking with you.

59:37.680 --> 59:42.320
It was a real pleasure to talk to you too. Great questions and a lot of a fun hour for me too.

59:42.320 --> 59:50.480
Thank you very much. Thank you.
