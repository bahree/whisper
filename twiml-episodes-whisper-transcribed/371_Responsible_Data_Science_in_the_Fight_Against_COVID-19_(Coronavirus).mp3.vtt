WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:13.760
All right, I think we are live. Hey, everyone, welcome to the broadcast. I am super excited

00:13.760 --> 00:21.080
for our conversation today. Since the very beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, we've

00:21.080 --> 00:26.800
seen an outpouring of interest on the part of data scientists and AI practitioners wanting

00:26.800 --> 00:33.960
to make a contribution. At the same time, some of the resulting efforts have been criticized

00:33.960 --> 00:39.440
for promoting the spread of misinformation or just being disconnected from the applicable

00:39.440 --> 00:51.880
domain knowledge. The question that we're here to address today is how can data scientists

00:51.880 --> 00:58.600
get involved and do so in a responsible manner. And I've got a great panel lined up to help

00:58.600 --> 01:05.760
us do that. Before we dive in, a couple of housekeeping notes. We really, really want

01:05.760 --> 01:11.720
to ensure that this is an interactive discussion. So your comments, whether you're viewing on

01:11.720 --> 01:21.160
YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter, are visible to me, and I'll relay them to our panel. And

01:21.160 --> 01:28.040
it's really my sincere hope that you will help drive a good part of the discussion today.

01:28.040 --> 01:35.240
Next, this is the first of many discussions that we'll be bringing you on a wide range

01:35.240 --> 01:41.720
of topics. To be notified when we schedule future discussions, please just follow or subscribe

01:41.720 --> 01:48.640
to us on whatever channel you are watching right now. Before introducing our panelists,

01:48.640 --> 01:54.360
I'd like to send a shout out to our friends at IBM for their huge support of what we're

01:54.360 --> 02:00.160
doing here at Twilmo generally and this discussion in particular. IBM has been at the forefront

02:00.160 --> 02:05.680
of the fight against coronavirus. Through their leadership and the COVID-19 high performance

02:05.680 --> 02:10.320
computing consortium, they've helped bring together the federal government and industry

02:10.320 --> 02:16.720
and academic leaders in support of COVID-19 research. In addition, they're bringing together

02:16.720 --> 02:23.040
trusted data from governments, the World Health Organization, and the CDC to provide detailed

02:23.040 --> 02:29.920
virus tracking on the weather channel. And they're offering free access to Watson Assistant

02:29.920 --> 02:37.760
to respond to common COVID-19 related questions. For more information on these resources and links

02:52.480 --> 03:01.600
RDS COVID. With that said, I am really excited to introduce myself and our panelists for this

03:01.600 --> 03:09.600
discussion. I'm Sam Charington, founder of Twilmo and host of the Twilmolyi podcast. Rex Douglas

03:09.600 --> 03:16.720
is a computational social scientist and director of the machine learning for social science lab,

03:16.720 --> 03:24.160
MSSL, at the Center for Peace and Security Studies at the University of San Diego.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.840
Rex's research focuses on applying advanced technologies to research problems in

03:31.840 --> 03:40.720
social sciences and policy world, particularly on issues of human conflict. Rob Monroe is a

03:40.720 --> 03:46.960
former guest of the podcast and a long time friend of the show. He's currently CEO of the

03:46.960 --> 03:53.120
machine learning, he's currently CEO of machine learning consulting. Hi, Rob.

03:54.320 --> 03:58.960
Hey, everyone. Rob has extensive experience in crowdsourced data,

03:58.960 --> 04:07.280
disaster response and the intersection of these areas. Leah Shanley is a senior fellow with the

04:07.280 --> 04:13.680
Nelson Institute at the University of Wisconsin Madison, where she focuses on open science

04:13.680 --> 04:21.920
information, innovation strategy and policy, responsible AI and data ethics and expanding diversity

04:21.920 --> 04:31.200
in data science. Welcome, Leah. And GG UN Read is a distinguished engineer and executive

04:31.200 --> 04:37.200
responsible for data science innovations in the healthcare space at IBM, with an emphasis on

04:37.200 --> 04:46.480
the use of predictive models and clinical applications. All righty. So let's jump right in and get

04:46.480 --> 04:51.440
started with a round of questions so that we can get to know our panelists a little bit better.

04:52.240 --> 04:57.520
We'll start with you, Rex. You recently wrote an interesting piece on how to be curious

04:57.520 --> 05:05.280
instead of contrarian about COVID-19, eight data science lessons from a coronavirus perspective.

05:06.720 --> 05:12.000
We're not necessarily going into the specific lesson that you presented that article. We'll come

05:12.000 --> 05:16.800
back to those. Tell us a little bit about the origin of that article and what prompted you to

05:16.800 --> 05:24.720
write it and how that relates to your work at MSSL. Sure. So the big idea is that my note is

05:24.720 --> 05:30.080
ostensibly a takedown of a specific piece that Richard Epstein wrote posted to Hoover,

05:30.080 --> 05:34.720
where he predicted only 500 deaths in the US and made a long list of other false and

05:34.720 --> 05:40.560
sophist arguments. In reality, though, my note is a Trojan horse intended to try to sneak some

05:40.560 --> 05:46.480
basic social science research design methods to a broader audience who may not otherwise

05:46.480 --> 05:53.120
receive that kind of information. I wanted to show by example that these kind of gatekeeping

05:53.120 --> 05:59.280
or lanekeeping arguments are themselves another kind of anti-intellectualism. I argue that

05:59.280 --> 06:04.160
during a crisis, it's exactly when we should be encouraging people to become more curious

06:04.160 --> 06:08.960
and more scientifically rigorous. Right now, a good chunk of the planet actually wants to know

06:08.960 --> 06:14.240
about causal inference and about confidence intervals and about Bayes rule. For God's sakes,

06:14.240 --> 06:24.320
we should be telling them, especially before theaters reopen. Awesome. Rob, a lot of your

06:24.320 --> 06:29.680
perspective on this issue comes from your experience working in disaster response. Share with us

06:29.680 --> 06:34.720
a little bit about your background in this area and the concerns that it raises for you.

06:34.720 --> 06:40.240
Yeah, absolutely. So I've worked as a disaster responder for about 20 years for about the same time

06:40.240 --> 06:46.080
that I've been working as a data scientist. And in every major disaster I've responded to,

06:46.800 --> 06:53.360
I've seen people die as a result of people cutting corners, including actions taken by well-meaning

06:53.360 --> 06:58.640
data scientists, often grabbing media attention when experts should have had that attention.

06:58.640 --> 07:05.520
But like I've also said, I think some of the biggest impact I've had is not when I've been working

07:05.520 --> 07:11.200
in refugee camps or directly disaster response. Some of the biggest impact I've had

07:11.200 --> 07:15.600
has been when I've been at large companies. So I ran AWS's and on the service for a while,

07:15.600 --> 07:20.160
it was on comprehend. And it's when I've been working with large companies like that and

07:20.160 --> 07:25.120
getting them to expand into more languages and think about general ways that tools can be adapted

07:25.120 --> 07:30.640
to different parts of the world. I think that's built a foundational layer that I'm seeing right

07:30.640 --> 07:37.280
now a lot of people responded to COVID using. So I'd love to share on this panel some of the ways

07:37.280 --> 07:43.040
that you can take your existing skills as data scientists and help plug gaps in the COVID response.

07:44.240 --> 07:53.120
Awesome. Leah, much of your work including co-founding citizen science.gov has focused on encouraging

07:53.120 --> 07:58.320
everyday citizens to get involved in science and help accelerate innovations in this country.

07:59.040 --> 08:05.440
My guess is that scientists don't always welcome the input of the quote unquote unwashed masses.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.840
Can you bear a little bit about your experience in this area?

08:09.200 --> 08:13.680
Well, like Rob, I've worked at the intersection and served as a connector between the

08:14.480 --> 08:18.720
academic research community, the tech innovation community, crowdsourcers,

08:18.720 --> 08:25.680
citizen scientists and disaster management practitioners. Like Rob over the last 10 years,

08:25.680 --> 08:34.560
we saw a lot of enthusiasm and well-meaning open data, data scientists and others try to

08:34.560 --> 08:39.920
contribute and innovate in the middle of a crisis. But they lacked an understanding of what the

08:39.920 --> 08:47.600
disaster response community actually needed on the ground. And so we tried to work to build that

08:47.600 --> 08:51.280
bridge between the practitioners, the research community and the digital volunteers.

08:52.480 --> 08:58.880
For citizen science and crowdsourcing, yes, one of the first questions we get when we propose

08:59.680 --> 09:06.080
crowdsourcing or citizen science approaches is what about data quality and that field has

09:06.080 --> 09:11.840
become rather mature and there are a lot of great approaches now for assuring the data quality

09:11.840 --> 09:16.880
levels that you need for a project just as you would with any scientific research or data analysis.

09:18.480 --> 09:24.000
Awesome. And Gigi, your work at IBM involves what you describe as translational science,

09:24.000 --> 09:31.200
so translating between cutting edge, machine learning and AI research and making that accessible

09:31.200 --> 09:37.600
and scalable to your customer and end users. Can you share a little bit about your experience

09:37.600 --> 09:43.840
coming from the clinical and traumatic side of things and how that applies to COVID?

09:45.840 --> 09:53.440
Yeah, it's a very interesting time. I think based on my experience in trying to take cutting

09:53.440 --> 10:00.640
edge technologies to our end users, sometimes a very sophisticated clinician or a consumer who's

10:00.640 --> 10:05.200
trying to understand the risk for the health problem. Thinking through that really,

10:05.200 --> 10:11.520
really drive home the need for transparency. I think near and resonable, we all kind of touch

10:11.520 --> 10:17.280
on palm data. The fact that we got to be transparent, not only on the data and its quality,

10:17.280 --> 10:24.000
but the assumptions that we can use. I think that tends to get overlooked by the end user,

10:24.560 --> 10:29.520
and if it's our responsibility to make sure we work with the domain experts to validate those

10:29.520 --> 10:36.080
assumptions. That's kind of the biggest piece that I'm advocating. I do think data science,

10:36.080 --> 10:40.560
that's what we can do, even to overcome why the issues of data security, privacy,

10:41.200 --> 10:46.560
and how to leverage the streaming data from IoT. I think that's a lot we can contribute on,

10:46.560 --> 10:48.480
with the matter of how to restrict the balance.

10:50.160 --> 10:57.680
Awesome. Once again, I want to remind our viewers to contribute questions via the chat. We will

10:57.680 --> 11:07.040
incorporate those into the conversation, but I'd like to start out really exploring the idea of

11:09.040 --> 11:18.800
what's at stake when data scientists get involved and talk through your examples of where you

11:18.800 --> 11:25.280
seeing help, where you've seen harm, and what folks are really worried about when they kind of

11:25.280 --> 11:32.160
push out their arms and say, hey, data scientists shouldn't really be involved in this without

11:32.160 --> 11:39.600
working with domain experts, whether that be epidemiologists, virologists, what have you.

11:40.560 --> 11:45.120
I'll let you start with this Rob, and then we'll incorporate others.

11:46.160 --> 11:51.520
Sure. Happy to. First off, this isn't you. It's not new that we're seeing data scientists

11:51.520 --> 11:59.120
stepping to disaster response efforts. We have a lot of past examples already, where there

11:59.120 --> 12:04.880
have been very negative effects. I'll give three examples. I also presented all three of these

12:04.880 --> 12:09.760
at the KDD conference last year, one of the largest data science conferences. These should

12:09.760 --> 12:15.040
already be part of the dialogue that people are having around data scientists responding to

12:15.040 --> 12:20.480
disasters. This is not something new, and if you haven't read the papers and the dangers in the

12:20.480 --> 12:26.800
past, you should think carefully about the kind of work that you're undertaking. One of the

12:26.800 --> 12:31.840
biggest negative impacts I've seen was during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa,

12:31.840 --> 12:35.760
having worked in epidemic tracking and having lived in West Africa in the past,

12:35.760 --> 12:42.960
and a lot of work involved in this. One of the biggest causes for unneeded deaths were data

12:42.960 --> 12:48.400
scientists in the West coming up with really like doomsday prediction models about how bad a

12:48.400 --> 12:54.160
Ebola could be. The people who were going on the big media programs during the Ebola outbreak,

12:55.360 --> 12:59.920
they weren't the professional epidemiologists. These were data scientists from adjacent fields,

12:59.920 --> 13:05.120
and the media just eats up their story like this could kill us all. As a result of the international

13:05.120 --> 13:10.320
pressure from the media, filled by people who did not have that expertise, but who looked like

13:10.320 --> 13:15.440
there were experts, there was a lot of misinformation, a lot of people being too scared,

13:15.440 --> 13:19.760
and so we calculated that for every person who died from Ebola in West Africa,

13:20.400 --> 13:25.680
10 more people died from treatable illnesses because they were avoiding hospitals and clinics

13:25.680 --> 13:34.080
unnecessarily. This was a very clear example of where so many people died because of misinformation

13:34.080 --> 13:41.760
that started from well-meaning non-experts. Some of the others relate to open data and data

13:41.760 --> 13:46.560
security, like people have mentioned already. When I was hoping to respond to the previous

13:47.760 --> 13:54.880
coronavirus outbreaks, the SARS-CoV-1 or MERS, we found that because a lot of these outbreaks were

13:54.880 --> 13:59.680
in countries where the rule of law is very different to the West, people go into different

13:59.680 --> 14:05.760
assumptions. For example, Saudi Arabia wanted to find people in social media who were reporting

14:05.760 --> 14:10.960
the actual numbers of patients in hospitals that might have differed from the official

14:10.960 --> 14:15.840
government numbers. We evaluated this at that time and decided that even if this project was

14:15.840 --> 14:21.520
well-meaning and even if it only used open data from people's public tweets, these people could

14:21.520 --> 14:26.880
be seen as disagreeing with the government. It could be persecuted as a result, and so we decided

14:26.880 --> 14:33.440
not to go forward with this particular project. Then the last of three examples, also working in

14:33.440 --> 14:39.280
the Middle East during the uprising in Libya when Gaddafi was overthrown, I was hoping the UN

14:39.280 --> 14:44.320
track displaced people. It seems like a use case that just suggests to be very non-controversial,

14:44.320 --> 14:50.640
like who's internally displaced or refugee in another country and needs help, but people

14:50.640 --> 14:56.480
within the region saw the UN's involvement as being a Western involvement, and our security was

14:56.480 --> 15:02.400
compromised and some people treated as collaborators with a Western invader, not as people helping

15:02.400 --> 15:10.000
in humanitarian efforts. Again, this was set up by data scientists who didn't have a background

15:10.000 --> 15:15.600
in disaster response, technologists who thought they could do good, and ultimately did far more harm

15:15.600 --> 15:21.920
than good. Those are three very negative examples. I'll pass it over to the other panelists here.

15:21.920 --> 15:26.800
I do want to assure everyone watching that. I do have a lot of good examples of ways that people

15:26.800 --> 15:31.520
are hoping and can help that I want to come back to. I want a second Rob's comments. We saw the

15:31.520 --> 15:36.880
same thing and working the disaster space curation of social media for who needs medical care,

15:36.880 --> 15:44.160
who needs water, who needs rescue, etc. It's not just in other countries. It's here in the U.S.

15:44.160 --> 15:51.040
we're seeing retaliations against certain vulnerable populations. While we espouse open data,

15:51.040 --> 15:55.920
I think we need to be careful. As Gigi mentioned, ensure the privacy and security, particularly

15:55.920 --> 16:05.520
around vulnerable populations. Yeah, and this conversation reminds me of it's about six months ago,

16:06.720 --> 16:13.440
where there is a commonly used population health analytics to help stratify individuals for

16:13.440 --> 16:21.040
intervention, to prevent hospital wear mission, where that work was built upon a national

16:21.040 --> 16:26.800
national data set, to understand individuals' health first. What was overlooked is the fact that

16:26.800 --> 16:31.360
the training data set was balanced. Certain demographic tends to have richer data than other.

16:32.560 --> 16:37.680
The mathematics were great. The sensitivities, the specificity were

16:39.680 --> 16:44.240
high quality. Unfortunately, there's a piece of my data bias that we overlook.

16:46.320 --> 16:50.480
That's a piece that we should really think through. Pandemic is really

16:50.480 --> 16:57.920
evolving very quickly. Every local county has very different data composition and data coverage.

16:58.800 --> 17:03.120
As data scientists, I think it's responsible to really think hard about what is the data

17:03.120 --> 17:09.360
that we bring into our models and being very type of local, one of the strengths and weakness

17:09.360 --> 17:15.600
of doing this. We don't keep that in mind and have the discipline to do the bias and diversity

17:15.600 --> 17:27.040
check at the end. We could really sort of advance the allowance. I think those are some great

17:27.040 --> 17:36.160
examples, Rob. It's clear, I think, to everyone that the stakes are high. I'm curious for you,

17:36.160 --> 17:41.040
Rex, based on a conversation from a comment you made in our earlier conversation.

17:41.040 --> 17:48.560
When a lot of people see these kinds of, or think of these kinds of potential harms,

17:49.280 --> 17:54.720
the immediate reaction is, if you don't have an epidemiology degree or a virology degree,

17:55.280 --> 18:01.280
you shouldn't be involved. You should take us a backseat to the experts.

18:04.480 --> 18:10.800
You're a data scientist who is involved in this work, but you don't have a degree in

18:10.800 --> 18:17.760
epidemiology or background and disaster response. How does that occur for you and

18:18.720 --> 18:21.760
how have you reacted to those kind of commentary?

18:25.360 --> 18:31.680
The way I tried to lay out the piece is to make an argument that the difference between good work

18:31.680 --> 18:38.320
and bad work is not your level of expertise in that field or the strength of the quality of your

18:38.320 --> 18:44.800
priors. I define science as a curiosity about the true state of the world and the application

18:44.800 --> 18:51.840
of evidence and methods to form true beliefs than we held yesterday. That holds for every

18:51.840 --> 18:56.400
level of skill and every kind of question or form of empirical inquiry we could form.

18:56.960 --> 19:02.160
There are parts about COVID that the experts don't understand currently. There are things we'd

19:02.160 --> 19:05.760
like to know about what's going to happen in the future that almost no one understands,

19:05.760 --> 19:10.800
and these are probabilistic forecasts. There are smaller things that individuals would like to

19:10.800 --> 19:17.440
understand of the expert recommendations which ones should I follow. What happens when they contradict

19:17.440 --> 19:22.560
each other? What assumptions are the models making and are they getting better or worse over time?

19:22.560 --> 19:28.960
How do I be a smarter consumer of expert information? I don't know a single scientist no matter what

19:28.960 --> 19:35.040
field they're in who isn't climbing up the walls right now trying to understand this global

19:35.040 --> 19:40.480
pandemic and how it affects them, how it affects their family, what they can contribute or better

19:40.480 --> 19:48.000
understand themselves. My big takeaway is that we're not going to be able to prevent bad work

19:48.000 --> 19:52.960
through gatekeeping. The people who are doing bad work before COVID are doing bad work now and

19:52.960 --> 19:57.840
will do bad work in the future. What we can try to do is we can try to encourage people to be

19:57.840 --> 20:04.160
curious and methodologically rigorous and then keep giving them concrete examples and feedback to

20:04.160 --> 20:11.040
positively support them on that journey as they move up the curve. Earlier you brought up a couple

20:11.040 --> 20:18.480
of examples of even the so-called experts to epidemiologists, credentialed epidemiologists

20:19.440 --> 20:28.720
publishing studies that were later shown to be later taken down. Can you mention a couple of those?

20:28.720 --> 20:36.320
Sure, so there's a really good paper called Learning as We Go, which does sensitivity analysis

20:36.320 --> 20:44.080
on that IHME is two for health and metrics evaluation forecast. That is an example of a

20:44.080 --> 20:50.080
credentialed group according to the Lane Keepers, who is producing the most culturally dominant

20:50.080 --> 20:56.960
forecast in the US right now. But they're 95% confidence intervals or write only about 27% of the

20:56.960 --> 21:04.320
time and their accuracy doesn't improve when you shorten the time horizon for their predictions.

21:04.320 --> 21:08.720
And if you actually eyeball the confidence intervals, they get more confident the further out in time

21:08.720 --> 21:12.640
they go. And there's all sorts of problems with their model and all sorts of weird assumptions,

21:12.640 --> 21:18.960
but this kind of picking apart someone else's work, if you have a background in statistics or

21:18.960 --> 21:25.120
causal inference or research design, anyone with that training can start to see the pieces and

21:25.120 --> 21:30.480
understand the underlying problems and maybe contribute some feedback and some review that will

21:30.480 --> 21:39.840
help others in picking between models. Just because they were first to be pitched or they were

21:39.840 --> 21:44.400
able to culturally position themselves as the most influential forecast doesn't mean that they're

21:44.400 --> 21:49.840
the only forecast within epidemiology and it doesn't mean that we should just accept them

21:49.840 --> 21:59.120
because they're provincial. So we had a really interesting question come in via the chat. David

21:59.120 --> 22:06.880
Clement is referring to the peer review process that we've historically used in academic publications

22:06.880 --> 22:16.880
to ensure the quality of research. What's the role of peer review and why or why isn't it helping

22:16.880 --> 22:24.560
in this environment? I can speak to that briefly. So peer review is absolutely helping in this

22:24.560 --> 22:30.400
environment. In many disasters in the past, which came on much faster than COVID,

22:31.840 --> 22:36.800
there was no advantage in cutting the corners of science. So the science itself couldn't be rushed.

22:38.720 --> 22:44.720
What can be sped up is the review process itself. And so this is something that I have seen

22:44.720 --> 22:50.480
different in COVID to previous disasters. I think because it is so global that a lot of major

22:50.480 --> 22:56.880
publications are speeding up this process and letting it be open. So for example, at the largest

22:56.880 --> 23:02.640
computational linguistics conference, ACL, which is coming up, there's now a workshop specifically

23:02.640 --> 23:08.400
focused on COVID. It's an open review. So it's allowed itself to be the right place for these

23:08.400 --> 23:14.400
kinds of discussions to happen. And papers are being reviewed on a rolling basis. So as quickly

23:14.400 --> 23:21.760
as possible, as soon as we've been submitted. So we've been able to really speed up a process

23:21.760 --> 23:26.560
that taken nine months waiting for the right conference to come around in the past and

23:26.560 --> 23:30.720
bring it down to a couple of weeks without cutting corners on the science itself. It's just

23:30.720 --> 23:34.000
been great to see that across a lot of different disciplines at the moment.

23:35.040 --> 23:40.320
And when you've worked to scale up these kinds of citizen science efforts, have you incorporated

23:40.320 --> 23:46.000
or what kind of review processes or checks and balances or peer review have you been able to

23:46.000 --> 23:52.240
incorporate into those kind of programs? Well, with citizen science, you would go through the same

23:52.240 --> 23:58.160
kind of peer review that you would with any scientific research if the intent is to do scientific

23:58.160 --> 24:04.800
research versus say strictly education. So you would still produce published papers that go

24:04.800 --> 24:11.280
through the normal peer review process. And in fact, these days, a lot of citizen science projects

24:11.280 --> 24:17.840
are including the citizen scientist as co-authors on those papers. And in some open peer review process,

24:17.840 --> 24:23.040
you know, people can contribute to the peer review as well. I want to tag on though to Rob's comment

24:24.000 --> 24:30.480
about, you know, a lot of this preprints of the research is being made available and speeding up

24:30.480 --> 24:36.560
the peer review. The White House has issued a call to action to the tech community. They've made

24:36.560 --> 24:46.160
the publishers have made the literature now openly available around COVID. It made a team of

24:46.160 --> 24:50.880
different organizations have gotten to including Microsoft, the National Library of Medicine,

24:50.880 --> 24:57.840
the Chan Zuckerberg initiative to make those articles machine readable. So they now have 29,000

24:57.840 --> 25:02.320
scholarly articles on COVID that are machine readable. The White House now would like the data

25:02.320 --> 25:09.600
science community to develop text and data mining techniques to help speed up, you know, synthesizing

25:09.600 --> 25:16.720
these materials. And they are also provided a set of research questions to help guide some of that.

25:16.720 --> 25:26.480
And that is available on Kaggle. Awesome. Awesome. So Ayadela gets us to our core question, you know,

25:26.480 --> 25:33.760
what can data scientists do to help? And she's specifically asking for resources, but I think there's

25:33.760 --> 25:40.080
a lot to dig into just on, you know, what are things that data scientists need to be thinking about

25:40.080 --> 25:47.760
when they're considering getting involved? Rob, do you want to get us started on that one?

25:47.760 --> 25:52.880
Yeah, sure. I can get through a low new list of things which are really important and for which

25:52.880 --> 25:58.160
they're very little negative consequences. There's a lot of ways that you can jump in and help

25:58.960 --> 26:03.920
without potentially endangering people. So content moderation is huge. If you work at a large

26:03.920 --> 26:08.000
company doing content moderation or if you want to take one of the existing open data sets,

26:08.800 --> 26:14.560
that's really important. So obviously there's a big NLP component to it, but also computer vision.

26:15.200 --> 26:20.960
So for example, a lot of even the bigger companies right now can't do matching on a fake news image

26:20.960 --> 26:26.160
if there's crops slightly differently or it's like in, you know, on below format, etc.

26:26.160 --> 26:30.800
So there's some low hanging fruit there that already exists in open data sets that any research

26:30.800 --> 26:38.080
would help us. Unfortunately, during any disaster, while crime goes down in general, some particularly

26:38.080 --> 26:46.160
nasty people ramp up in scams and exploitation, especially exploitation of miners. So again,

26:46.160 --> 26:50.720
if you're working in content moderation or content health, when you're able to identify scams,

26:50.720 --> 26:55.920
artists or people looking to exploit children, that's incredibly important right now. And again,

26:55.920 --> 27:03.520
this will exist in initiatives for that. Any work in low resource languages is really valuable

27:03.520 --> 27:11.760
right now. So the majority of course that I've had with organizations like WHO have been especially

27:11.760 --> 27:16.400
worried about how to get information out, how to start using natural language processing in low

27:16.400 --> 27:21.680
resource languages, they're not captured in any of the large libraries that we have. Some of the

27:21.680 --> 27:26.160
existing open source data sets that I've helped create for disaster response have low resource

27:26.160 --> 27:33.600
languages or any research into those would be valuable. You see them in AI for all, some Stanford

27:33.600 --> 27:39.920
MIT classes have used them. Udacity is nano-degree in data science uses a set that I created too.

27:40.640 --> 27:46.160
Any of that research would be valuable. And then it's just like a ton of things around the edges.

27:46.160 --> 27:50.960
Like cleaning data is always valuable. I mean, if you turn up to volunteer at your local hospital,

27:51.600 --> 27:54.960
you're not going to be invited into do surgery, you might be given a mop and bucket.

27:56.400 --> 27:58.480
Expect the same thing. If you turn up to...

27:58.480 --> 27:59.520
Technology.

27:59.520 --> 28:03.760
Yeah, so if you turn up to a big organization, they're not going to be sitting there with a

28:03.760 --> 28:08.560
well structured data set ready to go and they just need 10 lines of high torch. But data cleaning

28:08.560 --> 28:14.000
is really important. Scentitation in hospitals is equally as important, especially at the moment.

28:14.000 --> 28:19.840
And so yeah, like that's how I started out for years to do an all the grunt work in disaster

28:19.840 --> 28:28.800
response. And it's a very noble, valuable way to start. The last example, anything around

28:29.680 --> 28:36.080
supply and logistics. So there is no world database of who has what kinds of medical supplies.

28:36.080 --> 28:40.720
And a lot of the world governments are now implementing really basic crawlers and machine learning

28:40.720 --> 28:46.000
systems to work out who has a supply of medical masks or respirators and things like this.

28:46.560 --> 28:52.240
And in almost any disaster response, the supplies and logistics component of it ends up being

28:52.240 --> 28:58.160
the biggest part of it, the most complicated part. And there's a ton of machine learning in supply

28:59.040 --> 29:03.680
supply chains and logistics. But not enough because it hasn't been a popular area for people to

29:03.680 --> 29:08.320
research. And again, like any research in this area would be really valuable for those of us in

29:08.320 --> 29:16.560
disaster response. Anthony Garland asks, what's the role of IOT devices in this pandemic? He's

29:16.560 --> 29:22.880
speaking specifically about personal IOT devices and health trackers like Fitbit, but GGM wondering,

29:23.760 --> 29:30.880
you know, either personal or kind of within hospitals and health care systems or other IOT use

29:30.880 --> 29:37.920
cases are there. Interesting opportunities for data scientists that arise in the intersection

29:37.920 --> 29:47.040
of COVID and IOT? Right. I mean, to ask that to it, right, in terms of personal IOT device,

29:47.040 --> 29:52.640
right? One is there's a lot of interest around better understanding more social policy,

29:52.640 --> 29:58.800
social distancing adherence. The people actually following the orders or guidelines that

29:58.800 --> 30:04.560
is local government. So the personal IOT device has rich rich data to support that.

30:04.560 --> 30:10.960
But of course, we've got to be vigilant with the security and privacy. But we do, we are seeing,

30:10.960 --> 30:17.520
there's a strong correlation to adherence to some other disease curves, right? So I think that's

30:17.520 --> 30:24.880
an area that will be of interest. And then the area will be to help support some of the symptom

30:24.880 --> 30:30.800
checks, right? As opposed to trying to get on a phone call and talk to someone and understand

30:30.800 --> 30:35.040
this sometimes and putting it in the CDC website, there's a lot of opportunities in leveraging

30:35.040 --> 30:41.440
the data that is being connected in this personal fitness devices to help supplement that.

30:42.560 --> 30:47.120
I think about, you know, the fever monitoring devices,

30:48.400 --> 30:54.320
think about, especially for one of the highest good is folks with hypertension and diabetes,

30:54.320 --> 30:59.040
but about those IOT devices, how they can be incorporated to help detect people at

30:59.040 --> 31:05.920
high risk. And trace together is another one where they're looking at the connectivity is

31:05.920 --> 31:14.400
who's exposed to whom. And I'm going to bring it in a privacy way that secures people's privacy,

31:14.400 --> 31:17.760
but alerts them if they've been exposed potentially, if people who've been diagnosed.

31:18.800 --> 31:26.800
Yeah, yeah, that's a great one. In fact, I just had a ethics conversation,

31:26.800 --> 31:31.600
internally, and I'd be on how to have a handle of that. But you may have seen in the latest

31:31.600 --> 31:37.680
White House guidance, there's a point to as employer to support the employees' content resources.

31:37.680 --> 31:43.760
So if you and I have gone to work, and in the next stage, we should be alerted by employers,

31:43.760 --> 31:50.160
someone else on my floor has been tested possible. So how do we do that while protecting the

31:50.160 --> 31:58.480
individual privacy and the instability? So Rob, you took on that question of how can data

31:58.480 --> 32:06.080
scientists help from a use case perspective? Rex, maybe you can take it on from a practices

32:06.080 --> 32:15.440
perspective. Sure. Well, there's two big ways that at least our shop is trying to contribute,

32:15.440 --> 32:20.320
and I think are low-hanging fruit and opportunities for other people in this space.

32:20.320 --> 32:26.240
The first is in the aggregation of existing data, not just cleaning, but munging different

32:26.240 --> 32:35.040
data sources together creates a lot of problems. And my shop day-to-day, we're a knowledge graph

32:35.040 --> 32:40.560
shop that works on aggregating conflict panel data or political science data measured across

32:40.560 --> 32:46.720
countries or localities. And so when COVID counts started coming out of confirmed deaths,

32:46.720 --> 32:52.240
number of tests, it looks just like the data we are working with already. And so we've rapidly

32:52.240 --> 32:58.080
been prototyping a system to aggregate all of the COVID data globally at at least eight province

32:58.080 --> 33:03.360
or state level and preferably below. So we're up to about 300,000 observations, a couple dozen

33:03.360 --> 33:09.360
data sets, and doing that kind of work is something I think any data science shop can contribute to.

33:09.360 --> 33:15.600
The other one is evaluation of models and predictions. If there's anything ML people know how to do,

33:15.600 --> 33:21.840
it's how to create a test set and take a split. And I just want to do a shout out from one project,

33:21.840 --> 33:29.120
I know of Nicholas Reich's lab at UMass Amherst, has been collecting the predictions and forecasts

33:29.120 --> 33:34.400
from different groups, normalizing them, putting them into the same sheet, and then seeing how they

33:34.400 --> 33:40.080
perform over time and even creating an ensemble prediction based on all of them. And that is something

33:40.080 --> 33:45.200
we can immediately start trying to do is evaluate and combine the forecasts we have already. And the

33:45.200 --> 33:49.680
faster we do that, the more informed decisions we'll be able to make in the next couple months

33:49.680 --> 33:58.720
about reopening in the US or other places. Any other takes on that? Things that data scientists need

33:58.720 --> 34:05.440
to be thinking about when they're considering jumping in and helping out?

34:07.280 --> 34:11.280
Listening to the panelists, right, two things come to mind. I think we're out your earlier point

34:11.280 --> 34:21.280
about NLP in addition to helping with clinical and genetic discovery, looking at various literature,

34:21.280 --> 34:26.880
that there is a strong desire to better understand local government's policy. It's changing on a

34:26.880 --> 34:33.360
daily basis. One of us, you know, to deal with bus models, we had to look at cost geography

34:33.360 --> 34:38.800
while really being careful about local differences. So if you could spend more time

34:40.000 --> 34:45.040
enabling policy insights to the NLP, it could be very valuable.

34:45.040 --> 34:56.640
Oh, go ahead. Go ahead. GovLab did kind of a rapid assessment of different topic areas that

34:56.640 --> 35:05.680
could be looked at and proposed at least 12 areas, going beyond tracking disease spread and supply

35:05.680 --> 35:11.360
chain of the PPE to protecting human rights and promoting accountability, you know, oversight of

35:11.360 --> 35:17.760
governments and their actions with COVID, alleviating pandemic related and unemployment and poverty,

35:18.480 --> 35:24.560
education, upskilling, identifying which businesses may be at most risk and helping inform

35:24.560 --> 35:30.720
policymakers of that as they make their decisions. And as we talk together in the pre-planning

35:30.720 --> 35:32.960
meeting, identifying and tracking misinformation.

35:32.960 --> 35:46.000
So misinformation is, you know, didn't come up in specifically in talking about some of the

35:46.000 --> 35:52.560
potential harms, but it's kind of the backdrop of a lot of the, you know, angst that comes up in

35:52.560 --> 35:59.920
this conversation. You know, any specific examples of misinformation or disinformation relating

35:59.920 --> 36:10.240
to COVID that any of you have seen? Yeah, I've seen a lot related to, I guess, basically you could

36:10.240 --> 36:16.160
you could call folk remedies and that's in every country in the world. So whether it's something

36:16.160 --> 36:24.560
of no known benefits like COVID-opathy here in the United States or other local remedies in other

36:24.560 --> 36:31.440
parts of the world, this happens in every disaster and every disease outbreak. It can be very

36:31.440 --> 36:37.040
dangerous when that misinformation relates to poisonous things. So as soon as we introduce

36:37.040 --> 36:41.040
something like bleach as a cleaning agent and then in disaster, we know some percent of people

36:41.040 --> 36:46.640
are going to drink it. As what happened with, I think it was chloroquine or certainly some other

36:46.640 --> 36:53.920
quinine derivative here where people drank it who didn't even absorb symptoms and then people died.

36:55.680 --> 37:01.520
So yeah, this is, you know, off the back of well-meaning people, people who think there are solutions

37:01.520 --> 37:07.760
or there are types of protective measures which they believe are way better or way worse than they

37:07.760 --> 37:15.120
truly are. And this becomes the biggest worry for us when celebrities get behind it because no

37:15.120 --> 37:20.160
public health organization can compete, you know, with the Hollywood celebrity with tens of

37:20.160 --> 37:27.120
millions of followers on social media. So it's really tough for us when a lot of these celebrities

37:28.080 --> 37:35.760
will double down, you know, maybe on remedies that they have a financial stake in, like that

37:35.760 --> 37:43.520
stupid good product. And so that's, we see a lot of the danger because, you know, we can't

37:43.520 --> 37:48.400
compete with those kinds of people in social media and a lot of them are being kicked off in social

37:48.400 --> 37:53.360
media, YouTube and Facebook especially have been great at this. But it's always trailing. The

37:53.360 --> 37:58.800
damage has often been done by the time this content gets removed. I think they also thought that 5G

38:00.800 --> 38:07.040
causing coronavirus so people were burning down the 5G towers. There's an organization news guard

38:07.040 --> 38:12.080
which has a misinformation tracker around COVID and I think the credibility coalition and the

38:12.080 --> 38:18.560
missing folk on folks are also have efforts on this regard. Yeah, so I think as a data scientist,

38:18.560 --> 38:22.560
this is one area where you can use your critical judgment. Similar to what we're actually saying

38:22.560 --> 38:27.040
earlier, you know what a good report, what versus a bad report looks like. You should be able to

38:27.040 --> 38:32.960
evaluate objectively whether a public official has experience in this area, whether they're

38:32.960 --> 38:37.280
calling on peer-reviewed articles when they present their evidence versus someone who's

38:37.280 --> 38:42.560
share in their end of total experience. And as the data scientist and your family, you probably

38:42.560 --> 38:48.000
have a better critical thinking capacity than most other people. And so I hope in your family

38:48.720 --> 38:54.160
become better critical thinkers and how to evaluate any advice skeptically and choose the best

38:54.160 --> 38:58.560
advice when there's conflicting advice. That's a really valuable thing that you can do in your

38:58.560 --> 39:04.240
community. There's also a big need for data scientists in this research space. So when I ran the

39:04.240 --> 39:08.640
big one of the big data innovation hubs for the National Science Foundation, we had a community

39:08.640 --> 39:15.440
of a hundred researchers, data scientists, digital anthropologists, political scientists, all

39:16.080 --> 39:21.760
bringing to bear their different disciplines to understand, track and develop mitigation strategies

39:21.760 --> 39:30.800
for misinformation. You know, I would like to comment too. Sometimes the information is true,

39:30.800 --> 39:35.440
but it's not actionable to your situation. I think that's the piece that I tend to see often.

39:36.480 --> 39:42.080
For instance, we hear how a lot of local hospitals are having resource storage,

39:43.040 --> 39:50.160
patients that we turn away, or that's in a call to ask them on critical or elected surgeries to

39:50.160 --> 39:57.760
take a pause. And it's very, it really depends on the local health system. And we're seeing that

39:57.760 --> 40:03.280
there are a few conditions that shouldn't have gone down, are going down in areas. Like there,

40:03.280 --> 40:09.520
less heart attack, there's less asthma attack, and there's less trauma cases. And in some sense,

40:09.520 --> 40:12.800
it could make sense because people are not traveling as much, but the rate of the increase is a

40:12.800 --> 40:18.400
little alarming. So hospital resource storage does apply to your local area. I think that's,

40:18.400 --> 40:23.360
you know, we've got to help our community to think through that. It's true. If I have someone

40:23.360 --> 40:30.880
city, it's a stature for the way I live, and that's one of the things. We started off talking about

40:31.920 --> 40:38.880
examples of the potential harms, but what about specific examples of where data science is

40:38.880 --> 40:47.040
helping out and making an impact? Leah, you had a few. There's like, there are lots of different

40:47.040 --> 40:52.800
opportunities, I think, for data scientists and other data-related folks to plug in,

40:52.800 --> 40:58.000
in very positive ways. I think in our discussions, we talk about, you not only need the data

40:58.000 --> 41:02.480
science at the table, but you need the epidemiologists, the virologists, immunologists,

41:03.360 --> 41:07.920
economists, and other kinds of professionals. So there's several opportunities where they're

41:07.920 --> 41:14.400
bringing these kind of teams of folks together. MIT COVID challenges one where they're looking at

41:14.400 --> 41:22.160
innovating, using data and other approaches for solutions in Africa. The DevPost Global Hackathon

41:22.160 --> 41:26.880
is another place. We'll put provide those links afterwards. They've got to think something like

41:26.880 --> 41:34.400
18,000 people signed up to contribute. The US Digital Response Team, which is started by some

41:34.400 --> 41:40.880
former White House deputy chief technology officers, has now got over 4,000 volunteers,

41:40.880 --> 41:47.760
and they're pairing those data science back end engineers, product managers with local government

41:47.760 --> 41:54.400
folks to help build websites, things that are free, open source, and extensible or replicable

41:54.400 --> 42:01.040
to other locations. And then in the citizen science space, we've got Folding at Home, which is

42:01.040 --> 42:07.760
using distributed computing. So if you want to, like, study at home, donate your computing resources

42:07.760 --> 42:13.680
to help solve some of the medical challenges around COVID, there's the coronavirus binder

42:13.680 --> 42:20.560
design game, which is developed by Foldit. So we've got a serious gamers figuring out how a protein

42:20.560 --> 42:25.920
related to coronavirus works, and figuring out how they might disrupt that protein.

42:26.560 --> 42:31.840
Eternet is another one of these online series games that requires some complex problem-solving

42:31.840 --> 42:36.880
that having a data scientist tell probably would be helpful. And then, you know, as I think Gigi

42:36.880 --> 42:42.720
mentioned, there's not just COVID we have to worry about, but now we've got some fabulous air

42:42.720 --> 42:48.080
quality, right? So doing things like monitoring air quality, doing things like monitoring water

42:48.080 --> 42:53.520
quality, it's Earth Day, and how is this impact of COVID on our environment? There's a big

42:53.520 --> 42:59.520
opportunity for folks with IoT skills, data science skills, Earth observation, geospatial mapping

42:59.520 --> 43:09.360
to help with those efforts too. Other examples of where data scientists, non-epidemiologists,

43:09.360 --> 43:16.560
virologists are jumping in and adding value. So no one's mentioned kind of the efforts from

43:16.560 --> 43:22.480
journalism, and a lot of newspapers have data scientists on staff now, so I just wanted to

43:22.480 --> 43:29.040
point out that the main source of tracking for testing in the US is the COVID tracking project,

43:29.040 --> 43:37.040
which came out of an effort by the Atlantic and two journalists in India. COVID-19 India is a

43:37.040 --> 43:44.640
massive crowdsourced effort. If you go on GitHub, you can go country name by country name and find

43:44.640 --> 43:52.240
at least one data scientist or beginner who has started scraping the local health ministry website

43:52.240 --> 43:58.240
and getting unstructured data into a structured form that we can then use. I think one of the

43:58.240 --> 44:06.960
one of the main comparisons here is not between epidemiologist and expert scientific experts

44:06.960 --> 44:14.480
and civilians or data scientists or amateurs. It's between government resources and capabilities

44:15.040 --> 44:21.440
and the civilian capital, social capital to work on that. So if the New York Times is the one

44:21.440 --> 44:26.880
who's putting together county level counts of COVID in the US and not the federal government,

44:26.880 --> 44:32.560
that tells you something. New York Times and Rooters are both tracking that at the county level

44:32.560 --> 44:37.680
because there isn't a strong federal system with reporting all the way up the chain and all the

44:37.680 --> 44:43.520
way down the chain. It's newspapers collating this information for us. And so we have to step in

44:43.520 --> 44:48.320
where the institutions fall short and that can only be done by regular people.

44:48.320 --> 44:59.760
David Clement asked another really interesting question about how the role of data science shifts

44:59.760 --> 45:07.760
as this pandemic continues. Early efforts have been involved in modeling and dashboards and the

45:07.760 --> 45:13.840
like. But what does the role of data science need to evolve to as time goes on? Any thoughts on that?

45:13.840 --> 45:18.880
Yeah, I can I can speak to some part of it. I certainly can't speak for for all the data

45:18.880 --> 45:25.680
science and how it can respond. One of the most constant things I'm seeing working with really

45:25.680 --> 45:33.360
large organizations doing public health and misinformation is the areas where we can get help

45:33.360 --> 45:38.400
from data scientists. So almost all the systems I'm looking at don't have much data to begin with

45:38.400 --> 45:43.600
and they need to bootstrap from not many examples. So human in the loop systems, smart active

45:43.600 --> 45:48.560
learning, adapting to low resource languages with with inconsistent spellings and more complicated

45:48.560 --> 45:54.160
suffixes and prefixes. Lots of really important problems that just aren't part of what most

45:54.160 --> 45:59.600
data scientists learn. Most data scientists will learn about purely automated methods where the

45:59.600 --> 46:06.240
data is constant and the data is never constant in in disaster response. So a lot of the things

46:06.240 --> 46:12.400
that might look useful for multilingual NLP like zero-shot learning really aren't that useful.

46:12.400 --> 46:17.680
Zero-shot learning requires fairly large unsupervised, unchanging corpus and the percentage difference

46:17.680 --> 46:24.080
doesn't doesn't change a whole lot. What we need more is people who can think about the productization

46:25.280 --> 46:33.440
human in the loop systems where it's the human either expert or non expert for example giving

46:33.440 --> 46:38.560
medical advice who can look up a database or maybe the right answers and give that advice.

46:38.560 --> 46:43.280
And so this is one of the areas that I've been given advice to. So a lot of major companies working

46:43.280 --> 46:47.680
in this area have been introduced to a lot of data scientists. So data scientists that all the big

46:47.680 --> 46:51.840
tech companies are willing to step up and do the right work. But they're going to introduce to

46:51.840 --> 46:56.880
the wrong people. They get introduced to someone who can do a cutting edge paper in zero-shot or

46:56.880 --> 47:01.920
one-shot learning. Whereas actually the data scientists who probably have the best knowledge,

47:01.920 --> 47:10.080
they work in content moderation or they help out with customer success for customer service systems.

47:10.720 --> 47:15.280
So I think a lot of that human computer interaction side of data science which I find really

47:15.280 --> 47:21.680
fascinated. I think that becomes way more useful in a disaster response environment and

47:21.680 --> 47:28.400
I would love to see more people picking that up. Gigi, I think you had something to add to this one.

47:28.400 --> 47:39.680
Yeah, I was smiling because let's on the technology aspect. But as we think through the use cases,

47:39.680 --> 47:43.920
as many countries are trying to figure out how to recover and get back to the new normal,

47:44.560 --> 47:48.880
I think we have to think through like care delivery will not be the same anymore.

47:49.680 --> 47:53.840
Like half of the care today in America is delivered to a telemedicine and I think that's

47:53.840 --> 48:00.560
statistically even higher than that. So what can we do for the scientists to help improve

48:02.640 --> 48:10.080
not only how monitoring but the experience between the clinician and the patient as they are

48:10.080 --> 48:15.360
more longer able to physically touch right. So the signs of haptic skin tell me, the signs of

48:16.960 --> 48:22.560
how the share and transmit monitoring data all that comes in. And another

48:22.560 --> 48:29.040
we have to allow us whereas as a teacher, as an educator, we will be delivering our education

48:29.040 --> 48:35.520
material in a very different way. How can we make them more interactive and how can we learn from

48:36.480 --> 48:40.160
and imagine the data that we are collecting these online systems. How can we learn from that

48:40.160 --> 48:47.200
and really provide it in much more rich experience for our students. So my mind actually went

48:47.200 --> 48:53.120
in a way of, okay, in a new normal, not only in health, but in many many disciplines,

48:53.120 --> 48:58.000
on their normal opportunities for us. The idea of the new normal is an interesting one. I saw

48:58.000 --> 49:05.600
an article the other day that talked about how in Milan, they're taking advantage of the change in

49:06.800 --> 49:12.720
the traffic situation in the core city to implement some pro cycling measures. So they're

49:12.720 --> 49:18.720
going to be producing the vehicular traffic in the city core and adding bike lanes and things like

49:18.720 --> 49:27.120
that. And you know, the new normal is going to be new and it will provide a lot of opportunities

49:27.120 --> 49:35.280
for folks to jump in and help with the kind of modeling that they've done in non epidemiology domains.

49:35.280 --> 49:48.160
So we've got a number of questions that have come in that relate to the kind of data that

49:49.120 --> 50:00.160
we're seeing being published by media and experts talking about. I think a lot of these questions

50:00.160 --> 50:07.920
are getting at kind of the, you know, a couple of things, a lack of confidence on the part of

50:07.920 --> 50:15.200
the information consumer as in terms of what media we can trust as well as the rapidity with which

50:15.200 --> 50:23.360
viewpoints are changing. We've got, you know, folks showing data on different sides of, you know,

50:23.360 --> 50:31.440
the utility of masks and the position that local governments and organizations like WHO CDC

50:31.440 --> 50:41.440
is shifting over time. We've got similar types of, you know, data on different sides of social

50:41.440 --> 50:51.840
distancing. Any thoughts on like cutting through the, you know, cutting through these differing

50:51.840 --> 50:56.560
perspectives and more importantly, how do data scientists help their communities cut through

50:56.560 --> 51:05.520
these differing perspectives? Well, I'll say be very wary of the media for one, you know, most

51:05.520 --> 51:10.320
journalists are great people and they want to report things honestly, but media companies are not

51:10.320 --> 51:18.560
aligned with providing you the most important information that you need. A lot of media companies

51:18.560 --> 51:22.800
have the same narratives in every disaster and it's that the responders aren't doing the right

51:22.800 --> 51:28.880
job. Why is this being ignored? Why did somebody cover this up? Why is there a conspiracy here?

51:29.440 --> 51:34.880
And even when journalists know that they, it's not a real story, it's part of the narrative

51:34.880 --> 51:41.440
they have to tell. And you can be smart about this. If you see stories come out and there's no author

51:43.120 --> 51:47.840
in a big publication that they normally know that they're spreading misinformation or they get

51:47.840 --> 51:52.320
an invited expert opinion who is no expert at all, I'd just say something outrageous.

51:53.520 --> 51:58.800
But it can be, yeah, it can be tough. I mean, I haven't said that like, I mean, like Rex said,

51:58.800 --> 52:02.560
like some of the most useful sources of information have come from

52:03.120 --> 52:08.240
den scientists and journalists working together. So yeah, I'll flag that there's a lot of variety,

52:09.360 --> 52:12.960
but yeah, the media is tough to trust a lot of the time.

52:12.960 --> 52:19.200
So you mentioned working with local communities. I had mentioned the US Digital Response,

52:19.200 --> 52:23.200
which is working with local government, but there are other examples like the Data Science,

52:23.200 --> 52:30.000
Federation, and Southern California. That was started by Gene Holm, who's in the CIO's office

52:30.000 --> 52:36.320
at the City of Los Angeles, and they've partnered with 18 universities and organizations in the

52:36.320 --> 52:44.960
area. So the students and faculty and staff are working closely with the City. Students and faculty

52:44.960 --> 52:51.840
and the other volunteers bring the Data Science expertise. The City brings the problem space,

52:51.840 --> 52:57.520
the use cases where they need that help, and that's kind of a local on the ground use case.

52:59.520 --> 53:03.760
You know, I was listening to you, Rob, and I think what do I do? What do I advise myself

53:03.760 --> 53:09.040
in my choosing to do when you're exposed to this different news channel and information? I think

53:09.040 --> 53:13.200
the first thing I go to, of course, the author and the citation. I think the second thing I'll

53:13.200 --> 53:21.040
advise you to pay attention to is the metric. You can very quickly tell the thoughtfulness of the

53:21.040 --> 53:25.440
numbers behind the scene in how do we put the metric, right? It's just a number of cases, so a number

53:25.440 --> 53:31.040
of cases per capita. That is a basic, for example, but many ways you can ask you if you focus on

53:31.040 --> 53:37.920
the metrics that's being used and being reported, and you ask yourself, this is translatable.

53:37.920 --> 53:44.160
I think that is a good indicator for me. A corollary is to look at the why

53:44.160 --> 53:49.280
access of the graph and whether the numbers are jumping around like some of the ones that we've

53:49.280 --> 53:56.240
seen going around. There's been some interesting variations on log scales. I thought that was

53:56.240 --> 54:04.160
complicated. It's a log scale and check the units, right? Things that you learn in elementary

54:04.160 --> 54:09.440
school, it's very, very relevant. Well, then there's even a scale. If there's not a scale in the

54:09.440 --> 54:16.000
first place, that's a really good indication. It's something going on. It's actually, if I could

54:16.000 --> 54:19.840
make one point, I think there's a piece that someone else could overlook their thoughts, right?

54:20.800 --> 54:24.880
Especially coming into a new field, what is the right metric to use? What is the right

54:24.880 --> 54:29.520
scaling path to use? We've got to be careful of that, and coach looks at what we work with.

54:30.560 --> 54:36.640
One quick point on this that I raised in my piece is that not just the media, but some of these

54:36.640 --> 54:44.000
political actors are producing speech that they know is wrong, or they're incurious about what the

54:44.000 --> 54:50.720
right answer is. They just have to produce a particular viewpoint. Their mistake here is to

54:50.720 --> 54:56.560
try to respond to that point for point. There's something called the Gish Gallup, which is a

54:58.160 --> 55:04.160
yeah, it's a debating tactic where you just spam bad arguments as quickly as you can, because

55:04.880 --> 55:09.760
the time it takes to explain why those are wrong is longer than it takes to make the argument

55:09.760 --> 55:17.040
in the first place. We have a risk here where certain media or certain political actors are

55:17.040 --> 55:24.640
producing false speech at a rate faster than we could possibly debunk it. And frankly, if you're

55:24.640 --> 55:28.640
an expert in these fields, you shouldn't be spending your time debunking this. You should be

55:28.640 --> 55:35.280
producing work and getting us to the right answer independently. So the only response that I found

55:35.280 --> 55:42.160
has either been through speech like comedy and satire, where the daily show used to take apart

55:42.160 --> 55:48.400
bad arguments for you in a very creative way quickly, or through positive education. We have to

55:48.400 --> 55:55.120
provide scientific literacy to our families and to our population so that they can tell a bad

55:55.120 --> 56:01.440
argument no matter which day or year or decade it's made in on what topic. That's getting it at

56:01.440 --> 56:07.040
the bud is the only way to protect them. It's like a vaccine against bullshit. And it's the only

56:07.040 --> 56:13.120
hope. Otherwise, you'll bankrupt yourself trying to go beat for beat with these people. On the satire

56:13.120 --> 56:20.320
front, there was an article that was responding to another article that purported that public

56:20.320 --> 56:28.560
transportation was one of the key spreaders of the virus in New York City, based on correlation

56:28.560 --> 56:34.880
between, you know, I forget what the specifics were when the city shut down and public transit usage

56:34.880 --> 56:43.680
or some random correlation and the satirists and author basically took the same argument and

56:43.680 --> 56:49.680
article and rewrote it with the correlation being to bike sharing using the bike sharing data.

56:50.400 --> 56:56.960
It's poke fun at the argument. We're coming up to the top of the hour. I want to take another

56:56.960 --> 57:04.880
couple of audience questions to help us close out. So Megan asks a question referring to

57:06.720 --> 57:14.560
COVID-19 data sets but brings up the broader issue of bias. And this relates to something that

57:14.560 --> 57:22.000
you open up with Gigi as well as the idea of transparency. Can you speak a little bit to the

57:22.000 --> 57:28.720
importance of bias and transparency and things that we need to be thinking about both generally and

57:28.720 --> 57:39.120
when dealing with these data sets? Yes, absolutely. Really being, it's okay, I call the gating

57:39.120 --> 57:45.040
requirement. It's first take a look at the completeness coverage and distribution of your data,

57:45.040 --> 57:48.640
right? And I think it's more than important especially when we're dealing with public

57:48.640 --> 57:55.440
health situation to consider the dimensions of not just demographic groups but different

57:56.800 --> 58:04.560
local diversity sets. So I think that's the piece that we're very passionate about.

58:04.560 --> 58:08.560
And secondarily, I'll go beyond just the data set. I think it goes back to my earlier point

58:08.560 --> 58:14.160
about being transparent on the assumptions that we are making. It's amazing, right? If you look at

58:14.160 --> 58:19.520
the epidemiology model, if you include as a atomic patient or if you don't include as a

58:19.520 --> 58:24.160
tonic patient, you could get two different times differences in results. If you don't mention that

58:24.160 --> 58:30.640
to your reader, then I think we're not doing our job. So transparency in data and transparency

58:30.640 --> 58:37.760
in assumptions. Any additional thoughts from our panel on bias and transparency or data sets?

58:37.760 --> 58:45.520
Stay tuned, we're working on a piece called how to be careful with COVID counts that's going to

58:45.520 --> 58:53.280
investigate that in question exactly. And if I could add one thing, right? It's interesting how

58:53.280 --> 59:00.160
we often report on cases and deaths as opposed to recoveries. It's also interesting how we don't

59:00.160 --> 59:05.840
report on testing availability and data in a driver of what we see in the results. So I think not

59:05.840 --> 59:14.880
that. I look forward to the article. Bernard asks, and this is a great question to help us wrap up,

59:14.880 --> 59:21.120
is there a responsible data science 101 out there that folks can go to and have a look at?

59:23.360 --> 59:28.800
I start with the article I wrote about five ways that data scientists can help and five mistakes

59:28.800 --> 59:35.920
to avoid. There's a lot of links in there. If you want to do deeper reading about things that

59:35.920 --> 59:42.480
worked and things that didn't work in the past too. And Rex's article as well. And in fact, we'll

59:42.480 --> 59:50.000
link to all of these articles and other resources that have been mentioned in this conversation and

59:50.000 --> 59:58.880
that our panelists have to share on the program page for this, which is at twomolei.com slash

59:59.600 --> 01:00:08.160
rdscovid. Matume asks about that term that you used Rex in the context of debating. We'll get

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:15.760
that in there as well. But at this point, I'd like to thank all of our panel for participating in

01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:25.440
this great discussion. Thanks, everyone. Thanks for having us. Thanks for joining us.
