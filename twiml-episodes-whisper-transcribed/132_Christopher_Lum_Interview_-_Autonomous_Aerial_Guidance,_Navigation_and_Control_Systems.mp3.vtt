00:00.000 --> 00:16.320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

00:16.320 --> 00:21.480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:21.480 --> 00:31.240
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:31.240 --> 00:36.600
You've heard me mention my upcoming AI Summit previously and while I am just so excited

00:36.600 --> 00:39.520
because it's right around the corner.

00:39.520 --> 00:44.240
The event takes place April 30th and May 1st in Las Vegas in conjunction with the Interop

00:44.240 --> 00:46.600
ITX conference.

00:46.600 --> 00:51.160
If you're an IT technology or business leader who needs to get smart on the broad spectrum

00:51.160 --> 00:56.520
of machine learning and AI opportunities in the enterprise or someone in your organization

00:56.520 --> 01:01.480
fits that description and can benefit from a level up in this area, you should definitely

01:01.480 --> 01:04.320
make plans to join us in Vegas.

01:04.320 --> 01:09.280
I'll be presenting an introductory session on ML and AI fundamentals and we'll have deep

01:09.280 --> 01:15.520
dive sessions on AI for NLP and conversational applications, computer vision and Internet

01:15.520 --> 01:17.640
of things on Monday.

01:17.640 --> 01:22.400
And then on Tuesday we'll be discussing data collection and annotation, operationalizing

01:22.400 --> 01:25.880
and managing AI and building out your AI strategy.

01:25.880 --> 01:30.680
Then, you'll have a chance to discuss your organization's unique AI opportunities and

01:30.680 --> 01:34.320
challenges with our distinguished experts.

01:34.320 --> 01:40.800

01:48.000 --> 01:53.800
Okay, in this episode I'm joined by Christopher Lum, research assistant professor in the University

01:53.800 --> 01:58.080
of Washington's Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

01:58.080 --> 02:03.040
Chris also co-heads the University's Autonomous Flight Systems Lab, where he and his students

02:03.040 --> 02:08.160
are working on the guidance, navigation and control of unmanned systems.

02:08.160 --> 02:12.360
In our conversation, we discuss some of the technical and regulatory challenges of building

02:12.360 --> 02:15.920
and deploying unmanned autonomous systems.

02:15.920 --> 02:20.640
We also talk about some interesting work he's doing on evolutionary path planning systems,

02:20.640 --> 02:24.200
as well as a precision agriculture use case.

02:24.200 --> 02:28.800
Finally, Chris shares some great starting places for those looking to begin a journey

02:28.800 --> 02:30.800
into autonomous systems research.

02:30.800 --> 02:38.640
Alright, let's roll.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.840
Alright everyone, I am on the line with Chris Lum.

02:41.840 --> 02:48.520
Chris is a research assistant professor at the University of Washington in the Department

02:48.520 --> 02:51.640
of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

02:51.640 --> 02:57.240
And Chris has joined us today to talk about some of his work in autonomous vehicles.

02:57.240 --> 02:58.560
Chris, welcome to the podcast.

02:58.560 --> 03:01.200
Hi, well, thank you so much for having me, Sam.

03:01.200 --> 03:02.600
Thank you for joining us.

03:02.600 --> 03:07.040
I'm really looking forward to diving into the discussion here.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.520
Why don't we get started by having you tell us a little bit about your background and

03:10.520 --> 03:14.000
how you got involved in autonomous vehicles?

03:14.000 --> 03:20.280
Sure, actually, my background is fairly simple, basically, I've been at the University

03:20.280 --> 03:25.600
of Washington for around, I guess, what is this now, about the past 18 years.

03:25.600 --> 03:34.040
I started in 1999 as an undergrad and I finished my PhD there in 2009 in Aeronautics and Astronautics.

03:34.040 --> 03:37.680
And I've been in my current position as a research assistant professor for about the past

03:37.680 --> 03:39.440
two years or so.

03:39.440 --> 03:44.880
I think I've heard it referred to as being a lifer and I can't really tell if that's

03:44.880 --> 03:45.880
the end.

03:45.880 --> 03:49.600
If that's a term of endearment or maybe it's some sort of cautionary term of what happens

03:49.600 --> 03:54.680
if you get stuck in the same institution for too long and can't get a real job, but

03:54.680 --> 03:59.760
at any event, I've been interested in unmanned systems and aircraft probably since around

03:59.760 --> 04:02.320
the late 90s, early 2000s.

04:02.320 --> 04:06.680
So the University of Washington was actually part of the team that put the first robotic

04:06.680 --> 04:11.560
aircraft across the Atlantic Ocean around this time frame and pretty much ever since then

04:11.560 --> 04:15.160
I've been fascinated with applications of unmanned aerial systems.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.160
Oh, fantastic.

04:17.160 --> 04:23.840
You know, I've noted this in a previous podcast on this topic, but you've got to, I'm

04:23.840 --> 04:30.080
sure a unique perspective on this being so close to Boeing, but, you know, currently

04:30.080 --> 04:35.800
we think of autonomous vehicles largely in the context of self-driving cars, but there's

04:35.800 --> 04:40.880
a ton of work that has happened in this space around flying vehicles.

04:40.880 --> 04:45.840
Yeah, absolutely, and I know several of your recent guests have all been talking about

04:45.840 --> 04:46.840
self-driving cars.

04:46.840 --> 04:51.320
And as you mentioned, it's pretty much a very hot topic of research right now.

04:51.320 --> 04:56.000
But, you know, I'm not entirely versed on the history of self-driving cars, but I would

04:56.000 --> 05:01.400
probably guess that autonomous aircraft and some of the research in that realm has been

05:01.400 --> 05:04.240
going on quite a bit longer than that.

05:04.240 --> 05:09.400
It started to gain a lot of traction kind of in the early 90s here, a lot of some of

05:09.400 --> 05:16.240
the technology finally came to fruition to kind of enable a lot of the current iteration

05:16.240 --> 05:19.040
of what you might think of as an unmanned aerial system.

05:19.040 --> 05:23.200
But yeah, this research has been going on for quite a while in this space, and in some

05:23.200 --> 05:27.760
senses, I think it's an easier problem, and in some senses, it's definitely a more difficult

05:27.760 --> 05:28.760
one.

05:28.760 --> 05:35.720
I'm really looking forward to hearing you dig into those two areas, but for context, why

05:35.720 --> 05:40.960
don't we get started, or for context, why don't you tell us a little bit about your research

05:40.960 --> 05:41.960
focus?

05:41.960 --> 05:42.960
Sure.

05:42.960 --> 05:47.840
So, the lab that I direct up at the University of Washington is called the Autonomous

05:47.840 --> 05:53.320
Flight Systems Laboratory, and basically we're interested in pretty much researching any

05:53.320 --> 05:59.680
technology that's related to guidance, navigation, and control of unmanned systems or automation

05:59.680 --> 06:00.680
in general here.

06:00.680 --> 06:06.880
So, a lot of the times that has projects like looking at autonomous mapping here, or

06:06.880 --> 06:12.520
maybe performing risk assessment of an unmanned mission, or looking at maybe path planning.

06:12.520 --> 06:16.240
So, there's a couple of different projects we've looked at in the past, but the one

06:16.240 --> 06:21.640
flavor that unifies them all is they have some technology that's related to an aircraft

06:21.640 --> 06:23.960
or autonomy in general.

06:23.960 --> 06:24.960
Hmm.

06:24.960 --> 06:29.160
You say autonomy in general, meaning other types of vehicles beyond aircraft?

06:29.160 --> 06:30.160
Yeah.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.160
Yeah, absolutely.

06:31.160 --> 06:36.800
We've looked at some things like some obviously ground robots, some surface vehicles,

06:36.800 --> 06:42.120
like autonomous boats here, but in general, a lot of the times where we've historically

06:42.120 --> 06:47.600
been interested in the algorithms that are running on these systems here, and a lot

06:47.600 --> 06:52.200
of the times the autonomy aspect or the algorithm that you're running, you know, it doesn't

06:52.200 --> 06:56.400
have to be flying on an aircraft, you know, you're trying to do some path planning through

06:56.400 --> 07:02.440
a complicated environment, or you're trying to build a map of an environment, and you

07:02.440 --> 07:06.400
could do that using an aircraft, or if it's more pertinent, you could do that with

07:06.400 --> 07:08.400
a ground vehicle or a surface vehicle.

07:08.400 --> 07:14.320
So our major focus in the past has really been developing the algorithms that would drive

07:14.320 --> 07:18.320
these vehicles or enable some sort of functionality.

07:18.320 --> 07:24.760
And the fact that it flies is almost more of a historical trend with our group is, you

07:24.760 --> 07:28.040
know, we've just been more comfortable with the aircraft and have a little bit more experience

07:28.040 --> 07:32.480
with the aircraft, but as I'm sure you're well aware of, and many of your other guests

07:32.480 --> 07:37.840
have talked about autonomy spreads out and is much larger than a particular vehicle that

07:37.840 --> 07:39.920
you're happy to be using.

07:39.920 --> 07:47.800
You mentioned boats and, and I mentioned or we mentioned Boeing, Boeing, I think earlier

07:47.800 --> 07:54.840
this year purchased a company that was doing, like unmanned underwater vehicles for sea

07:54.840 --> 07:55.840
exploration.

07:55.840 --> 08:00.200
Did you ever come across that acquisition, or are you familiar with that company?

08:00.200 --> 08:06.720
I am not familiar with that particular company or application that you mentioned, but, you

08:06.720 --> 08:11.440
know, there are faculty here at the UW that have looked at underwater vehicles.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.840
In fact, that's, that's a major research focus here at UW.

08:15.840 --> 08:22.280
There's a vehicle called a sea glider and it's an underwater vehicle and basically it

08:22.280 --> 08:25.160
operates by changing its buoyancy.

08:25.160 --> 08:29.640
So sometimes if you're trying to dive, it is a little bit heavier than water and then

08:29.640 --> 08:33.280
it has an internal bladder which can change its buoyancy to be a little bit lighter than

08:33.280 --> 08:34.280
water.

08:34.280 --> 08:39.520
It's got wings on the outside of it and you can imagine as this thing is descending

08:39.520 --> 08:47.000
through the, the water column, it can effectively glide as it's descending and as it comes

08:47.000 --> 08:50.760
back up, you basically just change the buoyancy to be a little bit lighter than water and

08:50.760 --> 08:52.760
now it just glides in the opposite direction.

08:52.760 --> 08:56.200
So now you're gaining altitude or getting closer to the surface, but you're basically

08:56.200 --> 08:58.240
able to affect forward motion with this.

08:58.240 --> 09:01.920
So there's been a couple of groups of the University of Washington that have been very

09:01.920 --> 09:07.440
interested in the underwater robotic side of things, using things like the sea glider

09:07.440 --> 09:09.880
or custom made hardware as well.

09:09.880 --> 09:10.880
Okay.

09:10.880 --> 09:17.280
So what are some of the major challenges in the areas that you're focused on?

09:17.280 --> 09:20.960
You know, things you mentioned path planning and some others.

09:20.960 --> 09:25.960
Well, yeah, there, I guess that's really an interesting question because in this space

09:25.960 --> 09:30.440
there's, there's a lot of, as you mentioned, different challenges and right now I would

09:30.440 --> 09:33.360
almost bend these into two different buckets.

09:33.360 --> 09:37.200
There's obviously some of these technical challenges that people are interested in right

09:37.200 --> 09:42.200
now, like doing detect and avoid, right, where an aircraft would be able to find another

09:42.200 --> 09:47.400
aircraft and de-conflict and avoid a collision.

09:47.400 --> 09:52.160
There's technical challenges like that, but one of the almost bigger problems or obstacles,

09:52.160 --> 09:55.880
well, maybe obstacles are wrong or maybe we should just keep using the word challenge,

09:55.880 --> 10:03.400
but it is one of a regulatory one, the regulatory environment and the US right now is not the

10:03.400 --> 10:09.720
most conducive to conducting cutting edge research with unmanned aircraft, but it's definitely

10:09.720 --> 10:10.840
getting better here.

10:10.840 --> 10:17.080
So if you want to talk about challenges, interestingly, probably more of the issues that we deal with

10:17.080 --> 10:22.680
right now trying to conduct research with unmanned aircraft is almost, we spend more time trying

10:22.680 --> 10:26.520
to deal with some of the regulatory issues than we do with the technical challenges right

10:26.520 --> 10:27.520
now.

10:27.520 --> 10:32.760
And what's your approach to that, is it, are you taking a research oriented approach to

10:32.760 --> 10:41.480
that or is it more of a traditional kind of advocacy lobbying, whatever the right terminology

10:41.480 --> 10:42.480
is there?

10:42.480 --> 10:50.120
Yeah, we kind of do a little bit of both here, obviously being a research group here,

10:50.120 --> 10:58.040
we do try to push a lot of these technical projects forward here from a pure basic research

10:58.040 --> 10:59.240
standpoint.

10:59.240 --> 11:04.240
But as you mentioned, the lobbying and the advocacy and the public perception is almost

11:04.240 --> 11:05.240
just as important.

11:05.240 --> 11:10.480
You know, UAS right now seem to be this very polarizing topic right now.

11:10.480 --> 11:14.760
You know, a lot of people love them, you know, people like you and I and probably the majority

11:14.760 --> 11:19.440
of the audience of people that listen to this podcast are, you know, very technologically

11:19.440 --> 11:20.440
savvy.

11:20.440 --> 11:26.120
They see the potential benefits here of unmanned aircraft and unmanned aerial systems.

11:26.120 --> 11:30.440
And really think that it's probably one of the next major revolutions in the aerospace

11:30.440 --> 11:31.440
industry.

11:31.440 --> 11:34.760
So you got that side of the fence, but then on the other side of the fence, you have

11:34.760 --> 11:39.880
a large chunk of the public right now that, you know, don't think that they're a good

11:39.880 --> 11:45.280
tool and perceive UAS as, you know, something that the government is going to use to invade

11:45.280 --> 11:46.280
your privacy here.

11:46.280 --> 11:51.640
So you have this polarizing space where you've got some people love it, some people hate

11:51.640 --> 11:52.640
it.

11:52.640 --> 11:56.440
So I think one of the jobs here, obviously, the people that are working in this space is

11:56.440 --> 12:01.760
probably to try to change the perception of some of the people that are a little bit negative

12:01.760 --> 12:05.920
or on the fence on these systems and show them that, you know, there really are a lot of

12:05.920 --> 12:09.720
positive applications for this type of technology right now.

12:09.720 --> 12:14.720
So advocacy is is a large part of the work right now, I think, in order to try to change

12:14.720 --> 12:23.240
that perception, I'd like to get to some of the details of the research specifically

12:23.240 --> 12:29.160
on the technology side, but just for sake of completeness, when you think of the positive

12:29.160 --> 12:35.280
benefits or more specifically, the positive use cases or applications, what are the things

12:35.280 --> 12:39.760
that you tell people to try to win them over?

12:39.760 --> 12:45.440
Yeah, the great question, you know, for maybe a little bit of historical background, you

12:45.440 --> 12:51.880
know, as you probably know, UAS have there pretty much an established history kind of coming

12:51.880 --> 12:53.400
from a military perspective.

12:53.400 --> 12:59.920
So a lot of the times you hear about stories of, you know, the military using these to conduct

12:59.920 --> 13:05.840
intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance or other types of operations, but nowadays

13:05.840 --> 13:11.280
the commercial and the civilian applications of these are really opening up here.

13:11.280 --> 13:16.360
So for example, one of the technical applications that I think is has a lot of promise here

13:16.360 --> 13:21.520
in the U.S. in the next several years here is this concept of precision agriculture.

13:21.520 --> 13:29.800
So the idea here is, can you use unmanned aerial systems to augment or help effectively

13:29.800 --> 13:31.800
agriculture and farming here?

13:31.800 --> 13:37.680
So for example, one of the projects we're working on right now is, you can maybe call it

13:37.680 --> 13:40.120
just an aerial mapping project here.

13:40.120 --> 13:43.880
That's kind of the large umbrella term that it falls under.

13:43.880 --> 13:47.600
It's a very popular one, maybe I'll preface that, you know, it seems like right now everybody

13:47.600 --> 13:52.800
and their dog wants to use an aircraft to try to provide some type of aerial map.

13:52.800 --> 13:57.320
So you know, we kind of wanted to jump on that bandwagon a little bit as well and we've

13:57.320 --> 14:03.080
done a couple of projects where yeah, we would like to use a aircraft or some kind of imaging

14:03.080 --> 14:08.440
system to gather large data sets here over a farm here.

14:08.440 --> 14:11.800
And the data that you gather is very interesting.

14:11.800 --> 14:17.120
You could do something simple like using a normal electro-optical camera to get your, you

14:17.120 --> 14:23.880
know, red-green blue channels of what does a farm look like from the visual, you know, optical

14:23.880 --> 14:26.200
range of sensors.

14:26.200 --> 14:31.160
And provide that information to a farmer, that's maybe the first layer here is, you know,

14:31.160 --> 14:36.580
you would have to take all of these images and stitch them together here to generate

14:36.580 --> 14:40.680
a high resolution orthomozic of some kind of area.

14:40.680 --> 14:45.440
And then, you know, maybe taking that one step further, there are other applications where

14:45.440 --> 14:50.160
you can put on different types of sensors like a multispectral imager that might be able

14:50.160 --> 14:56.120
to get you some of maybe the red edge or the near IR bands of radiation on that same

14:56.120 --> 14:57.120
area.

14:57.120 --> 15:02.600
And what you can actually do with that is people have been looking at things like a normalized

15:02.600 --> 15:06.200
difference vegetation index or an NDVI image.

15:06.200 --> 15:10.760
What this is is it's basically a plant health map.

15:10.760 --> 15:14.560
So what it will do is not just show you what does the farm look like from the air, but

15:14.560 --> 15:19.920
it can show you in this other, another perspective of that same farm.

15:19.920 --> 15:25.440
You can kind of get an idea of which plants are vigorous or healthy and maybe which areas

15:25.440 --> 15:29.000
of the farm are, could use a little bit more attention.

15:29.000 --> 15:35.160
So that's, that's obviously has a lot of potential applications to helping agronomists and

15:35.160 --> 15:40.280
farmers learn a little bit more about their crops and their products.

15:40.280 --> 15:48.000
So when I think about that application area, there are, and try to decompose it into different

15:48.000 --> 15:55.200
problems that one might apply machine learning in AI to, you know, there are certainly the,

15:55.200 --> 16:02.040
you talked a little bit about the sensors and, you know, there may be some ML and like

16:02.040 --> 16:06.040
stitching together, you know, creating these ortho mosaics and doing it.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.600
And I know there's, I forget the term.

16:08.600 --> 16:14.080
It's like, you know, essentially rectification, like correcting for earth curvature and

16:14.080 --> 16:21.480
other anomalies, maybe removing cloud cover or things like that across the, the, you

16:21.480 --> 16:31.480
know, different things aside from the sensor load and the various things related to, you

16:31.480 --> 16:32.960
know, the center data.

16:32.960 --> 16:37.840
And I guess the other big one is obviously the processing of the data and applying it

16:37.840 --> 16:44.880
to the use case like what do these images tell us about the health of the underlying agricultural

16:44.880 --> 16:45.880
system?

16:45.880 --> 16:52.880
It's strange that the, you know, in some ways, like the autonomous flight aspect of this,

16:52.880 --> 16:55.720
you know, might even, might be one of the easiest problems, right?

16:55.720 --> 17:03.280
At least if you separate out the collision avoidance thing, like, you know, even consumer

17:03.280 --> 17:11.000
drones, you could do, you could kind of lay out like a waypoint, a GPS waypoint grid,

17:11.000 --> 17:15.840
and just have the, the UAS follow that waypoint grid.

17:15.840 --> 17:20.920
And I guess this is really all a setup for like, what are all of the things that, you

17:20.920 --> 17:25.080
know, someone like me who's distant from this doesn't even think about that make it way

17:25.080 --> 17:29.880
more, you know, nuanced and complex than one might think.

17:29.880 --> 17:34.520
No, you bring up a lot of really good points there Sam. And in fact, I kind of wanted to

17:34.520 --> 17:40.440
dig in a little bit more on that last statement you made where, you know, the path, the flight

17:40.440 --> 17:45.040
planning and the actual execution of saying autonomous flight, you're right, that is kind

17:45.040 --> 17:46.040
of the boring part.

17:46.040 --> 17:48.840
That's a, that's kind of a solved problem at this point.

17:48.840 --> 17:53.520
It's a fairly mature technology, you know, just automating an aircraft to do some kind

17:53.520 --> 17:54.520
of emission.

17:54.520 --> 17:58.080
Right now, you know, we've got undergraduates in our lab right now, they go out and they

17:58.080 --> 18:04.240
buy a $200 little avionics platform, which is this open source hardware and software

18:04.240 --> 18:05.240
package.

18:05.240 --> 18:09.520
And you can integrate that onto a pretty much vanilla radio controlled aircraft.

18:09.520 --> 18:14.560
And you have yourself a quote unquote drone right now that you can tell it where you

18:14.560 --> 18:15.560
want it to fly.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.240
You can tell it how high you can tell it when to land.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.720
All of that is, is great here, right?

18:20.720 --> 18:21.720
And autonomy.

18:21.720 --> 18:22.720
Oh, sorry.

18:22.720 --> 18:26.240
You have to know, happen to know the name of that package, I'm sure folks might want

18:26.240 --> 18:27.240
to check it out.

18:27.240 --> 18:28.240
Oh, yeah.

18:28.240 --> 18:29.240
Absolutely.

18:29.240 --> 18:33.480
I mean, there's, there's a bunch of different ones you can find right now, but I think probably

18:33.480 --> 18:40.480
the, the most popular package at least for the introductory level of getting into UAS

18:40.480 --> 18:41.480
here.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.200
It's a system called a Pixhawk.

18:43.200 --> 18:44.200
Okay.

18:44.200 --> 18:49.240
And it's basically an Arduino based system here where you would load on the open source

18:49.240 --> 18:54.560
firmware packages called the, it's the Ardu pilot family of software.

18:54.560 --> 19:00.400
And that can do things from flying a plane or flying a multirotor or doing a ground robot.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.160
So it's really a lot of fun.

19:02.160 --> 19:07.440
It's sort of the, yeah, the Arduino package for doing unmanned systems here, building your

19:07.440 --> 19:09.160
own unmanned vehicle.

19:09.160 --> 19:13.920
It's a pretty easy way to get introduced to these systems.

19:13.920 --> 19:18.240
But you know, like we were talking about earlier, that's, that's sort of the easy part of

19:18.240 --> 19:19.240
this, right?

19:19.240 --> 19:21.560
It's, that's the solve portion of the problem here.

19:21.560 --> 19:27.880
So nowadays, unmanned aircraft and UAS, they're, they're really a means to an end, right?

19:27.880 --> 19:33.480
All you're trying to do in a lot of the, the research topics now is carry a, some sort

19:33.480 --> 19:34.480
of sensor, right?

19:34.480 --> 19:39.080
All you need here is that unmanned aircraft to take sensor somewhere that you want and take

19:39.080 --> 19:44.720
the data that you want and then doing something with that data or extracting the relevant information.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.360
That's where a lot of the research is right now.

19:47.360 --> 19:50.840
And that's maybe where some of the, you know, the machine learning and the AI that, you

19:50.840 --> 19:55.280
know, I'm sure you're very familiar with comes into play here for doing things like you're,

19:55.280 --> 19:58.240
you're mentioning the, the stitching of the photos together here.

19:58.240 --> 20:03.080
So in that sense, you know, I don't think we're necessarily a cutting edge developer

20:03.080 --> 20:04.080
of AI.

20:04.080 --> 20:09.080
We more use a couple of packages that will do the structure from motion and the photogrammetry

20:09.080 --> 20:12.680
and matching all the key points up together and stitching it together.

20:12.680 --> 20:16.560
That's, that's something that you can almost purchase off the shelf right now.

20:16.560 --> 20:21.120
And extracting the information like you mentioned and, and doing something with that information

20:21.120 --> 20:25.720
and having some kind of policy that you can act upon based on what you perceive.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.160
That's where it's a, a little bit more interesting right now.

20:28.160 --> 20:32.240
And I think that's probably a little bit more where, where some of the, the strategic

20:32.240 --> 20:34.240
level of research is going on right now.

20:34.240 --> 20:35.240
Okay.

20:35.240 --> 20:43.840
And is that how, you know, with a, a research group focused on unmanned aerial systems?

20:43.840 --> 20:48.600
Do you, does your group get involved in, in kind of that level of the discussion or is

20:48.600 --> 20:55.640
it primarily the, you know, kind of the infrastructure for autonomy?

20:55.640 --> 20:57.280
Can you expand a little bit on that?

20:57.280 --> 20:59.120
What, what do you mean?

20:59.120 --> 21:03.880
I think I know the answer to this based on the example that you gave, but the, you know,

21:03.880 --> 21:08.960
getting down to the application of, you know, say in precision agriculture like it,

21:08.960 --> 21:16.360
is your research and your, your group's research interests going down to the application

21:16.360 --> 21:24.240
itself and some of the, those areas or is it more on the, you know, the platform and

21:24.240 --> 21:29.440
the autonomous flight, some of this, you know, given that the, you know, that there's

21:29.440 --> 21:34.240
a base level of capability that's well established and commoditized.

21:34.240 --> 21:40.440
There are also, I imagine, you know, kind of various, there's a frontier there somewhere

21:40.440 --> 21:48.360
that might be, you know, object to void ends or it might be, you know, maybe it's, you

21:48.360 --> 21:53.360
know, incorporating variability like, how do you update your, your mapping grid with,

21:53.360 --> 21:59.520
you know, with, if it's very windy or something like that and, you know, or, I saw on your

21:59.520 --> 22:04.200
website, you talk about like, swarming behaviors and things like that, do you tend to focus

22:04.200 --> 22:09.880
out at that, you know, these kind of infrastructural or platform kinds of things or, you know,

22:09.880 --> 22:15.200
as your group in particular, also kind of, you know, focusing on these application level

22:15.200 --> 22:16.200
questions.

22:16.200 --> 22:18.520
Yeah, I think I see what you're saying.

22:18.520 --> 22:22.520
And my answer might not be the most satisfying here.

22:22.520 --> 22:27.880
You know, our group, I don't want to say tends to be scattered here, but we do have multiple

22:27.880 --> 22:34.160
different projects looking at kind of different aspects of, of autonomy in general here.

22:34.160 --> 22:39.360
And I will preface all of this by a lot of it is driven by the student initiative here.

22:39.360 --> 22:43.520
So if some students have a project that they're very interested in, we do as much as we

22:43.520 --> 22:47.520
possibly can to support that and enable that type of research.

22:47.520 --> 22:53.720
So that might be one of the reasons why we, we do look at a kind of a wider spectrum,

22:53.720 --> 23:00.320
almost, almost a breadth for a search rather than a depth for search in some of these topics

23:00.320 --> 23:01.320
here.

23:01.320 --> 23:04.240
So we are very interested in some of the applications here.

23:04.240 --> 23:08.480
So going back to that precision agriculture discussion that we talked about, I think

23:08.480 --> 23:12.760
you put it exactly right when you said that some of these components are commoditized

23:12.760 --> 23:14.880
and readily available.

23:14.880 --> 23:20.760
So a lot of the workflow that we mentioned earlier about planning a flight plan, generating

23:20.760 --> 23:26.240
the, or obtaining all these pictures, stitching them together, that is also fairly mature.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.640
You can buy a lot of packages to do that.

23:28.640 --> 23:32.600
Now the question would be, what do you do with that information when you have it back?

23:32.600 --> 23:38.160
So that's where I think some of the, the frontier that you mentioned is happening right now.

23:38.160 --> 23:43.440
So it's, it's one thing to be able to tell a farmer, here's what your farm looks like

23:43.440 --> 23:46.800
from a NDBI or from a health perspective.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.520
What do you now do with that information?

23:48.520 --> 23:53.880
So one of the things that we've looked at in the past is what's been done historically?

23:53.880 --> 23:57.160
Well, what do farmers do if they have a problem in their farm?

23:57.160 --> 23:59.640
Well, they'll go higher, say a crop duster, right?

23:59.640 --> 24:05.200
And I'm sure you've seen crop dusting aircraft before, there are these biplanes or, you

24:05.200 --> 24:11.640
know, low wing aircraft, which have 500 gallons of effectively toxic chemicals, right?

24:11.640 --> 24:16.240
And then they would go carpet bomb the entire farm to make sure they got an even application

24:16.240 --> 24:18.160
of this everywhere, right?

24:18.160 --> 24:20.720
So that's one way to approach a problem, right?

24:20.720 --> 24:25.720
But if you had more information like say you were able to send out a, a surveying drone

24:25.720 --> 24:30.080
or a multiple surveying drones to get this information about where on your farm actually

24:30.080 --> 24:34.520
needs this, well, then you might be able to do a more surgical application of some of

24:34.520 --> 24:37.240
this pesticides, herbicides, what have you.

24:37.240 --> 24:42.240
So we've actually in the past, we've developed a automatic crop dusting aircraft here.

24:42.240 --> 24:48.080
So it's a small, you know, about six foot wingspan aircraft, which has about a liter of

24:48.080 --> 24:49.840
aerosolized payload.

24:49.840 --> 24:54.480
So some students were looking at would you be able to use this in conjunction with some

24:54.480 --> 25:00.360
of this data that you get from the mapping side of things to now touch up areas of your

25:00.360 --> 25:06.960
farm instead of using a carpet bomb, you know, policy, could you use one or more of these

25:06.960 --> 25:12.480
aircraft to deploy and just hit the areas that you need to in your farm?

25:12.480 --> 25:18.240
So that's maybe one of the application levels, but we also look at some of these, these,

25:18.240 --> 25:22.720
the regulatory and more of the larger platform issues because, you know, as we just talked

25:22.720 --> 25:26.920
about there, it's, you, you have to build some platform, you know, the off, you usually

25:26.920 --> 25:31.840
have to do some hardware to enable some of this, these ideas that you want to do.

25:31.840 --> 25:36.680
So that's one thing I think that makes our group a little bit unique here is that we

25:36.680 --> 25:42.080
do have a lot of people that are very interested in spending time, getting their hands dirty,

25:42.080 --> 25:47.080
building some specialized hardware, conducting flight tests, things like that, rather than

25:47.080 --> 25:51.120
just doing the simulation in the lab and making sure that it works.

25:51.120 --> 25:53.120
We actually want to go out and fly it.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.120
Hmm.

25:54.120 --> 26:01.120
The precision crop dusting application sounds really difficult, like I'm wondering, can

26:01.120 --> 26:09.400
you, can you share the, the specific results of the research, like when I think about the

26:09.400 --> 26:15.960
issues that go into that in particular that on the, you know, chemical delivery side,

26:15.960 --> 26:24.200
we've got this, you know, this, you know, targeted aerosol that you're trying to deliver.

26:24.200 --> 26:28.440
It sounds, yeah, I'm imagining that you'd have to fly pretty low in order to deliver it.

26:28.440 --> 26:32.960
And then you have all the turbulence and air effects off of your vehicle that's going

26:32.960 --> 26:34.440
to scatter your aerosol.

26:34.440 --> 26:36.800
Like, how does that even work?

26:36.800 --> 26:40.440
Or how well did it work?

26:40.440 --> 26:46.440
You, again, have a real knack for asking the exact questions that I think need to be

26:46.440 --> 26:47.680
asked here.

26:47.680 --> 26:51.600
So there are a lot of challenges associated with it.

26:51.600 --> 26:57.440
So one of them that you mentioned right away here is the fact that you need to be fairly

26:57.440 --> 27:01.160
low to have an effective dispersal of these systems here.

27:01.160 --> 27:07.760
So some of the students did have to look into some technologies like automatic terrain avoidance

27:07.760 --> 27:12.640
here, so you need to be able to maintain a very specific altitude above the ground level.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.520
We didn't get a chance to actually test that too extensively.

27:15.520 --> 27:20.240
We went out and the farm we flew this at luckily was fairly completely flat.

27:20.240 --> 27:23.880
And they actually had just mowed all the grass the day before.

27:23.880 --> 27:31.520
So it was, it worked in, but again, I don't think we stressed the system very much there.

27:31.520 --> 27:35.920
The other thing that was very difficult with this project and it maybe segues into some

27:35.920 --> 27:39.640
of the other research we've done here is if you think about it, when you have this farm

27:39.640 --> 27:46.640
where certain spots on your farm might have the need for application of the pesticide or

27:46.640 --> 27:51.160
the payload and others don't, you basically wind up with the large traveling salesman

27:51.160 --> 27:52.160
problem, right?

27:52.160 --> 27:56.360
You've got this spatial grid here, but then you have only certain locations you need to

27:56.360 --> 27:57.360
visit.

27:57.360 --> 28:01.760
And then you only have one vehicle with a certain amount of payload that has certain constraints.

28:01.760 --> 28:05.200
So effectively it turns into a traveling salesman problem.

28:05.200 --> 28:08.800
And then if you want to scale this up, you know, we were talking about the vehicle only

28:08.800 --> 28:10.480
has about a liter of payload.

28:10.480 --> 28:15.080
Well, I don't think a farmer wants to be out there all day, you know, shooting one liter

28:15.080 --> 28:19.480
of payload, having it land, refill it, exactly going back out again.

28:19.480 --> 28:26.080
So maybe scaling this up to a swarm of vehicles where you could have multiple of these aircraft

28:26.080 --> 28:29.840
going out and doing this might cut down on the amount of time necessary to do this.

28:29.840 --> 28:35.560
But now instead of a one dimensional traveling salesman person, you have like an agents that

28:35.560 --> 28:38.520
you want to do traveling salesman with effectively.

28:38.520 --> 28:41.480
And that's, that's can be kind of challenging.

28:41.480 --> 28:47.320
So some other projects in the past that our groups look that have been maybe trying to tackle

28:47.320 --> 28:53.160
some of these problems using evolutionary computation and algorithms, I believe you had a guest

28:53.160 --> 28:58.280
in the past from maybe from UT Austin talking a little bit about this, maybe from the financial

28:58.280 --> 29:02.880
website of things, but that was restore make a line in OK, right, right, right.

29:02.880 --> 29:06.800
I remember hearing one of them, that was a really good podcast.

29:06.800 --> 29:10.200
And I kept trying to think about what were some of the parallels to maybe some of the

29:10.200 --> 29:15.040
evolutionary, evolutionary algorithms that we would apply here for unmanned aircraft.

29:15.040 --> 29:18.600
And this is a, this is one of the places where it would work here.

29:18.600 --> 29:23.400
You know, you mentioned you have multiple aircraft or multiple agents and then you have environmental

29:23.400 --> 29:24.400
problems.

29:24.400 --> 29:27.600
I think earlier we were talking a little bit about what if you have wind, what if you

29:27.600 --> 29:34.080
have turbulence, if your environment is complicated, it's, it gets a little bit interesting.

29:34.080 --> 29:41.160
So one approach that I think has gained has yielded some reasonable results here is trying

29:41.160 --> 29:47.040
to do the path and the task planning using evolutionary computation rather than say traditional

29:47.040 --> 29:48.360
optimization techniques.

29:48.360 --> 29:49.360
OK.

29:49.360 --> 29:56.960
You mentioned swarms of vehicles, you know, this is also something that's been researched

29:56.960 --> 30:02.160
at least theoretically, I don't, I think we're a lot closer to application now with, you

30:02.160 --> 30:07.960
know, these small inexpensive vehicles than previously, but I, you know, I think some

30:07.960 --> 30:15.760
of this stuff goes back to the 70s, even maybe or what, what kind of things that you looked

30:15.760 --> 30:21.960
at or what had the research results been of the year, different forays and to this,

30:21.960 --> 30:26.000
like for the precision agriculture, like how far did you get with that?

30:26.000 --> 30:29.680
And, you know, what were, how did you formulate the problems?

30:29.680 --> 30:34.720
Well, you know, I definitely don't want to claim to be an expert in this arena by, by

30:34.720 --> 30:38.240
any means, but I mean, I'm happy to talk about some of the things that we've, we've done

30:38.240 --> 30:45.680
in the past, maybe going back to that evolutionary computation example, that was a project which

30:45.680 --> 30:50.520
had multiple vehicles involved in it and, and maybe you could call it a swarm.

30:50.520 --> 30:54.600
I guess the terminology swarm seems to have different contexts and different meetings

30:54.600 --> 30:58.320
depending on who you're talking about here, but from our perspective, maybe we would

30:58.320 --> 31:04.440
think about this as just multiple vehicles, trying to achieve some kind of common goal.

31:04.440 --> 31:10.560
So in the past, we've done things like searching with multiple vehicles.

31:10.560 --> 31:16.800
So we have a cooperative group of vehicles or in your team and you need to spread out

31:16.800 --> 31:22.320
and search a potentially spatially complex environment here, which might have obstacles

31:22.320 --> 31:27.200
from which might have danger zones or might have regions that you don't want to be in.

31:27.200 --> 31:32.800
So we looked at trying to apply multiple vehicles in these scenarios here rather than just

31:32.800 --> 31:39.560
a single vehicle and, you know, searching with multiple vehicles is by no means a new topic.

31:39.560 --> 31:42.880
As you mentioned, this has probably been from the 70s or earlier.

31:42.880 --> 31:49.680
I think a lot of the early work with, I believe Alberto Elves did a lot of work in occupancy

31:49.680 --> 31:53.640
grids and occupancy based maps back in the 80s here.

31:53.640 --> 31:58.480
And we sort of tried to extend some of that work here to using multiple aircraft to search

31:58.480 --> 32:00.680
an area cooperatively.

32:00.680 --> 32:06.280
So that might be one aspect where you might consider this to be a swarm application, although

32:06.280 --> 32:11.840
in that sense, the vehicles, they were not actually tightly coupled together.

32:11.840 --> 32:17.760
They were more cooperatively interacting with one another.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.760
So that was one application, I guess, where you have multiple vehicles.

32:20.760 --> 32:25.680
We've done other projects here where you tried to have a more rigidly structured swarm.

32:25.680 --> 32:30.920
So we did some work with Boeing a little while ago where we wanted to have a dynamically

32:30.920 --> 32:33.320
reconfigurable formation.

32:33.320 --> 32:38.600
So the idea would be you have a formation of vehicles either in a line or a diamond

32:38.600 --> 32:41.120
or some kind of configuration here.

32:41.120 --> 32:43.880
And for the most part, that's usually fine and dandy.

32:43.880 --> 32:48.520
You can go flying around in the atmosphere with this formation and maintain its structure

32:48.520 --> 32:49.520
no problem.

32:49.520 --> 32:56.360
But you've got people now talking about trying to do urban navigation like in cities.

32:56.360 --> 33:00.920
And you can imagine now you've got constraints, you've got obstacles.

33:00.920 --> 33:07.800
So this swarm needs to be able to reconfigure itself and adapt to moving around these obstacles

33:07.800 --> 33:14.080
or maybe going through choke points like trying to get through a window or a narrow intersection.

33:14.080 --> 33:20.600
So we looked at some of that work there with multiple vehicles and swarms here.

33:20.600 --> 33:25.920
When you're looking at these multi-vehicle problems, whether it's this formation flying

33:25.920 --> 33:36.040
problem or formation missions or the group search, what are some of the approaches or algorithms

33:36.040 --> 33:38.320
that come in the play?

33:38.320 --> 33:45.280
Yeah, that's a good one because right now it seems like a lot of the research is focused

33:45.280 --> 33:51.960
on sort of decentralized algorithms which are able to scale well.

33:51.960 --> 33:58.360
So the idea there would be you try to communicate with your nearest neighbors or using some type

33:58.360 --> 34:03.200
of graph topology to determine communication and how these vehicles interact.

34:03.200 --> 34:07.960
And I think one of the reasons that gained a lot of traction here is because it's somewhat

34:07.960 --> 34:09.200
scalable here, right?

34:09.200 --> 34:14.520
If you have a somewhat decentralized algorithm where you don't need information from everybody

34:14.520 --> 34:19.040
else in your team, you only need information from certain vehicles.

34:19.040 --> 34:24.400
That tends to be a little bit more scalable than say a centralized or some all-to-all communication

34:24.400 --> 34:30.440
topology where the communications costs and the scaling costs just exponentially increase

34:30.440 --> 34:31.640
with a number of vehicles.

34:31.640 --> 34:38.560
So if you want to do a large number of these, a decentralized approach might have a lot

34:38.560 --> 34:42.840
of interesting advantages here.

34:42.840 --> 34:48.040
That being said, some of the things that we've looked at particularly in the past here has

34:48.040 --> 34:52.840
actually been a little bit more heuristic or a little bit more rules-based.

34:52.840 --> 34:58.760
I think it's really great to be able to talk about scaling this to 50, 100, 200 vehicles,

34:58.760 --> 35:05.880
but in reality, the state of the technology is at such a level here that I think you'd

35:05.880 --> 35:10.760
be lucky if you can get five vehicles cooperating together simultaneously.

35:10.760 --> 35:19.840
So right now, we've personally been focusing a little bit more on the rule-based or the

35:19.840 --> 35:25.640
heuristics or the centralized type of algorithm to coordinate multiple vehicles.

35:25.640 --> 35:32.000
So that search work that we talked about earlier, it was basically you have this star topology

35:32.000 --> 35:36.160
where everybody communicates with a centralized coordinator.

35:36.160 --> 35:40.600
Not every single agent needs to talk to every other agent, but every agent needs to be connected

35:40.600 --> 35:48.040
to a centralized coordinator to allow each vehicle to compute what it thinks is the optimal

35:48.040 --> 35:50.120
path for it to take next.

35:50.120 --> 35:56.440
But that is the calculation of the optimal path to take next is done by the vehicle itself

35:56.440 --> 36:01.480
as opposed to the coordinator centrally determining that and just giving the vehicle a

36:01.480 --> 36:02.480
flight path.

36:02.480 --> 36:03.480
Correct.

36:03.480 --> 36:04.480
Correct.

36:04.480 --> 36:08.240
So the vehicles would be able to make their own decisions here, although it does rely

36:08.240 --> 36:12.520
on information or inputs from the centralized coordinator.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.800
And the coordinator rule can change.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.040
It doesn't necessarily need to be a ground station.

36:17.040 --> 36:21.840
It could be one of the vehicles, but as long as you have a central agent or some kind

36:21.840 --> 36:26.160
of clearinghouse that would have some information that all the other vehicles need, that's what

36:26.160 --> 36:30.880
we were using to make some of these systems like the searching or the evolutionary path

36:30.880 --> 36:32.080
planning work.

36:32.080 --> 36:36.960
And is that central coordinator or the central information?

36:36.960 --> 36:43.600
Is that just state or is there also, are there any elements that need to be centrally

36:43.600 --> 36:44.600
computed?

36:44.600 --> 36:47.240
I guess it would depend on the application.

36:47.240 --> 36:52.120
So for example, like the searching application where we had this environment and you wanted

36:52.120 --> 36:58.080
to send out a swarm of vehicles to find some kind of target, like a lost hiker or a boat,

36:58.080 --> 37:03.440
something like that, the information that the coordinator maintained would be a map

37:03.440 --> 37:04.760
or the state of the world.

37:04.760 --> 37:05.760
So you're right.

37:05.760 --> 37:09.920
In some sense, it would have some state here that the vehicles could that have access

37:09.920 --> 37:15.880
to to make their own independent decisions on what to do next here.

37:15.880 --> 37:20.480
In the case of the evolutionary path planning here, the idea with that was, you know, you

37:20.480 --> 37:26.880
would have multiple vehicles trying to achieve some type of team-based goal here.

37:26.880 --> 37:34.040
And to do that, each vehicle needed to compute its own flight path to achieve something.

37:34.040 --> 37:39.920
And what the centralized coordinator did would be able to look at every vehicle, effectively

37:39.920 --> 37:42.040
made a bid on a task here.

37:42.040 --> 37:47.920
They would say based on my tactics, based on my capabilities, based on my constraints,

37:47.920 --> 37:52.680
in order for me to execute a certain task, I think it's going to cost me X amount of

37:52.680 --> 37:56.080
whatever the metric is, fuel, time, money.

37:56.080 --> 38:01.600
And then the coordinator would then be able to effectively act as like an option, an open

38:01.600 --> 38:03.080
market, like a free market.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.080
Right.

38:04.080 --> 38:07.040
Now, the coordinator would be able to pick and assign tasks to the vehicle that could

38:07.040 --> 38:13.520
do that for not necessarily the cheapest individually, but the cheapest for the entire

38:13.520 --> 38:14.520
team, right?

38:14.520 --> 38:18.720
So the coordinator would be able to assess and evaluate who needs to do what so that the

38:18.720 --> 38:22.520
overall team could achieve the mission.

38:22.520 --> 38:23.520
Mm-hmm.

38:23.520 --> 38:31.880
It strikes me that in that case, you run into potential like local optima type problems

38:31.880 --> 38:40.160
or, you know, the cost is potentially highly dependent on like the time horizon and the

38:40.160 --> 38:45.560
sequence of tasks that each of the vehicles takes on, did you look into that aspect of

38:45.560 --> 38:46.560
it?

38:46.560 --> 38:47.560
Yes.

38:47.560 --> 38:48.560
You're absolutely right.

38:48.560 --> 38:54.000
And I think, again, I by no means want to claim to be an expert or even well versed

38:54.000 --> 39:00.160
in this, but evolution of algorithms and any kind of optimization in some of this very

39:00.160 --> 39:04.960
complicated problems here are always probably subject to some type of local minima here

39:04.960 --> 39:11.560
that in for a complicated system can be very difficult to assess, you know, yeah, is this

39:11.560 --> 39:12.560
a local minima?

39:12.560 --> 39:13.560
Is this a global minima?

39:13.560 --> 39:17.160
How are we doing relative to what else options are out there?

39:17.160 --> 39:20.720
So you definitely could fall into that trap.

39:20.720 --> 39:27.240
One thing that made this system unique here is, you know, you mentioned this idea of given

39:27.240 --> 39:32.200
the amount of time that you have to compute or whatever your horizon was, one feature

39:32.200 --> 39:37.200
that we really wanted to bake into this evolutionary path planning system that was developed

39:37.200 --> 39:42.000
here was the concept of feasibility here over optimality.

39:42.000 --> 39:47.640
So you can probably imagine if you have aircraft flying around, it's great if you were able

39:47.640 --> 39:51.200
to have some sort of what you would call a optimal flight path.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.200
That's great.

39:52.200 --> 39:56.160
But if it takes you three hours to compute an optimal flight path, that might not be so

39:56.160 --> 39:59.280
great if you have actual aircraft in the air, right?

39:59.280 --> 40:00.280
Right.

40:00.280 --> 40:03.880
It's kind of like having the space shuttle and you want to reboot the computer here and

40:03.880 --> 40:05.480
have everyone hold their breath, right?

40:05.480 --> 40:07.520
You probably don't want to do that.

40:07.520 --> 40:12.880
So instead, feasibility is almost more important than optimality, right?

40:12.880 --> 40:16.400
Each of these vehicles need to be able to have a feasible flight path and at least something

40:16.400 --> 40:19.720
they can do and execute at any given moment.

40:19.720 --> 40:24.720
So what we wanted to do is make sure that the evolutionary algorithm only sort of considered

40:24.720 --> 40:28.160
feasible trajectories or solutions at any given point.

40:28.160 --> 40:34.440
So you might think of this as some type of interior point method from a larger optimization

40:34.440 --> 40:35.440
standpoint.

40:35.440 --> 40:39.120
But that I think was something that made that a little bit interesting and unique here

40:39.120 --> 40:44.120
because optimality wasn't as highly prized as feasibility.

40:44.120 --> 40:49.360
And I guess if you think about it long enough, optimality is by definition it's subjective,

40:49.360 --> 40:50.360
right?

40:50.360 --> 40:54.160
It's whatever cost function or utility function, you decide it to cook up and decide

40:54.160 --> 40:59.200
to apply to the scenario, who's to say there isn't a better optimality function or cost

40:59.200 --> 41:01.240
function somewhere else.

41:01.240 --> 41:06.920
So in a lot of these cases, your constraints actually are more important than what you

41:06.920 --> 41:10.600
have decided as this utility function to apply.

41:10.600 --> 41:17.920
Oh, that's a really interesting way of thinking about it and something that something that

41:17.920 --> 41:21.720
probably gets lost in a lot of the conversations about optimizations.

41:21.720 --> 41:27.320
Did you look at, though, the feasibility cost, I guess, for lack of a better term?

41:27.320 --> 41:34.400
Like did you compare that to the optimal for a given cost function and try to get a sense

41:34.400 --> 41:41.200
for, you know, what was the cost of operating under fixed resource or time constraints?

41:41.200 --> 41:44.920
Gosh, you've got me in a corner there here.

41:44.920 --> 41:49.880
I don't recall the specific details here, but I'm going to have to punt a little bit

41:49.880 --> 41:51.680
on that and say, I don't believe that.

41:51.680 --> 41:57.640
If we actually did a law, an in-depth sensitivity study on that front.

41:57.640 --> 41:58.640
Okay.

41:58.640 --> 41:59.640
Great.

41:59.640 --> 42:05.920
So, for folks that are interested in learning more about this type of research, are there

42:05.920 --> 42:11.040
any particular, you've mentioned a couple of different projects that you've worked on

42:11.040 --> 42:16.840
are there specific papers that they can go and track down to learn more about the way

42:16.840 --> 42:18.680
you approach that problem?

42:18.680 --> 42:26.120
Yeah, absolutely. We have a couple of papers on our lab website here.

42:26.120 --> 42:29.600
Again, most of them are compartmentalized by these different projects that we're working

42:29.600 --> 42:30.600
on.

42:30.600 --> 42:35.680
So, yeah, please, or let me know, I'm happy to share projects or papers with anyone that's

42:35.680 --> 42:36.680
interested.

42:36.680 --> 42:42.560
Yeah, we'll definitely include links to the ones that we talked about.

42:42.560 --> 42:50.560
Hopefully, you can help us pull together a list of those as well as the website as a

42:50.560 --> 42:56.840
whole for folks that want to learn more about the field in general.

42:56.840 --> 43:02.040
Do you have any starting places that you tend to point people to?

43:02.040 --> 43:05.280
That's a really good question here.

43:05.280 --> 43:09.480
I guess it's even hard to define the field, right?

43:09.480 --> 43:14.480
That's exactly what I'm trying to think about right now is like we've had a really good

43:14.480 --> 43:20.280
discussion here about, there's the technical field for sure, things like the detective

43:20.280 --> 43:25.880
avoid or the path planning or the information processing on the data you return from these

43:25.880 --> 43:27.120
aircraft.

43:27.120 --> 43:33.080
That's definitely one exciting area of the field, but the ones that we're seeing a lot

43:33.080 --> 43:38.040
come out right now are there's a lot of interesting flight test and practical application

43:38.040 --> 43:42.360
and people actually going out and conducting experiments and gathering data with this.

43:42.360 --> 43:49.200
It's almost a branch of, I guess, the more mature sort of field robotics area, right?

43:49.200 --> 43:54.760
The aircraft I think in the US are now starting to be able to catch up to some of the field

43:54.760 --> 43:59.640
robotics that people have been conducting with ground robots and elsewhere for a long

43:59.640 --> 44:00.640
time.

44:00.640 --> 44:08.680
There's a lot of exciting details about that, so there's a couple of companies that we've

44:08.680 --> 44:13.680
worked with in the past that are actually conducting a lot of flight tests.

44:13.680 --> 44:20.640
You know, people in the University of Washington, over at UC Boulder, UT, or Texas A&M, there's

44:20.640 --> 44:24.240
a lot of different groups that are doing this type of work, so it's hard for me to point

44:24.240 --> 44:29.720
to one exact, I guess, paper that would be helpful.

44:29.720 --> 44:34.240
So yeah, I apologize, I probably don't have a specific reference to look at.

44:34.240 --> 44:40.000
And maybe let me ask like this, if you were talking to someone who was early in their

44:40.000 --> 44:47.560
research career and they asked you, you know, what are some specific kind of interesting

44:47.560 --> 44:53.280
problems that would be a good place to start to dig into, how would you advise them?

44:53.280 --> 44:55.720
Yeah, that's another good one.

44:55.720 --> 45:00.560
I guess at this point, where things are really interesting, at least from our perspective

45:00.560 --> 45:04.640
here, is we're doing a little bit of work right now.

45:04.640 --> 45:08.640
We're seeing a lot of interest in this idea of risk assessment of UAS.

45:08.640 --> 45:15.640
So if you're not sure on exactly what part of UAS you're interested in, risk assessment

45:15.640 --> 45:19.280
is actually an interesting way to take a look at this, because what's happening right

45:19.280 --> 45:26.800
now is a lot of people in order to gain waivers or the ability to conduct their operations

45:26.800 --> 45:32.000
with the under FAA jurisdiction need to provide some type of risk assessment showing that

45:32.000 --> 45:35.040
their operation is safe.

45:35.040 --> 45:39.080
And by doing that, by conducting this risk assessment, you're forced to sort of take

45:39.080 --> 45:45.640
an overall look at not just a specific technology on board and aircraft, but the entire flight

45:45.640 --> 45:48.960
operation envelope and operation in general.

45:48.960 --> 45:54.240
So you actually have to look at the end-to-end mission using a UAS.

45:54.240 --> 45:58.200
So that's your checklist, that's your area of operations.

45:58.200 --> 46:01.600
Then the technical aspects would be that's your platform and what kind of avionics you're

46:01.600 --> 46:03.360
running, what kind of control algorithms.

46:03.360 --> 46:09.440
So if you're able to understand the risk associated with the given UAS, that's a really

46:09.440 --> 46:15.040
good way to try to get a bird's eye view of what are some of the challenges and issues

46:15.040 --> 46:20.120
associated with UAS and the research that's going on with them right now.

46:20.120 --> 46:28.760
So we talked earlier about a software platform like Argypilot for a system like Argypilot,

46:28.760 --> 46:33.640
how would you go about conducting a risk assessment on that part of it?

46:33.640 --> 46:39.360
Does that involve detailed code path reviews?

46:39.360 --> 46:46.640
And are you trying to get to a, how do you even characterize the risk associated with

46:46.640 --> 46:48.080
that part of a system?

46:48.080 --> 46:50.440
Yeah, that's an excellent question here.

46:50.440 --> 46:55.760
And I think there might even be some parallels and some ways we can look at self-driving cars

46:55.760 --> 46:58.120
here as well.

46:58.120 --> 47:01.280
The risk assessment, there's multiple ways you can look at this.

47:01.280 --> 47:05.720
One is exactly like you mentioned here, you can look at a detailed low-level implementation

47:05.720 --> 47:11.320
of trying to characterize each component here associated with an aircraft, look at meantime

47:11.320 --> 47:18.200
between failures, try to calculate or estimate or some otherwise get a handle on the reliability

47:18.200 --> 47:19.440
of a given component, right?

47:19.440 --> 47:22.400
And you do that for one component, then you do it for another component, you do it for

47:22.400 --> 47:23.400
another component.

47:23.400 --> 47:28.600
And you can kind of see this also becomes, while it's very detailed, it's difficult to

47:28.600 --> 47:33.960
do this and scale this because I don't know if you just go into Google Images, right?

47:33.960 --> 47:38.840
You type a drone or unmanned aerial system and you look at the Images page, drones come

47:38.840 --> 47:45.280
in all sorts of different size, shapes, taxonomies, avionics, there's just so many different ways

47:45.280 --> 47:49.040
that you can configure an unmanned system that is really not standardized and trying to do

47:49.040 --> 47:54.040
that for any given system, pretty much becomes fairly intractable quickly.

47:54.040 --> 47:59.680
So the other way you can sort of look at assessing risk of a given UAS operation or emission

47:59.680 --> 48:06.480
is at a more macro level here, you can look at things like, how often do I expect this

48:06.480 --> 48:12.840
to collide with another vehicle here and try to do a larger level risk analysis?

48:12.840 --> 48:18.240
I mean, in fact, this is really interesting, we published a lot of technical papers here

48:18.240 --> 48:26.040
looking at things like path planning here or mapping or GPS to 9 navigation or things

48:26.040 --> 48:32.640
like that, but our most popular publication is actually looking at a model to assess the

48:32.640 --> 48:38.800
risk of a given UAS mission on a large level like what we were talking about just now.

48:38.800 --> 48:46.040
Because if you think about this, UAS are a very interesting new paradigm in terms of aviation

48:46.040 --> 48:47.040
safety.

48:47.040 --> 48:52.400
So historically, right, there's three parties or three entities you have to care about

48:52.400 --> 48:56.360
if you're flying an aircraft, right, you have to make sure that the A, the people on board

48:56.360 --> 49:00.840
your own aircraft are safe, B, you have to make sure people on board other aircraft are

49:00.840 --> 49:05.480
safe, and then C, you have to make sure that people on the ground, like these bystanders

49:05.480 --> 49:08.120
or pedestrians, that they're safe.

49:08.120 --> 49:13.080
And this is kind of very similar to self-driving car, right, self-driving car.

49:13.080 --> 49:14.080
It's the same thing.

49:14.080 --> 49:17.120
You've got to make sure that the person in the car is safe, people in other cars are safe,

49:17.120 --> 49:18.760
and pedestrians are safe.

49:18.760 --> 49:23.920
Now the unmanned aircraft, though, brings a interesting twist on this topic here, right,

49:23.920 --> 49:28.960
because historically, if you just make sure that your own people on board your own aircraft

49:28.960 --> 49:34.480
are safe, the other two categories follow directly, right, if my aircraft is safe, I probably

49:34.480 --> 49:37.400
won't hit other aircraft and I probably won't hit people on the ground here.

49:37.400 --> 49:43.800
So the implication of that is your aircraft needs to be extremely reliable and robust

49:43.800 --> 49:49.680
and safe, right, the airframe itself needs to be reliable, because if you ensure that,

49:49.680 --> 49:52.440
you ensure the other two parties are safe as well.

49:52.440 --> 49:56.040
And that's the exact same for a self-driving car, right, so I've heard of many of your guests

49:56.040 --> 50:01.080
previously talk about safety is important for self-driving cars, that really means, again,

50:01.080 --> 50:06.600
making sure that the vehicle itself, the self-driving car is safe and therefore won't

50:06.600 --> 50:08.240
endanger anyone else.

50:08.240 --> 50:13.200
Now with the aircraft, though, if you take out the person on board the first group, right,

50:13.200 --> 50:17.720
if you take off the people on board the aircraft, now you just have to worry about those other

50:17.720 --> 50:18.720
two categories.

50:18.720 --> 50:21.840
That's people and other aircraft and people on the ground.

50:21.840 --> 50:29.200
What that kind of does to you here is it means you can actually sort of have a semi-unreliable

50:29.200 --> 50:33.840
aircraft, as long as you make sure that it doesn't hit other aircraft and it doesn't

50:33.840 --> 50:39.200
hit other pedestrians on the ground here, right, so that's why I think you've seen a lot

50:39.200 --> 50:44.640
of these unmanned aircraft nowadays, they're not, they're nowhere near the level of reliability

50:44.640 --> 50:46.720
of a manned aircraft, right?

50:46.720 --> 50:53.840
Meantime between failures are fairly often, actually, you know, you have these lipopower,

50:53.840 --> 50:58.400
these battery powered, effectively souped up hobby aircraft, going out and doing these

50:58.400 --> 51:03.560
types of missions here and as long as you conduct them in, you know, like a remote enough

51:03.560 --> 51:08.120
area where you're not endangering those other two categories, you can probably conduct

51:08.120 --> 51:13.840
these type of operations in a perfectly safe manner here and still have the same level

51:13.840 --> 51:17.360
of reliability and safety as a manned operation.

51:17.360 --> 51:22.960
It just, it brings a slight paradigm shift to the idea of where these systems can be used.

51:22.960 --> 51:30.320
Which brings us full circle back to one of your opening points that regulation in particular

51:30.320 --> 51:41.200
and the overall perception of trustworthiness of these systems is a, you know, just as

51:41.200 --> 51:47.360
important as the technical bits and pieces in making, you know, making it all happen.

51:47.360 --> 51:48.360
Right.

51:48.360 --> 51:53.760
Yes, the regulatory compliance and making sure that the operation is safe, I think, is a

51:53.760 --> 51:58.800
huge portion of the research and the public perception associated with the UAS right

51:58.800 --> 51:59.800
now.

51:59.800 --> 52:01.960
Well, Chris, this has been a fascinating discussion.

52:01.960 --> 52:07.160
I appreciate you taking the time to share with us.

52:07.160 --> 52:09.760
Where can folks learn more about what you're up to?

52:09.760 --> 52:15.760
Oh, absolutely, we've, we've got a website and actually I'm almost kind of embarrassed

52:15.760 --> 52:18.760
to admit this here, but, you know, in this age of social media here, we've got a lot

52:18.760 --> 52:25.120
of very savvy students here in our lab who have set up a nice Facebook page as well for

52:25.120 --> 52:26.120
our group here.

52:26.120 --> 52:33.200
We've got, we've got those sort of environments in the, on the internet that people are absolutely

52:33.200 --> 52:38.080
welcome to check out and yeah, if anyone is near the University of Washington during this

52:38.080 --> 52:41.560
Seattle area, you know, I would invite them to swing by the lab, talk with us.

52:41.560 --> 52:47.000
We also have a flight testing facility near here where we fly every once in a while and

52:47.000 --> 52:51.960
we try to invite people that are interested to kind of come out and observe and maybe fly

52:51.960 --> 52:52.960
with us.

52:52.960 --> 52:57.880
Well, there's a, we would love to have any interaction with anybody in the area or else

52:57.880 --> 52:58.880
wise.

52:58.880 --> 52:59.880
Great.

52:59.880 --> 53:06.880
Well, I'll include a link to your page on the UW site and get with you about any other

53:06.880 --> 53:09.520
links that it would make sense to share.

53:09.520 --> 53:10.520
Oh, thank you.

53:10.520 --> 53:11.520
That would be great.

53:11.520 --> 53:12.520
Awesome.

53:12.520 --> 53:13.520
Well, thanks so much.

53:13.520 --> 53:14.520
I appreciate it.

53:14.520 --> 53:15.760
No, thank you so much for having us.

53:15.760 --> 53:17.520
It's been a real honor to be here.

53:17.520 --> 53:19.520
