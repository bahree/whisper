00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:31,080
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,520
In today's episode, I'm joined by Zach Costello, host doctoral fellow at the Joint Bioenergy

5
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,360
Institute.

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,280
Zach joined me to discuss his recent paper, a machine learning approach to predict metabolic

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,160
pathway dynamics from time series multiomics data.

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,320
In our conversation, we start with an overview of synthetic biology and from there dig into

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,480
Zach's particular application, which is the use of ML techniques to optimize metabolic

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,080
reactions for engineering biofuels at scale.

11
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:07,360
We get into an interesting chat about biohacking as well at the end of our interview.

12
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,280
It turns out it's pretty easy for hobbyists to get started in this type of work, which

13
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,240
is pretty wild.

14
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,320
For the interview, remember that the next Twimble online meetup is coming up next Tuesday.

15
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,880
Nick Teague will lead a discussion on the paper Quantum Machine Learning, which explores

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,760
creating quantum software for machine learning tasks.

17
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,600

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,240
Enjoy.

19
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:40,840
Alright everyone, I am on the line with Zach Costello.

20
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,840
Zach is a postdoctoral fellow at the Joint Bioenergy Institute.

21
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,280
Zach, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

22
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,440
Hi, happy to be here.

23
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,400
Why don't we get started by having you tell us a little bit about your background and

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,800
how it led you to working on machine learning?

25
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,800
Absolutely, yeah.

26
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,520
So I'm a researcher whose goal is to sort of advance the transition of biology into an

27
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,040
engineering discipline.

28
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:11,520
I spend my time solving challenging problems in synthetic biology where I apply a various

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,600
set of skills that I've developed over my education, like machine learning, control theory,

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,960
applied mathematics more generally, and robotic automation.

31
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:27,280
My work is kind of situated in between biological theory and practice so that the techniques

32
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,600
I develop can be validated by either me or my colleagues in the lab.

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,440
And whenever I undertake a project, the goal is to sort of advance the idea of creating

34
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,560
a world where organisms can be engineered predictably, rapidly, and at low cost.

35
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,160
In terms of my education, I started out actually as an electrical engineer where I focused

36
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,720
on electromagnetics as an undergraduate.

37
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,680
And then I took a position in between that at the Georgia Tech Research Institute where

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:03,120
I kind of did a little bit of biological application and I started to get into some sort, some

39
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,720
classification problems involving that.

40
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,160
But for me, during my education, one of the guiding principles was to sort of pick the

41
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,600
best teacher over the coolest problem so I could learn as much as possible and as deeply

42
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
as possible.

43
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,920
I figure there's like fascinating problems everywhere.

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,600
And so, you know, in that vein, I kind of did a little bit of a switch up for my PhD and

45
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:29,040
was in a swarm robotics lab under my advisor, Magnus Agerstead, who is just an excellent

46
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,760
teacher and the theoretical focus in the lab there was a network control theory.

47
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,800
And my PhD was focused on studying what a certain class of network dynamical systems could

48
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,640
compute.

49
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,120
And the fundamental question here was how do you do computation when you actually don't

50
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,840
have any leaders in charge of it?

51
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,200
So there's no single thing orchestrating it.

52
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,280
And there are certain places computers can't go, but they still have to process information

53
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,120
and react to complex environments.

54
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:00,440
So in some sense, even then, I had biological applications in mind.

55
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,200
And one particular example I was always thinking about is how cells can coordinate to compute.

56
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,200
And I figured once I finished my doctorate, though I either need to start working in biology

57
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,360
or I'd never really find my way in.

58
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:16,440
So for my postdoc, I made the transition into synthetic biology and I'm doing my postdoc

59
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,920
now at the Joint Bioenergy Institute in the quantitative metabolic modeling group under

60
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:25,560
Dr. Hector Garcia Martin, who has been an excellent advocate for the integration of mathematics,

61
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,600
machine learning and automation and synthetic biology where it's still pretty nascent.

62
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,040
And this is where I actually started doing my work formally in machine learning.

63
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,560
I picked up machine learning as the way to speed up the rate at which I could deal with

64
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,520
the complex subject of synthetic biology because I did not have a biological background.

65
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,760
I work with really talented chemical engineers and biochemists and I just won't be able

66
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,720
to compete for probably another few years on raw biological knowledge.

67
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,480
So for me, the machine learning provided a way of handling some of that complexity and

68
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,880
giving me the ability to contribute where I was still developing skills.

69
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,360
So I love that.

70
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,960
I often, you know, in talking to people about machine learning and AI, refer to it as

71
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,040
a superpower that eventually gives folks who wielded a tremendous advantage and your

72
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,640
story is kind of a great example of that.

73
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:21,480
Tell us a little bit more about synthetic bio and what are the kinds of problems you're

74
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,480
working on there.

75
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,800
Yeah, absolutely.

76
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:30,040
So the way I think about it is when any science becomes sufficiently mature, it sort of

77
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:34,080
births a corresponding engineering discipline.

78
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,720
And so in this case, biology has accumulated a lot of different knowledge over the years

79
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,280
and these are sort of in the form of individual properties of different parts of biology.

80
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,120
And synthetic biology is maybe just a rebranding of genetic engineering, but the aim is to make

81
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,480
biological systems predictably engineerable so that you can solve an array of human challenges.

82
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:02,480
And for me specifically, I work in sort of a sub discipline of that called metabolic engineering.

83
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:07,080
And in metabolic engineering, we aim to add reactions to metabolisms, to make molecules

84
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,040
that are useful to people.

85
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,640
So some examples of those might be fuels, pharmaceuticals, or biomaterials, say spider

86
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,720
silk or plastics.

87
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,920
And maybe just to sort of, I think there's probably one key analogy that people can kind

88
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,880
of key in on to understand what's going on in the context of the conversation I think

89
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,640
we're likely to have going forward.

90
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,240
And so I think maybe one of your guests mentioned this before, the central dogma of biology

91
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,400
is kind of important here, which is DNA is transcribed into RNA, RNA is translated into

92
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,920
proteins.

93
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,760
In metabolic engineering, proteins are used to catalyze reactions and so we add reactions

94
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:49,360
to an organism to make new chemicals.

95
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:55,200
And sort of a good way to think about metabolism as a whole is say a subway system.

96
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,600
So if you imagine the subway system in the Bay area, each station would represent a particular

97
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,440
chemical that's present in the body for an important reason.

98
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,280
And then those are connected through tunnels between these stations.

99
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,760
So if you want to get from say San Francisco to Oakland, there might be a series of stops.

100
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,880
Now the tunnels that connect it are actually the proteins here.

101
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:22,480
So as we produce protein in the body, what we're actually doing, or produce protein in

102
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,960
a particular organism, what we're actually doing is sort of providing the track to allow

103
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,800
us to go from one metabolite to another.

104
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,000
And in metabolic engineering, it's like a build out.

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,400
So we have an organism that already has sort of like a subway station like layout.

106
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,360
And we're finding the closest station where we have to build out to a particular molecule.

107
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,360
And then we find the proteins that will allow us to sort of build out there.

108
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:52,360
So the idea is that you've got proteins or what allow you to create these metabolites

109
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,840
that create some chemical reaction within the body that's desired.

110
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,840
And you're trying to engineer the protein so that you can goose the creation of these

111
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
metabolites.

112
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,840
Is that the idea?

113
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,840
Yeah, in a sense.

114
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,920
So a lot of times we don't necessarily even create the protein.

115
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,720
So what we might do when we're building a particular strain, a J. Bay, we build different

116
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,320
strains of microorganisms by, and we add to their metabolism.

117
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,160
We might look across all domains of life.

118
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:27,240
So we might borrow from mint, breweries, yeast, evergreen trees.

119
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,040
And inside of all these organisms are tons of different proteins.

120
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,800
And each protein, you can think of it just like a little nano machine.

121
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,760
I mean, that's what they are.

122
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,040
That basically is a factory for turning one chemical into another.

123
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:44,440
And so we'll scour these things across life and essentially borrow the important machines

124
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,120
that each one has painstakingly developed over the many years of its evolution and put

125
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,800
them into our organism of interest so that they can actually make that thing.

126
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,360
Is that that aspect of a protein, kind of this micro machine idea?

127
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,960
Is that fundamental to what a protein is or kind of a side product of the way they

128
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,000
exist or how they're used in the body?

129
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,160
Oh, that's absolutely fundamental.

130
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,520
So every enzyme does this.

131
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,840
And in fact, there's a great deal of really cool YouTube videos out there that show sort

132
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,680
of how much like machines they actually are.

133
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,880
I think that oftentimes people kind of think of them very abstractly, but they're doing

134
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,640
physical things.

135
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,320
So for example, there are proteins that literally walk along these structures inside of your

136
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,920
cells called actin fibers.

137
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,280
They're essentially the skeleton.

138
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,280
But it's like a highway.

139
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,520
So you've got these little proteins and they've got these two little molecular legs and

140
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,640
they're literally walking along at Dragon Cargo.

141
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,440
I mean, inside the human body, it's just, it's molecular clockwork.

142
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:43,960
It's incredibly complex.

143
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,960
Wow.

144
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
Wow.

145
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,960
Yeah.

146
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:50,120
So maybe talk through a specific example.

147
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,960
You're working on specific metabolic pathways in your research.

148
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Is that right?

149
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,560
Yeah, absolutely.

150
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:04,680
One of the ones that, while we deal with two in the paper, in a recent paper, republished,

151
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:12,240
and one of them is producing a molecule called Lymanine, which is a candidate fuel molecule.

152
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,200
Lymanine is a major component of citrus fruit oils and is actually used as a fragrance.

153
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,280
If you were to smell it, it has like a lemony scent.

154
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,640
But it also turns out it can be used as a fuel.

155
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,600
You can burn it and make your car go.

156
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,080
And in this case, yeah, so we, like I was saying before, we borrowed several different

157
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,080
proteins.

158
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:37,520
And I think actually the examples I gave you before were for this particular strain.

159
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,880
For mint and brewers, yeast and evergreen trees, they're about 10 proteins.

160
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,520
We had to add to this organism.

161
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,680
And the goal here is to basically take these organisms once you've genetically modified

162
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,680
them.

163
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,480
And you put them through a similar process that you brew beer with.

164
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,720
So essentially you put them in this broth, which contains the sugars they need to live.

165
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,360
And then you let them grow up.

166
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,640
And in the process of growing, they release their metabolite.

167
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,240
So your Lymanine, you make a lot of that.

168
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,520
If your strain is good, they make as much as possible.

169
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,440
And you'll actually be able to just skim that off the top or find a way of isolating

170
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,840
it pretty easily.

171
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
And then you're good.

172
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:22,520
So a lot of the problems that we deal with in metabolic engineering involve maximizing

173
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:26,880
the production of a particular biomolecule so that we can extract it and use it.

174
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,920
And so you mentioned a bunch of substances, mint and other things.

175
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:42,240
Are these needed to be put into, like, in proportion into this concoction, or are you,

176
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,280
is it, you know, you've got your trying, you know, just mint or just something else and

177
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,240
just something else and seeing which ones you can kind of get the most of this Lymanate

178
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,240
from?

179
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
Oh, so yeah.

180
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,280
So what we do is we actually never use those organisms.

181
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,400
We look in their genomes and we pull out parts of their genetic code.

182
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,200
And that part of the genetic code codes for the particular nano-machine of interest

183
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,640
inside of those organisms.

184
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,040
So then we take out, you know, we'll take a protein from men to protein from brewers

185
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,480
used to protein from evergreen trees.

186
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:19,280
And then we will put that in our organism of interest and put that DNA in there and it

187
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:23,520
will learn how to make though it then from that DNA, it's able to use that as a blueprint

188
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:28,360
to make the proteins that it needs to actually make Lymanate, which is our compound of interest.

189
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,520
But the challenging part is to make sure you get the proportions of all those proteins

190
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,520
correct.

191
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
Yeah.

192
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:39,360
And in this particular example, the organism of interest is absolutely.

193
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Yeah.

194
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,640
So in this study, we were using E. coli.

195
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:50,200
E. coli is just one of the standard model organisms in synthetic biology.

196
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,560
The reason we use it is because it has a lot of genetic tools and it's been studied.

197
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,680
So it's easy to use things like CRISPR-Cas9, based systems for integrating things and it's

198
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,280
easy to get DNA out into the organism and it's pretty easy to grow and it grows quickly.

199
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:14,800
So E. coli is this, you know, it's basically like a macro machine, if you will.

200
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,880
And your process is changing some of its micro machinery to let it do different things.

201
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,800
And you kind of inject these proteins or add these proteins to it to get it to be better

202
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,960
at producing a particular result for you.

203
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,960
Yeah, exactly.

204
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,400
So yeah, we're just adding things to it to help to change its metabolism so it can make

205
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,320
our target compound 100%.

206
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,320
Awesome.

207
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,800
And so how does machine learning and data science fit into all that?

208
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Oh, yeah.

209
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:51,560
This is, so there's a few challenges actually that people, so when we're trying to actually

210
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:56,640
put things into these organisms, we have to figure out sort of what proportions we ultimately

211
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:59,880
want the proteins to be at, right?

212
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,400
We want, and we also want to understand the dynamic behavior of these organisms.

213
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:11,120
So in order to do that traditionally, it was a very, very complicated process.

214
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,640
You need a domain expert and that domain expert has to write down very complicated differential

215
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:22,800
equations which describe the dynamic behavior of this system.

216
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,480
And so, you know, we actually went through the process and did that, but it turns out

217
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,200
that it's really hard to do this well enough because oftentimes the information you need

218
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,840
to build that model isn't present in the literature.

219
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,840
So you have to guess.

220
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,400
You have to make a lot of guessing and you create a very structured model.

221
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,800
But we saw an opportunity to, instead of just building these models by hand, find a way

222
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,440
to use machine learning so that we didn't have to make any assumptions about the structure

223
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,800
of the dynamics of these systems.

224
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:02,160
And okay, so maybe the best way to go here is sort of to a 30,000 foot view of what

225
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,920
we were trying to do in that paper, does that sound reasonable?

226
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:06,920
Sure.

227
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Okay, cool.

228
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,200
So, once we actually had, so in our case, we were trying to use time series data to actually

229
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,840
figure out what the dynamic behavior of these systems were.

230
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:23,760
And the problem, I think, can be phrased pretty simply, which is, let's say I give you,

231
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,560
so imagine a ball and a hill.

232
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,760
And the hill can have any kind of shape.

233
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:33,040
Maybe it's oblong, maybe it's bumpy, maybe it's tall or short.

234
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
You don't really know.

235
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:39,840
But I'm going to give you a set of trajectories for how the ball rolls down the hill, given

236
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,840
different starting points.

237
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:44,920
So I'm going to put the ball maybe at the top and maybe somewhere down the side of this

238
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,920
hill.

239
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,120
And then I'm going to give you just what it looks like for the ball to roll down the

240
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
hill.

241
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,600
And essentially what we were trying to do is, given all these time series data sets, can

242
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,280
you actually reconstruct the hill?

243
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,200
Can you tell me what the hill looks like?

244
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:07,440
And in that way, we can actually figure out how the entire system will behave regardless

245
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,040
of the setup of the proteins in the cell.

246
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,480
So we're actually able to determine production.

247
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,720
We're able to simulate all these cells without actually having a model a priori defined.

248
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:27,480
So this hill analogy, I think, will be familiar to many or most listeners from kind of conversations

249
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,360
around gradient descent and finding local optima on the hill.

250
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,520
It sounds like you're doing something a little different, which is trying to capture the

251
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
hill itself.

252
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
Exactly.

253
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
Yeah.

254
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,920
So we figure with time series data, what you have is this relationship for how something

255
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,840
moves.

256
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:52,600
And in our case, when you have the whole of metabolism, it's this very complicated dynamic

257
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,600
process.

258
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,240
And we want to understand.

259
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:59,920
And when I say dynamic process, all that I mean is that let's say we know something about

260
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:07,080
what chemicals are present at, what concentrations in the cell at this particular moment, then

261
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,320
I should be able to tell you, at the next moment, what those chemical compositions are

262
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,520
going to look like based on the state of the cell.

263
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,800
And so if we have time series, essentially, we have examples of all those transitions.

264
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,680
And we can back out, essentially, what should happen more generally if we have enough

265
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,560
of those transitions.

266
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,760
And the time series data that you have is what, in particular?

267
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Yeah.

268
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:41,120
So we had initially a really great data set, which I think by most, compared to most of

269
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,280
the guests here is probably very small.

270
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:51,640
But this data set contained a total of six different strains.

271
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,800
And each of those strains had a time series set of measurements for both proteins.

272
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,880
So those are the machines.

273
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,320
So we have protein concentrations.

274
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,200
And we have metabolite concentrations.

275
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:07,520
So these are all sort of the intermediate stations between where, you know, using going

276
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,040
back to the analogy for the subway station, there's sort of the intermediate chemical stations

277
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,120
between where I am in metabolism and where I want to go.

278
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,280
So I've got these two separate concentrations for a set of time points.

279
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,080
And what I'm trying to do is predict what happens to the metabolites at the very next time

280
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,320
point.

281
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,320
Okay.

282
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:35,640
And the, maybe going back to the analogy of the hill, the hill then represents, is it

283
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:42,880
your ability to predict forward at any point in time or is it, is it something else?

284
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,160
No, you're exactly right.

285
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,480
So if you know the hill, right, you can put the ball down anywhere and you can tell me

286
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,480
what happens next.

287
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,320
And the same way, if you know how a strain starts out its life, I can tell you how it's

288
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
going to evolve.

289
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,200
And ultimately, how much limony that will end up producing over time.

290
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,360
And we can also look to see if there's any problems.

291
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:07,560
As these metabolites change, they can signal toxicity issues or other problems that want

292
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:10,720
to address in the metabolic engineering process.

293
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,400
So it gives us a lot of information if we can sort of do these experiments in silico.

294
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:24,560
Maybe it's also worth making some points about how there are challenges in synthetic biology

295
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:30,640
with machine learning and sort of what are some unique things that we face.

296
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,920
Before we do that, maybe talk a little bit about the kind of the method, right?

297
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:43,320
So you've got this time series data that you captured you're trying to ultimately characterize

298
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:49,160
the complex behavior of the system with that time series data.

299
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,760
How did you get from the data to the characterization?

300
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,360
What was your overall process?

301
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
Yeah.

302
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,360
Okay.

303
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,200
So you have this data, like I said before.

304
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,120
And from these time series, essentially what we do is we smooth it out because we actually

305
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,840
have not that many time points.

306
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,680
And then we calculate the time derivatives for each of the metabolites on this path.

307
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:20,840
And so that gives us this relationship between the metabolites at a given time to the metabolites

308
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,440
at the next instant in time.

309
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:29,200
So in other words, how does the internal chemical state of the cell change at each unit in

310
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
that particular time series?

311
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:38,880
And once or these are, do you think of these metabolites, these are like partial derivatives

312
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,760
of this equation that you're ultimately trying to figure out?

313
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,800
Yeah, just time derivatives, yeah.

314
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,720
So we have time derivatives of these, we have time derivatives of these metabolic paths

315
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
through time.

316
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,560
And then each metabolite state derivative pair, including, and also their proteins are

317
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:04,440
included in the features for each of these at each time point represents one example that

318
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,560
will feed to our model.

319
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:12,000
And so essentially from the three or six time series, we're able to expand that out.

320
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,800
And since if we've sampled enough along that curve, then we can actually augment the

321
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:22,600
data set and produce on the order of say maybe a hundred examples for each one of those,

322
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,800
each one of those complete time series curves.

323
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,080
So it's still relatively small in terms of the total amount of data we have to work

324
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,080
with.

325
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
Okay.

326
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,120
So you've got your input features are basically these time series derivatives.

327
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:44,000
And then you're using these to predict the overall system characteristics.

328
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,360
What kind of models did you, are you applying to this?

329
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,360
Yeah, so because we have sort of limited data, we use more traditional machine learning

330
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,600
approaches.

331
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:02,520
And for us, that meant, you know, random forest, so ensemble tree-based approaches.

332
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:08,600
We actually used one of the freely available meta learners, this package called T-POT,

333
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:15,360
which allowed us to sort of search for the best models that would help us find the relationship

334
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,440
between the metabolism state and the metabolism derivative at each time point.

335
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,520
And yeah, so once we get, once we extract one of those models, then we use that to do

336
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,440
downstream processing.

337
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,400
The downstream processing in this case is what?

338
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
Okay.

339
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,320
So as soon as we have that relationship, the model itself, you can think of that as the

340
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,000
hill from before.

341
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,520
So we have, so that model tells us in the context of the hill, if we find a good model,

342
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,120
we feed it a bunch of time series and then we get a model.

343
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,440
That model represents our hill.

344
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,960
So at any time point, or at any point we put the ball down on, we will know exactly where

345
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,600
it moves at the next point.

346
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,800
And what we want to actually extract from these models are entirely new time series.

347
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:09,200
So what we do is we take that model and we integrate it over time and allow us to get

348
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,400
trajectories.

349
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,280
So we can put the ball down at the top of the hill and then essentially use a numerical

350
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,960
integration technique to let us understand the trajectory of that ball as it rolls down

351
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,200
the hill.

352
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,680
And how does that ultimately tie in to allowing you to kind of manufacture these compounds

353
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,600
more efficiently?

354
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,600
Yeah.

355
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,120
So once we have a model that tells us how the organism state evolves over time, then

356
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:41,600
what this does is addresses one of the key challenges that we have in synthetic biology,

357
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,240
which is every time you want to make any data, the reason why our data sets are so small

358
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,760
is that we can actually make lots of features, so that's not too bad.

359
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:57,060
Every time we build a particular strain that makes a particular molecule, it can take

360
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:02,840
maybe two, three, six months to get that strain to work, depending on what we're trying

361
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,840
to do.

362
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,680
And once we have that strain working, we can actually extract many, many features from

363
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,680
it.

364
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:13,560
But using this model, what we're actually able to do is take relatively few strains, which

365
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,960
again are very time-consuming and difficult to make, often very expensive as well.

366
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:23,320
And then use that to build an in silico model, where we can then do a bunch of experiments

367
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,480
where we vary a lot of parameters to try to find the best strain to make next.

368
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:32,120
And so oftentimes what we're doing is just trying to minimize the amount of things we

369
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,480
actually have to build because it is so expensive.

370
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:42,520
When you're trying to vary the proportions of these strains and kind of come up with a

371
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:50,560
next set of things to test, have you applied a machine learning to that particular part

372
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,440
of the problem, or is that more traditional simulation and things like that?

373
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,400
Well, traditionally, actually, this is something that we're working on now.

374
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:04,720
We have a paper in preparation to kind of handle this issue, absolutely.

375
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:12,120
So oftentimes what's traditionally done is that biologists who make the strains themselves

376
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,920
will basically, they'll make their strains and they'll test them out, and then they'll

377
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,840
use intuition or knowledge from the literature to make those decisions.

378
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,160
But once you have a lot of variables, you have a lot of, let's say, a lot of proteins

379
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,800
that you need to change at once, their intuition often breaks down.

380
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:32,960
And so absolutely, we're applying various kinds of methods to making predictions on how

381
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,520
to change the strain next.

382
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:41,160
And that's sort of an extension to this method that we describe in the paper.

383
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:47,920
If we use a Bayesian optimization-like approaches to handle that, along with some Monte Carlo

384
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,320
sampling type approaches.

385
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:55,720
So yeah, that work is forthcoming, and hopefully soon we'll be out in the world, so.

386
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Cool.

387
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,640
How does the Monte Carlo sampling apply here?

388
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,120
Oh, I'm not sure I can give this stuff away just yet, but I'd be happy with it.

389
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
It's pre-pub.

390
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
Yeah, it's pre-pub.

391
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
Got it.

392
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,640
So yeah, I'd love to share, I really would, but as soon as it's out, I'll definitely share

393
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,640
with everybody.

394
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,520
Sure enough, fair enough.

395
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,720
You know, this conversation is interesting.

396
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:27,520
It reminds me of an interview that I did recently that hasn't been posted yet with our researcher

397
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:38,480
named Nathan Kuts out of the University of Washington, who is trying to also apply control

398
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:48,400
systems theory and time series data in his case to the problem of tuning lasers and also

399
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:55,920
building models that describe neurological pathways and simple organisms.

400
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,400
And the thing that he did that is kind of potentially interesting to you, like he's

401
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,160
also trying to find the shape of the hill, right?

402
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:11,800
Like in your case, you know, these things are traditionally models with explicit equations

403
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:19,200
and differentiated and all that kind of stuff, and so he created this model that is the

404
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,240
model is a linear combination of all different kinds of features that you might expect to

405
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,080
be in one of the physics equations.

406
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:36,240
You know, so exponentials and squares and qubits and all these, all these like higher order

407
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:43,120
types of factors and then use some relatively simple, you know, linear regression types

408
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:53,240
of techniques to fit a model to the time series data and ultimately use that to determine

409
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:58,200
like the empirical equations that govern these relationships for the problems that he's

410
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:05,400
trying to solve, which sounds kind of interesting, you know, I said that mostly to kind of

411
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:12,800
challenge myself to explain what he described to me, but also because it sounds like an

412
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:17,200
interesting kind of parallel approach to solving this ultimate problem that you're trying

413
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,200
to solve.

414
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:23,320
Yeah, I mean, I think it's one of these things where you take down deep enough in enough

415
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,160
fields and there's fundamentally shared challenges.

416
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,120
And I think definitely one of the big ones right now, one of the things I see cropping

417
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,840
up in different fields is this issue of how do you understand dynamic behavior just from

418
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,840
data and anybody who's doing that in a different context is certainly really interesting to

419
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,840
me.

420
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,520
You've got this, these systems, like can you talk at all about what the impact of this

421
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,760
work has been or what kind of results you've seen or like, how is this fundamentally

422
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,360
changed this work for you?

423
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:02,240
Yeah, so we're moving forward now from the paper and we're trying to basically go from

424
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,720
the smaller data sets that have been collected and motivate bigger data collections so that

425
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,680
we can see what happens once we actually get into the realm where we can start using

426
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,840
more sophisticated models.

427
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,040
And so I mean, so far it's relatively new so there's, we've gotten a lot of interest

428
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,160
from other researchers and trying to use this for other applications.

429
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,840
People have been interested in the microbiome, that's one of the big things that people

430
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,400
are interested in right now, figuring out how this interplay between all these different

431
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,120
microbes actually plays out because right now there's a real challenge with predactivity

432
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
in that arena.

433
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:48,680
So I think the impact going forward is likely to be providing predactivity where before

434
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,440
a lack of experimental knowledge or a lack of scientific knowledge would have limited

435
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,400
us for making good models.

436
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,880
And ultimately, I want to live in a world where more data in some sense equals greater

437
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,720
predactivity and more knowledge.

438
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,920
But right now, those things aren't actually all that coupled.

439
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:11,920
Are you personally involved in some of these applications to adjacent areas or is this

440
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:17,840
just things that you're seeing in the community kind of grow out of some of your work?

441
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,640
Those things will just be starting for us.

442
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,720
So we're definitely reaching out and looking for collaborations.

443
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,240
That's definitely a big thing that, you know, is, is for us.

444
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,920
And yeah, I mean, definitely, we're, and you know, there's, there's other things

445
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:40,320
ongoing recently we've, we've acquired a new robot here at, at a J Bay in order to actually

446
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,600
start producing the kind of data we really want in order to rigorously evaluate this

447
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,960
for bigger data sets and see if we can really learn substantial things that will let us

448
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,480
solve the major challenges of metabolic engineering and do this effectively, effectively

449
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,360
increase the titers without so much failure in our guessing, yeah.

450
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:06,240
But one of the questions that I did have was you mentioned that the kind of cycle time

451
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,640
of setting up an experiment or, or creating one of these organisms is, you know, on the

452
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,960
order of months to the, to six months to kind of get it right.

453
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,840
What all happens in that two to six months?

454
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,840
Oh, yeah.

455
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,680
So this is, this is the, the messy and interesting world of the lab.

456
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:29,160
So, you know, if, if we, we start out with essentially an idea, which is, all right, here's

457
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,520
the pro, we're trying to make substance acts.

458
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,320
Let's go back to, you know, Lymanine say, maybe even we could, we could do a different,

459
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,320
let's say, Pynine.

460
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:41,880
Pynine can, is, is a substance you can find in, in pine nuts and it also, you can use it

461
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,800
as a jet fuel, it turns out.

462
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:48,240
And so, you know, the reaches, researchers, researchers say they want to create, create

463
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,880
Pynine using one of their strains.

464
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,640
And so first they go into the literature and they look for all the, the proteins they're

465
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,200
going to need to put into the organism.

466
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,280
And so first you need to get those synthesized.

467
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:03,280
You have to go send those off to a company who makes that DNA.

468
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,040
They go ahead and they, they make all that DNA, they send it to us.

469
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,640
And then, then the next step is the researchers have to test out each one of those proteins

470
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,000
to make sure they work because we're taking it from some other organism and putting it into

471
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
a new context.

472
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,120
It's like, if you went to some, you know, semiconductor factory and you used a machine that was

473
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,240
kind of similar to what you needed and say like a textile factory, you have to bring

474
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,840
it back and make sure it's still working in that context.

475
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,240
And so they go through the process of validating all these different enzymes, making sure they

476
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,400
work.

477
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,440
And then you have to put them all together into a single piece of DNA and put them in.

478
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,160
And depending on the organism, this can be a time-consuming process.

479
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,920
So first you have to put it all together and that can take, you know, a few days to

480
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,160
a week to do that.

481
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,680
If it works, if it doesn't, you have to go through a set of troubleshooting steps.

482
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:55,080
And then, you know, let's say you actually get it all assembled and you put it in, you

483
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,480
know, maybe it does certain parts of it don't express well enough.

484
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,440
Maybe, you know, there's a lot of issues that can go wrong.

485
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,200
So that can take a period of time as well.

486
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,240
And then once you get past that point of putting it all in, you have a strain and then you

487
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,240
can test that strain.

488
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,440
So all of these things, you know, there's like for almost all those steps, there's like,

489
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,120
you know, weeks to months, depending on how much difficulty you encounter.

490
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,960
And then you put it all together and you hope it does what you want it to do.

491
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,960
So.

492
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:28,680
And I've got to imagine that in the kind of scenarios you're describing, the data that

493
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:38,000
you're collecting can be fairly noisy, fairly messy, which I think would compound or be

494
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,760
compounded by the fact that you're not collecting a ton of it.

495
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,360
Are there things that you've had to do in your pipelines or modeling processes that you've

496
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,080
had to do specifically because of those issues?

497
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,080
Yeah.

498
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,760
We're definitely very aware of it.

499
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,360
There's a limited amount we can actually do about it right now.

500
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,800
I mean, really it's going towards future challenges.

501
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:05,760
Usually all these experiments, kind of the field standard, which, you know, may have to

502
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,040
change is you do everything in triplicate.

503
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,080
So if you do an experiment, you do three copies of the same experiment.

504
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,040
And then you can use that triplicate data to sort of narrow down where you expect it

505
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
actually to show up.

506
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:23,480
And so you can get, you know, tighter bounds on the error for each one of your measurements.

507
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:29,040
But oftentimes even after you do that, even after you take into account, you know, all of

508
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,960
the variation, you still can have really substantial variation in your data.

509
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,680
And part of that is just because it's a messy process, you know, you have human beings doing

510
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,480
the sampling and human beings have to be, you know, their lives are taken into account.

511
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,960
So for example, the data set we're working with was collected by two postdocs.

512
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,440
Over 72 hours.

513
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:53,400
They literally were sitting beside the fermenter and every two to four hours.

514
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,640
They had to go collect their samples, prep them and deal with them.

515
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:00,400
And so like, you know, they took turns like sleeping so that they could do this.

516
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,280
And that's part of the reason why we don't have a lot of data sets like that.

517
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,840
Not to mention, you know, it's lack of sleep and then maybe you miss it by 20 minutes

518
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,840
on the measurement.

519
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,240
You know, if you've got a time, a variation in your time measurement by plus or minus

520
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,120
20 minutes, you know, that, that of course can introduce error.

521
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,840
And there's just little things like that.

522
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,560
So, you know, one of the things we're hoping is that as we move towards more robotic solutions,

523
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,440
we can sort of key in on all the components of the error and tighten it up much more.

524
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,800
And there's definitely, you know, there's definitely industrial players in the field who

525
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,520
are, who are doing this kind of thing as well.

526
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
Awesome.

527
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,520
Any advice or pointers for folks that are interested in this area and want to learn

528
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,320
more about what's happening in it?

529
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
Oh, yeah.

530
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,880
So pretty much now it's become very accessible.

531
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,120
If you're interested in biotechnology, there are a lot, at least in San Francisco, there

532
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,880
are a lot of sort of places where you can learn this, these sort of biohacker spaces.

533
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,040
So if you're interested, it's out there.

534
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:03,160
You can go and visit one of these things, look up your local biohacker space and you can

535
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:06,160
go out and figure out, you know, what's going on.

536
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,760
You can, you can do CRISPR, you know, it's, it's at the end of the day, it's very much

537
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,000
like cooking.

538
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,200
And if you know how to follow a recipe, you can learn how to do synthetic biology.

539
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:23,440
So then, I had no idea that CRISPR was that accessible, like what is, what's an example

540
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,760
of something that someone could do, you know, with CRISPR, just accessing a machine at

541
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,840
one of these biohacker spaces?

542
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
Yeah.

543
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:36,520
So CRISPR, you know, just like all the things we were talking about today, it's a protein.

544
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,120
And so it's defined by a piece of genetic code.

545
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:44,600
And so all you need to do is make these genetic constructs and you can use it.

546
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,440
In our case, you know, typically in biohacker spaces, you're not going to be dealing with

547
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,120
human cells.

548
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,960
That's a little bit more challenging.

549
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,440
There's issues with biosafety and things like that and getting approval.

550
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,520
So that'll be a little harder.

551
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,520
But if you want to work with plants or you want to work with, you want to work with microorganisms,

552
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,480
that's totally doable.

553
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:11,040
And so really at the end of the day, all you have is essentially a construct, just a piece

554
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,840
of DNA that you put into your cells and it will express CRISPR, which is, you know, these

555
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,760
genetic scissors that will allow you to essentially make cuts in the genome where you want that

556
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,960
are targeted by these guides.

557
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,440
And yeah, it's actually very accessible, you know, it's really at the end of the day,

558
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,440
you're transferring liquids from one thing to another and then if you do this in the right

559
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,320
order and you design your experiment right, you get, you know, the genetic modifications

560
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,200
you want and you can verify them in the lab pretty easily.

561
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:43,600
What would be in the book of 10 weekend projects to do at a biohacker space?

562
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:48,480
Oh, so this is actually, when I was first getting into it, I had very little syn bio experience.

563
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,400
So I visited some of these.

564
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,360
I think I guess shout out to bio curious, which is one of the ones in the day that was very

565
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,200
accessible, very friendly people.

566
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:06,600
At first, like the first thing you do in biology typically is you make things glow.

567
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,400
It turns out.

568
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,960
And you probably don't need CRISPR for this, but this might be one of the first things

569
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:20,000
you do is you sort of put these, you put in a piece of DNA that expresses a glowing protein

570
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,640
on this thing called GFP that comes from jellyfish and then you put these things under a light

571
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,840
and you can see them glow.

572
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,240
And so that, that way you can see the work you want done.

573
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,880
But in terms of like the cool projects they were doing, I'm not really up to date on what

574
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:40,520
everybody's doing now, but at the time they were working on making animal-free milk products

575
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:45,360
and things like that or animal-free cheese, I think, vegan cheese and by expressing a protein

576
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,840
called casin.

577
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,040
And I'm not sure which genetic tools they were using, but almost certainly you can find

578
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,960
a way to use, like if you want to get some experience with CRISPR, you can do it at one

579
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,960
of those places.

580
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,960
Wow.

581
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,960
Yeah.

582
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
It's really accessible.

583
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,960
High school kids are doing it these days.

584
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
Yeah.

585
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,160
Well, Zach, thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me.
