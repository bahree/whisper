00:00.000 --> 00:15.920
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

00:15.920 --> 00:20.880
people doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.480
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:23.480 --> 00:27.640
This week on the podcast we're running a series of shows consisting of conversations

00:27.640 --> 00:33.400
with some of the impressive speakers from an event called the AI Summit in New York City.

00:33.400 --> 00:38.840
The theme of that event and of this series is AI in the Enterprise and I think you'll

00:38.840 --> 00:43.800
find this series really interesting in that it includes a mix of both technical and case

00:43.800 --> 00:46.880
study oriented discussions.

00:46.880 --> 00:51.840
Now I won't actually be attending the AI Summit this week because I'm in Long Beach

00:51.840 --> 00:54.840
California attending the Nips Conference.

00:54.840 --> 01:00.000
There are a bunch of Twimble listeners here and I'm hoping to meet as many of you as possible.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.300
And yes, I have stickers.

01:02.300 --> 01:06.600
If you're here at Nips and you're actually listening to podcasts this week, please

01:06.600 --> 01:11.600
reach out to me either via the event app, the Nips event app where there's a Twimble

01:11.600 --> 01:17.240
listeners thread or via Twitter where my handle is at Sam Charrington.

01:17.240 --> 01:21.400
Before we proceed, let's quickly talk about the podcast schedule through the end of the

01:21.400 --> 01:22.400
year.

01:22.400 --> 01:26.360
Prior to my newsletter, you know that I've been on the road for a couple of weeks now.

01:26.360 --> 01:31.080
After this week's series, we've got two more series coming before we break for the year

01:31.080 --> 01:34.560
with our last show running on December 22nd.

01:34.560 --> 01:39.960
Now, if you're lamenting two weeks without your favorite machine learning and AI podcast,

01:39.960 --> 01:42.960
trust me with these two series.

01:42.960 --> 01:48.600
The first from the Amazon Web Services Reinvent Conference and the next one from Nips.

01:48.600 --> 01:53.640
You will have plenty of great content to tide you over until we get started again on January

01:53.640 --> 01:54.960
8th.

01:54.960 --> 02:01.280
Thanks to you, 2017 was a great year for the podcast and we plan to close it out strong.

02:01.280 --> 02:05.840
So keep your ears open the next few weeks and we hope to hear from you.

02:05.840 --> 02:11.720
Please note that on Wednesday, December 13th, we'll be holding our last Twimble Online

02:11.720 --> 02:14.080
Meetup of the Year.

02:14.080 --> 02:19.560
Bring your thoughts on the top machine learning and AI stories of 2017 for our discussion

02:19.560 --> 02:20.840
segment.

02:20.840 --> 02:25.960
And for our main presentation, Bruno Gensalvez, we'll be presenting the paper Understanding

02:25.960 --> 02:32.960
Deep Learning requires rethinking generalization by Shi Yuanjiang from MIT and Google Brain and

02:32.960 --> 02:34.280
others.

02:34.280 --> 02:40.440
You can find more details and register for the meetup at twimlai.com slash meetup.

02:40.440 --> 02:45.680
This AI Summit series is brought to you by our friends at IBM Power Systems.

02:45.680 --> 02:50.280
IBM Power Systems offers servers designed for mission critical applications and emerging

02:50.280 --> 02:55.360
workloads, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, advanced

02:55.360 --> 02:58.600
analytics, and high performance computing.

02:58.600 --> 03:04.000
IBM Power Systems benefit from a wide range of open technologies, many stemming from

03:04.000 --> 03:09.080
collaboration with fellow Open Power Foundation members, and they're designed to deliver

03:09.080 --> 03:15.800
performance efficiently, whether deployed in private, public, or hybrid clouds.

03:15.800 --> 03:23.400

slash IBM Power.

03:26.280 --> 03:31.360
Continuing with last show's theme of platforms for Enterprise AI, my guess this time around

03:31.360 --> 03:37.360
is Mazen Gilbert, Vice President of Advanced Technology and Architecture with AT&T.

03:37.360 --> 03:43.960
Mazen and I have a really interesting discussion on what's required to scale AI in the Enterprise,

03:43.960 --> 03:48.360
and you'll learn about a new open source project that AT&T is working on to allow any

03:48.360 --> 03:50.840
Enterprise to be able to do this.

03:50.840 --> 03:54.440
You already know by now that I geek out when it comes to talking about the intersection

03:54.440 --> 03:59.400
of machine learning and cloud computing, and this conversation is no exception.

03:59.400 --> 04:03.160
Be sure to let us know what you think by posting your comments or questions to the show

04:03.160 --> 04:08.400
notes page at twimlai.com slash talk slash 78.

04:08.400 --> 04:12.160
And now on to the show.

04:12.160 --> 04:20.880
All right, everyone, I am on the line with Mazen Gilbert.

04:20.880 --> 04:26.920
Mazen is Vice President of Advanced Technology and Architecture with AT&T.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.960
Mazen, welcome to this weekend machine learning and AI.

04:29.960 --> 04:33.320
Well, thank you very much for having me today.

04:33.320 --> 04:36.120
Yeah, I'm excited to jump into this conversation.

04:36.120 --> 04:39.560
You know, as is the tradition here, I like to get started by having you tell us a little

04:39.560 --> 04:45.000
bit about your background and how you came to get involved in AI projects.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.000
Well, thanks.

04:46.000 --> 04:53.320
So I started looking at AI and when I was just doing my graduate degree in the University

04:53.320 --> 05:02.240
of Liverpool, I got fascinated in the mid 80s about how you could use these AI technologies

05:02.240 --> 05:07.040
to really teach machines and computers and at the time, computers and machines were

05:07.040 --> 05:13.520
very primitive, how you can get these machines and computers to do sort of what humans can

05:13.520 --> 05:14.520
do.

05:14.520 --> 05:20.760
They can think and say and listen the way humans are, either that was extremely fascinating.

05:20.760 --> 05:27.760
It was an area that caught my passion and that started my graduate degree and I've been

05:27.760 --> 05:30.280
involved in AI machine learning ever since.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.280
Oh, wow.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.680
What did you do your graduate degree in?

05:33.680 --> 05:41.960
So my graduate degree, my PhD was on artificial neural networks for computer speech.

05:41.960 --> 05:47.040
So basically at the time, the problem I was trying to solve is how do you get computers

05:47.040 --> 05:50.320
to speak like humans using artificial neural networks?

05:50.320 --> 05:51.320
Okay.

05:51.320 --> 05:55.480
And what did speak like humans mean for you in that context?

05:55.480 --> 06:00.800
It was really, speak like a humans as the way that you and I are speaking today.

06:00.800 --> 06:07.200
The goal was to pass the touring test is that how can you get a machine to speak to you

06:07.200 --> 06:12.800
for so many seconds or half a minute without you knowing that was really a machine?

06:12.800 --> 06:18.760
Clearly in the past 30 years of a lot have changed but that was at the time, computer

06:18.760 --> 06:22.640
speech was extremely, very machine like.

06:22.640 --> 06:29.440
There was a lot of promise at the time of artificial neural networks could be sort of the new

06:29.440 --> 06:34.560
technology that can completely change that because of the association of artificial neural

06:34.560 --> 06:38.600
network with the real neural networks in the brain.

06:38.600 --> 06:43.720
And that's turned out to be, turned out to be true in terms of all of the advances that

06:43.720 --> 06:46.040
are happening now with deep learning.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.040
Yeah.

06:47.040 --> 06:53.440
Absolutely. I mean, it's quite astronomical to see how much deep learning, which is really

06:53.440 --> 06:56.320
based on artificial neural network.

06:56.320 --> 07:01.840
How we've managed in the past 30 years to use those in a lot of different areas beyond

07:01.840 --> 07:06.520
just computer speech, they're very powerful tools.

07:06.520 --> 07:12.680
And I think what they've a lot of had changed in the past 30 years, but the basic algorithm,

07:12.680 --> 07:18.920
the basic technologies from the 70s and 80s are still in use today.

07:18.920 --> 07:22.400
And so did you go directly from grad school to AT&T?

07:22.400 --> 07:23.400
I did.

07:23.400 --> 07:30.760
So I actually came to visit AT&T Bell Labs in the late 80s while I was doing this work.

07:30.760 --> 07:33.080
I was really fascinated by the place.

07:33.080 --> 07:39.480
It was like a kid in a candy store, you know, it's like you get to do your passion and

07:39.480 --> 07:43.080
your hobby and get paid for it, too.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.800
So it was, it was really an amazing experience.

07:45.800 --> 07:51.280
I knew at the time when I met a bunch of the folks that I used to sort of know them, when

07:51.280 --> 07:55.200
I used to write these papers, they used to be like a reference in my book, a reference

07:55.200 --> 07:56.600
in my papers.

07:56.600 --> 08:01.920
And now I get to see them face to face and some of the pioneers that invented, you know,

08:01.920 --> 08:07.640
a lot of amazing technology and digital transformation and transistors and others.

08:07.640 --> 08:14.920
It was an amazing experience and it was very clear that was the place for me and honestly

08:14.920 --> 08:18.880
as soon as I couldn't even wait to finish my graduate degree.

08:18.880 --> 08:24.680
In fact, I ended up doing, I finished my graduate degree at AT&T Bell Labs because it was

08:24.680 --> 08:28.440
an area they were very interested in and neural networks.

08:28.440 --> 08:29.840
So that's how it started.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.680
Oh, wow, wow.

08:31.680 --> 08:37.880
Can you give me a, you know, certainly AT&T and the labs are, you know, doing a ton of

08:37.880 --> 08:43.920
things with regards to AI, you know, how can you give us a kind of a landscape of the

08:43.920 --> 08:46.080
different areas that you're working in?

08:46.080 --> 08:53.480
Yeah, it's AI is a very critical area for us and has been ready for decades.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.480
It is, it's really the way we think of AI.

08:56.480 --> 09:02.600
It's a, it's a way of doing data powered smart automation and when you think about it as

09:02.600 --> 09:09.000
it's just data powered smart automation, it really touches every part of our business.

09:09.000 --> 09:14.000
The machine learning side is what makes it data powered and the AI is what provides this

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
smart automation.

09:15.000 --> 09:19.280
That's sort of how we think of the two and the relationship with each other.

09:19.280 --> 09:25.000
The way we look at this is that where are we spending a lot of our dollars today and

09:25.000 --> 09:30.480
that we need something new capabilities that are disruptive in the market, disruptive for

09:30.480 --> 09:35.960
AT&T really to try to break down our cost structure and provide better experience to our

09:35.960 --> 09:39.640
customers and better products to our customers.

09:39.640 --> 09:44.320
So we've identified a number of what we call them, major pillars, several years back

09:44.320 --> 09:49.920
and a lot of our activities are really focused on those pillars.

09:49.920 --> 09:50.920
And what are they?

09:50.920 --> 09:56.000
So the pillars are number one is infrastructure and engineering.

09:56.000 --> 10:03.080
So think of that as a company like AT&T that invests significantly in capital and infrastructure

10:03.080 --> 10:10.080
in building 4G and 5G and we're in the homes and we're in your devices and everything.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.200
There's a huge infrastructure that we put in place.

10:12.200 --> 10:17.440
So we spend a lot of time and capabilities in applying machine learning and AI to really

10:17.440 --> 10:24.800
do smarter investment and spending of building out our infrastructure.

10:24.800 --> 10:29.400
Where do we put the small sales, where do we put the macro sales, where do we invest

10:29.400 --> 10:34.080
more in what part of the US, where there is most traffic or we think there will be traffic

10:34.080 --> 10:36.160
over the next year to three years.

10:36.160 --> 10:38.520
So that's infrastructure and engineering.

10:38.520 --> 10:43.400
Number two is in the area of customer experience and I think customer care and customer experience

10:43.400 --> 10:49.440
is the traditional approach as you know, the whole industry went into that with AI when

10:49.440 --> 10:56.600
they started using speech recognition and speech synthesis and some natural language processing

10:56.600 --> 11:01.880
to start doing part of what humans would do today, at least some of the basic things

11:01.880 --> 11:06.400
of let's say understanding the intent of the customer and routing the customer.

11:06.400 --> 11:13.000
So we're doing a lot of that and have been doing that for chat, for voice, for internet,

11:13.000 --> 11:18.000
for email, basically the customer experience side of the game.

11:18.000 --> 11:23.400
The third pillar that we also invest a lot of time is obviously security and when you

11:23.400 --> 11:32.400
look at the size of AT&T and we provide our customers with a secure network, both consumer

11:32.400 --> 11:39.120
and enterprise and those hackers are becoming smarter and smarter and so that we have to

11:39.120 --> 11:46.960
apply the best and the latest technologies to identify even trends or patterns of an

11:46.960 --> 11:53.240
initial attack to any of our customers or to our network so we can address that quickly

11:53.240 --> 11:59.520
before it becomes a big issue and there are millions of those that are attempted every

11:59.520 --> 12:00.520
hour of the day.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.560
So that's a third area.

12:02.560 --> 12:05.920
The fourth area is our network and operation.

12:05.920 --> 12:11.920
As you know, we run one of the most complex networks in the world and that network has

12:11.920 --> 12:17.920
evolved over the past century since the invention of the telephone.

12:17.920 --> 12:21.960
You can imagine that there is a lot of push to try to make it zero touch, to make it

12:21.960 --> 12:25.960
completely automated, to make it completely software defined.

12:25.960 --> 12:30.760
So there's a lot of work we do in that area and the last one I will mention is sort of

12:30.760 --> 12:35.160
the area where we look for a new revenue opportunity.

12:35.160 --> 12:42.520
So we apply AI machine learning for advertising, media analytics and for a lot of our, in

12:42.520 --> 12:48.000
the future, a lot of our enterprise businesses that they sell to customers, what that is

12:48.000 --> 12:53.840
to do with the internet of things, what that is to do with smart cities, healthcare,

12:53.840 --> 12:58.000
the opportunity space is big, AT&T is a very diverse company.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.280
And as you can imagine, there are a lot of opportunities there.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.560
That is a ton of stuff.

13:04.560 --> 13:14.800
So in your role, what's your specific organization's responsibility with regard to these five

13:14.800 --> 13:20.200
pillars is it staying ahead of kind of where this technology is going and then feeding

13:20.200 --> 13:24.520
it back to businesses or are you building out projects and products that these businesses

13:24.520 --> 13:26.320
can take advantage of?

13:26.320 --> 13:29.880
How do you think of the role of your business?

13:29.880 --> 13:36.280
So it's along the line what you said, I lead an organization, the advanced technology

13:36.280 --> 13:37.880
and architecture.

13:37.880 --> 13:41.160
This is the research arm also for AT&T.

13:41.160 --> 13:47.760
And part of my responsibility is to ensure AT&T is always one step ahead and two steps

13:47.760 --> 13:48.760
ahead.

13:48.760 --> 13:54.680
So it's not just understanding the technology, but also understanding where are the opportunities

13:54.680 --> 14:00.920
and the applications where we could provide value add to our customers and better products

14:00.920 --> 14:03.320
and services to our customers.

14:03.320 --> 14:07.520
That is part of my organization, part of the job that we do.

14:07.520 --> 14:12.440
But beyond that, it's also about one thing I think you're just striking about all the

14:12.440 --> 14:18.360
pillars I mentioned, we're not a company trying to build an application for AI.

14:18.360 --> 14:23.800
We're not trying to build a voice personal assistant and make it a variable to our customers.

14:23.800 --> 14:24.800
We're not.

14:24.800 --> 14:25.800
Right.

14:25.800 --> 14:26.800
Right.

14:26.800 --> 14:31.120
The use of AI machine learning for us is across many different services, many different

14:31.120 --> 14:36.360
opportunities where we spend billions of dollars today in each of these pillars.

14:36.360 --> 14:43.080
So there are not just 10 or 20, but they're literally in the thousands of applications

14:43.080 --> 14:45.640
where AI machine learning is required.

14:45.640 --> 14:51.160
So part of my responsibility is to make sure that we can scale and that each of these

14:51.160 --> 14:58.520
application is not yet another service, new technology, new operation of its own, we

14:58.520 --> 15:04.720
have to provide some harmonization to make sure that all of these thousands of applications,

15:04.720 --> 15:10.880
when we get there, they all are built on a common platform, common technology, common

15:10.880 --> 15:16.640
capability, so as technology evolve, you are benefiting everybody.

15:16.640 --> 15:21.800
You're not building just a silo application for one set of users.

15:21.800 --> 15:28.480
One of the challenges in building platforms when we're so early in the technology cycle

15:28.480 --> 15:32.600
is that it's not clear what the pieces of that platform need to be.

15:32.600 --> 15:40.560
How are you addressing that and other challenges that you run into given, you know, the scale

15:40.560 --> 15:46.720
that you described and the fact that you're trying to apply AI very broadly across these

15:46.720 --> 15:48.800
thousands of opportunities?

15:48.800 --> 15:50.280
That's really a great question.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.880
It's you're absolutely right.

15:51.880 --> 15:59.320
I think that, you know, although the technology behind machine learning and AI have been

15:59.320 --> 16:06.800
brewing for decades, but we are just at the tip of the mountain, touching that sort of

16:06.800 --> 16:11.520
our initial, we're getting just a flavor of, well, where are all the opportunities, until

16:11.520 --> 16:16.400
you understand all the opportunities, it's hard to say, well, here is the platform that's

16:16.400 --> 16:18.160
going to support all these opportunities.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.200
So you absolutely, absolutely right.

16:20.200 --> 16:23.720
So the way we're looking at this is sort of a little different.

16:23.720 --> 16:28.920
We're looking at this coming in saying, well, you are absolutely right.

16:28.920 --> 16:32.400
And we have to enable the technology is going to continue to change.

16:32.400 --> 16:34.280
There's going to be new applications.

16:34.280 --> 16:35.720
There's going to be new tools.

16:35.720 --> 16:37.680
There's going to be new capabilities.

16:37.680 --> 16:42.960
The way we need to think about the platform, we have to build an open platform.

16:42.960 --> 16:50.400
It's got to be an open platform that enable rapid innovation, not just within AT&T, but

16:50.400 --> 16:53.640
within the global ecosystem.

16:53.640 --> 17:00.200
And it's a platform in which that our vendors and our suppliers and our partners are part

17:00.200 --> 17:04.640
of the development of this platform, part of the ecosystem.

17:04.640 --> 17:11.680
Because we are all sort of joining hands together to building sort of harmonizing the core

17:11.680 --> 17:15.400
foundation behind AI across the world.

17:15.400 --> 17:20.360
It's because every company out there have the same challenge, the same issue.

17:20.360 --> 17:22.960
And every company is going to end up doing their own thing.

17:22.960 --> 17:28.960
Unless we really build the foundation platform to be open and transparent.

17:28.960 --> 17:36.800
You know, I came across a reference on your website to Acumos, is that, you know, a platform

17:36.800 --> 17:40.120
or the platform that you're describing?

17:40.120 --> 17:41.600
That is absolutely right.

17:41.600 --> 17:47.560
So, how this started is that when about a year ago, when we were looking at the applications,

17:47.560 --> 17:52.280
AT&T has deployed or about to deploy an AI machine learning.

17:52.280 --> 17:56.720
There were tens of, at least the ones that I have tracked, I'm sure there are plenty more.

17:56.720 --> 18:01.360
The one I've managed to track, there are tens of applications already deployed or about

18:01.360 --> 18:02.880
to be deployed.

18:02.880 --> 18:10.720
When I looked at those, is sort of every application supported by every business unit is different.

18:10.720 --> 18:18.200
It's different technology, different vendor, different tools, different operational support.

18:18.200 --> 18:23.320
And it was very clear that it just, if this is the direction we're going as a company

18:23.320 --> 18:28.200
and we absolutely are, it's just not possible to scale.

18:28.200 --> 18:32.480
It's straightforward to build one or to build two.

18:32.480 --> 18:38.600
But to go and build now and scale 20 and take 20 to 2000, you can't.

18:38.600 --> 18:43.080
It's just not possible without having some commonality, okay?

18:43.080 --> 18:50.560
So Acumos was really born as a result of that, thinking of AT&T as a customer, not as

18:50.560 --> 18:52.600
a builder of a platform.

18:52.600 --> 18:59.920
It was really built to try and solve three key problems that AT&T was being challenged.

18:59.920 --> 19:04.160
And we just discovered since then is that pretty much most companies are being challenged

19:04.160 --> 19:06.560
by those three problems.

19:06.560 --> 19:12.600
The first problem is there are a lot of tools out there for machine learning and AI.

19:12.600 --> 19:17.760
And you know, wait another week and somebody else is going to come out with another tool.

19:17.760 --> 19:19.440
And we love some of these tools.

19:19.440 --> 19:24.600
Some of them are very specialized in some markets, some of them are specialized by the company.

19:24.600 --> 19:25.800
They're great tools.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.320
There's no one size fits all.

19:28.320 --> 19:32.400
So the first problem we wanted to solve, even with an AT&T, we found out many people

19:32.400 --> 19:34.760
are using many tools.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.760
First we tried to force everybody to use one tool.

19:37.760 --> 19:42.640
We actually put out, you know, two, three years ago, an open source tool for machine learning

19:42.640 --> 19:46.040
and a statistical modeling called our cloud.

19:46.040 --> 19:50.600
And we were hoping to force everybody in AT&T to use it and frankly we failed.

19:50.600 --> 19:55.000
We ended up finding some people use it and some people like to use other tools that's

19:55.000 --> 19:57.000
you know, even built by AT&T.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Okay.

19:58.000 --> 20:05.160
So so we sort of we sort of moved away from that approach and we decided that the problem

20:05.160 --> 20:11.520
we need to solve with this Akimus number one, Akimus need to harmonize across all the

20:11.520 --> 20:12.680
tools.

20:12.680 --> 20:19.440
So if I use tool A and you use tool B, even though we may not be working with each other,

20:19.440 --> 20:21.880
we may not even talking to each other.

20:21.880 --> 20:28.280
But the output of my tool A and the output of your tool B need to be like Legos and not

20:28.280 --> 20:29.440
snowflakes.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.440
Okay.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.800
These things have to connect.

20:31.800 --> 20:36.240
These things have to have to sort of interoperate with each other.

20:36.240 --> 20:40.000
Not being sort of every tool is its own cycle.

20:40.000 --> 20:44.600
So that's number one thing that Akimus is attempting to sort of solve.

20:44.600 --> 20:48.160
And that's the problem we're trying to solve there, a higher minimization.

20:48.160 --> 20:51.840
The second problem we're trying to solve is that, and I think you know this very well,

20:51.840 --> 20:58.640
is that to build machine learning models or algorithms, it's very difficult.

20:58.640 --> 20:59.920
It's not easy to do.

20:59.920 --> 21:03.680
People talk about hiring PhDs and people will graduate degree.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.440
Well how many of them are there today?

21:05.440 --> 21:08.680
And how many companies require that skill set?

21:08.680 --> 21:09.680
Okay.

21:09.680 --> 21:13.600
I've been talking about lowering the barrier, making it easier.

21:13.600 --> 21:17.080
But you know what, it's never, has been easier.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.560
It's difficult.

21:18.560 --> 21:19.560
It's difficult to do.

21:19.560 --> 21:23.760
It requires some extensive understanding of the data.

21:23.760 --> 21:27.160
It requires extensive cleansing of the data.

21:27.160 --> 21:34.760
Why is you learning about some deep technologies, understanding what an ROC curve is, what a

21:34.760 --> 21:40.120
type one error, what a type two error is, it allows you to understand what is a gradient

21:40.120 --> 21:43.040
descent in neural network is.

21:43.040 --> 21:44.760
These are very deep things.

21:44.760 --> 21:49.240
And unless you go and take some deep courses and play with your favorite tool, whether it's

21:49.240 --> 21:54.720
scikit-learn or TensorFlow or cafe or whatever, you're not going to learn this, okay?

21:54.720 --> 21:56.760
And that's what they do in graduate degrees.

21:56.760 --> 22:02.600
So the second problem we wanted to solve with Akimus was that we need to lower the barrier

22:02.600 --> 22:04.320
to entry.

22:04.320 --> 22:13.240
So that if Mazin goes and build a model, and maybe Mazin takes weeks, uses GPUs and takes

22:13.240 --> 22:15.000
weeks to build that model.

22:15.000 --> 22:20.720
But then if Sam wants to go and use that model, it should be available in a marketplace.

22:20.720 --> 22:25.000
You should just grab and use and plug into somewhere.

22:25.000 --> 22:29.320
And so that the second thing Akimus provides is a marketplace.

22:29.320 --> 22:33.200
Is a marketplace that says, think of that the App Store.

22:33.200 --> 22:38.640
I can go somewhere, I can see what everybody else has built worldwide.

22:38.640 --> 22:44.000
And I could look at the review, the rating, and I can pick what I want.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.040
I don't have to rebuild it.

22:46.040 --> 22:48.120
We don't have to rebuild everything from scratch.

22:48.120 --> 22:50.360
It's very expensive to rebuild.

22:50.360 --> 22:55.000
We have to be thinking about reuse and improve as opposed to rebuild.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.280
So that's what is the Akimus marketplace.

22:57.280 --> 23:00.680
But what we do in the Akimus marketplace is more than an App Store.

23:00.680 --> 23:09.920
But it does also, it says, if I built something and Taylor built something else, then her capability

23:09.920 --> 23:14.720
and mine are microservices that we can just join together.

23:14.720 --> 23:18.000
We can actually put those two together like Legos.

23:18.000 --> 23:22.360
You can come in and connect what she has and what I have from the marketplace create a

23:22.360 --> 23:25.280
new application that didn't exist before.

23:25.280 --> 23:29.240
So these applications, these microservices are interoperable.

23:29.240 --> 23:34.640
And the third thing we wanted to solve is to say, when you build the model with any tool

23:34.640 --> 23:42.200
you want, I want to be able to deploy this model with any cloud and I want it to be minutes.

23:42.200 --> 23:45.480
And I don't want to learn what a Docker container is.

23:45.480 --> 23:48.200
I don't want to learn what Jenkins job is.

23:48.200 --> 23:51.200
I don't want to learn what a G or a ticket is.

23:51.200 --> 23:54.520
And I don't want to learn the internals of a third party cloud.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.840
It should be really like, I build it.

23:56.840 --> 24:01.560
I submit and it takes me all the way to it's running on a third party cloud.

24:01.560 --> 24:05.640
That's sort of, again, what Akumus is trying to do.

24:05.640 --> 24:06.640
Okay.

24:06.640 --> 24:08.440
There's a ton in there to dig into.

24:08.440 --> 24:13.920
I noticed on the Akumus page that there is an affiliation with the Linux foundation

24:13.920 --> 24:15.240
or at least a project.

24:15.240 --> 24:20.720
I'm assuming is the project is being kind of managed under the Linux foundation.

24:20.720 --> 24:25.880
Does that mean that for taking another step back?

24:25.880 --> 24:31.280
It sounds like a lot of the things that you described are almost outside of the realm

24:31.280 --> 24:37.120
of what we think about when we think of traditional AI machine learning tooling.

24:37.120 --> 24:42.720
It's more like the kinds of concerns that platform as a service has come along to try to

24:42.720 --> 24:43.720
help with.

24:43.720 --> 24:48.920
Is the implication of that in the Linux foundation involvement that this is built on cloud

24:48.920 --> 24:52.280
foundry or is taking a similar approach?

24:52.280 --> 24:55.440
So number one, you hit the nail on the head.

24:55.440 --> 25:02.280
This is Akumus is not competing with the tools, the many tools that's out there today.

25:02.280 --> 25:09.480
In fact, we want to encourage communities and companies to innovate and building the

25:09.480 --> 25:12.520
next big, better algorithm.

25:12.520 --> 25:18.440
How do you do deep learning now with a thousand layers instead of 20, 30 layers?

25:18.440 --> 25:22.920
How do you have trillion of neurons as opposed to a billion of neurons?

25:22.920 --> 25:29.160
We absolutely want companies and communities and industries and universities to innovate.

25:29.160 --> 25:34.760
We're trying to fill a gap, a gap that every company in the world, if they want to seriously

25:34.760 --> 25:38.640
look at AI machine learning, they have to fill.

25:38.640 --> 25:44.680
And today that gap is so large that you can hire the best PhDs and you still will never

25:44.680 --> 25:51.640
be able to scale deployment, adoption, and improvement of AI machine learning services.

25:51.640 --> 25:57.000
Linux Foundation, we have an incredible relationship with the Linux Foundation.

25:57.000 --> 26:03.320
We co-created Akumus with a partner of ours, Tech Mahendra, and we're hosting it under

26:03.320 --> 26:05.400
the Linux Foundation.

26:05.400 --> 26:09.240
Linux Foundation will host the marketplace and the platform.

26:09.240 --> 26:15.960
And we will work with the Linux Foundation to grow a community of companies and institutions

26:15.960 --> 26:24.360
and universities to really co-create together the foundation of how we want to scale and

26:24.360 --> 26:27.320
adopt AI globally.

26:27.320 --> 26:30.600
So we are already in discussions with a number of companies.

26:30.600 --> 26:34.240
So we don't consider this as an AT&T or a Tech Mahendra effort.

26:34.240 --> 26:39.960
We consider that we've started a seed and the Linux Foundation is going to help to grow

26:39.960 --> 26:47.400
that seed and really build a lot of beautiful trees with the help of a larger community.

26:47.400 --> 26:52.040
This isn't the first time we've seen things like this.

26:52.040 --> 26:57.200
It really reminds me a lot of, for example, what Intel was trying to do with their TAP platform.

26:57.200 --> 27:03.080
I don't know if you've ever come across that, but I'm not even sure they're still working

27:03.080 --> 27:04.080
on that.

27:04.080 --> 27:11.360
It's a huge problem where you're trying to integrate these many, many disparate components

27:11.360 --> 27:12.680
like lots of tools.

27:12.680 --> 27:18.080
In their case, I think they also built it on Cloud Foundry and then they had Hadoop and

27:18.080 --> 27:20.920
a bunch of data lakes stuff underneath.

27:20.920 --> 27:25.080
These are all very complex enterprise technologies.

27:25.080 --> 27:31.800
They're all evolving very rapidly in their own different directions.

27:31.800 --> 27:35.880
I guess my question is maybe pushing back on the whole idea of doing this.

27:35.880 --> 27:38.320
Why do you think you can succeed at this?

27:38.320 --> 27:43.360
It's such a Herculean task and so many have tried and failed.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.600
It's a great question.

27:45.600 --> 27:54.120
And frankly, if we don't solve this problem, if we don't solve this problem worldwide,

27:54.120 --> 28:00.880
the adoption of what you see in the media about AI and machine learning is very limited.

28:00.880 --> 28:05.960
It's going to be limited to a few companies who can afford to do it, a few companies who

28:05.960 --> 28:11.480
have the expertise and a few companies who can build one or two applications here and

28:11.480 --> 28:13.320
there.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.120
We have to solve this gap.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.120
It is a big gap.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.320
You're absolutely right.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.960
But I'll tell you what we are doing that's very different.

28:20.960 --> 28:24.280
And we have experience in this five years ago.

28:24.280 --> 28:30.480
We started with just as a big challenge as this one, as Akimos, which is we decided to

28:30.480 --> 28:37.240
completely convert the AT&T century sort of young network that's been developed over

28:37.240 --> 28:39.560
many, many decades.

28:39.560 --> 28:46.520
We decided to completely move that to a software defined using the best technology in SDN and

28:46.520 --> 28:48.520
virtualize the network function.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.760
So this is like the core of the network.

28:50.760 --> 28:56.000
You're now saying, I can build the core of a network like a web company where everything

28:56.000 --> 29:00.440
is software running on a cloud environment, commodity cloud hardware.

29:00.440 --> 29:02.400
That's just not possible.

29:02.400 --> 29:07.400
Well we went through that avenue and we started deploying that three years ago, but we

29:07.400 --> 29:10.680
realized a year ago there's something missing in here.

29:10.680 --> 29:15.720
What's missing is that we've invested significantly to making that happen.

29:15.720 --> 29:20.880
Hundreds of people, a lot of expertise, other companies can't do that, okay?

29:20.880 --> 29:23.320
And other operators cannot do that.

29:23.320 --> 29:29.120
And just having us doing something and operators are not, that's going to compromise the experience.

29:29.120 --> 29:32.200
That's going to also compromise the cost to the end customer.

29:32.200 --> 29:36.320
We need all operators, all vendors to be part of this.

29:36.320 --> 29:40.400
And so we made it open source under the Linux Foundation and there's something called

29:40.400 --> 29:41.640
ONAP.

29:41.640 --> 29:46.520
And in the short seven months, we've been at this journey this year.

29:46.520 --> 29:49.360
We have 50 plus companies.

29:49.360 --> 29:56.360
We have 1400 technical people co-developing from these companies.

29:56.360 --> 29:59.920
And we cover 55% of the global sub.

29:59.920 --> 30:04.880
These are the operators, the China mobiles, the China telecom, the Vodafone's, the Orange

30:04.880 --> 30:08.720
and Bel Canada and many of the brands that you basically hear about.

30:08.720 --> 30:15.800
We've cracked the code that the way to do it is that if we can all chip in and if we all

30:15.800 --> 30:21.680
can build thing, it build it together, we can create something better than anyone company

30:21.680 --> 30:24.160
trying it on their own.

30:24.160 --> 30:27.120
This is what we're trying to do the same thing with Akimas.

30:27.120 --> 30:32.680
This is if AT&T ends up the only one or AT&T and Tec Mahandra, the only one doing this,

30:32.680 --> 30:33.680
it will fail.

30:33.680 --> 30:36.440
I'll just tell you that flat face, okay?

30:36.440 --> 30:39.800
But what's going to be different in here, that's not what we're seeing from the companies

30:39.800 --> 30:40.800
we're talking to already.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.240
I can tell you that right now.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.720
What we're seeing is a tremendous momentum.

30:44.720 --> 30:46.720
They all realize the big gap.

30:46.720 --> 30:50.360
They all realize the big challenging gap that you're talking about.

30:50.360 --> 30:56.560
And by having a community come together and each of the companies chip into what they believe

30:56.560 --> 30:58.320
is important to them.

30:58.320 --> 31:03.560
So we will come in and say, well, what's going to work on our native cloud environment?

31:03.560 --> 31:06.480
And it's going to work on a couple of third party cloud that has to work.

31:06.480 --> 31:08.240
And it's going to do X, Y and Z.

31:08.240 --> 31:13.240
Other companies are coming in with slightly similar, what's different also attitude, bringing

31:13.240 --> 31:16.960
it all that together is really what's going to crack this.

31:16.960 --> 31:22.920
It's not going to be AT&T, it's going to be a community building it together.

31:22.920 --> 31:27.760
All of the times that's happened in the past, it's been one company trying to do it, trying

31:27.760 --> 31:29.360
to boil an ocean.

31:29.360 --> 31:32.960
What we're doing in here, there's no one company in the world can do it.

31:32.960 --> 31:36.840
It has to be a community, a global community efforts.

31:36.840 --> 31:37.840
Interesting.

31:37.840 --> 31:39.360
So you mentioned ONAP.

31:39.360 --> 31:44.440
This is maybe going a little bit deeper down this rabbit hole, but what's the relationship

31:44.440 --> 31:48.720
between ONAP, which I hadn't heard of, and OpenStack?

31:48.720 --> 31:56.200
I'm fairly familiar with AT&T's involvement over the years in OpenStack and in particular,

31:56.200 --> 32:00.440
working to build NFV deployments on top of OpenStack.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.440
Yeah.

32:01.440 --> 32:06.840
The two are already like brothers and sisters, the complimentary and brothers and sisters.

32:06.840 --> 32:11.840
OpenStack is the, we are a big user of OpenStack.

32:11.840 --> 32:17.680
We've built our AT&T integrated cloud platform based on OpenStack.

32:17.680 --> 32:24.440
So we take OpenStack, we're a significant part of OpenStack as part of the board as

32:24.440 --> 32:25.440
well.

32:25.440 --> 32:32.360
We ingest OpenStack and we build our AT&T cloud and this is what we use as the infrastructure

32:32.360 --> 32:35.120
to virtualize our network functions.

32:35.120 --> 32:38.840
So when I'm talking about virtualizing the network functions, moving our network to

32:38.840 --> 32:46.520
software defined, it's all using our cloud and sort of a hybrid cloud of our cloud and

32:46.520 --> 32:49.800
third-party cloud and OpenStack is a big part of that.

32:49.800 --> 32:55.280
ONAP, is it, once you have that, once you have these network functions and you have your

32:55.280 --> 33:00.880
cloud environment, well, you need to orchestrate these network functions.

33:00.880 --> 33:07.440
You need to automate the design and the testing and the deployment of those network functions.

33:07.440 --> 33:12.160
You need to do life cycle management of these network functions.

33:12.160 --> 33:15.800
Something could go wrong, they could be a threat, they could be a failure.

33:15.800 --> 33:23.600
So that is what ONAP does, it's an orchestration, automation, platform for both virtual and

33:23.600 --> 33:28.160
physical network functions and life cycle management.

33:28.160 --> 33:34.840
The two go together, you need ONAP on top of OpenStack and our AT&T integrated cloud to

33:34.840 --> 33:38.480
really try to virtualize these functions.

33:38.480 --> 33:53.040
Acumus and AI is a key sort of, a key enabler to enable both the cloud and the ONAP to automate

33:53.040 --> 33:55.160
functionalities.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.760
There are machine learning data driven.

33:57.760 --> 34:04.360
So if ONAP comes in and says, I want to use data driven capabilities to predict there's

34:04.360 --> 34:09.400
going to be a failure in the network in a particular location for a particular customer

34:09.400 --> 34:11.920
an hour from now.

34:11.920 --> 34:17.960
That's where machine learning and acumus comes in is creating these predictive, sophisticated

34:17.960 --> 34:27.040
capabilities to make the ONAP and the integrated cloud data driven and predictable and have

34:27.040 --> 34:28.840
a predictive capabilities.

34:28.840 --> 34:34.320
I actually very keen on digging a little deeper into some of these network and operations

34:34.320 --> 34:40.480
use cases, but I do have one question on acumus before we do that.

34:40.480 --> 34:47.480
I noticed or didn't notice the lack of on the acumus page a link to like a GitHub repository

34:47.480 --> 34:48.760
or something like that.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.800
What stage is acumus in?

34:50.800 --> 34:55.480
Is it a vision or is there more, something more tangible to it today that folks can get

34:55.480 --> 34:56.480
access to?

34:56.480 --> 35:00.120
I always start with a vision, but what it is, it's not just a vision.

35:00.120 --> 35:06.040
If it was a vision, then we wouldn't be having the conversation, I'll be honest with you.

35:06.040 --> 35:11.200
We believe you have to have something real, but this is a community effort.

35:11.200 --> 35:15.920
Like you said, technology is changing a lot, but there's some basic foundation you have

35:15.920 --> 35:16.920
to build.

35:16.920 --> 35:23.000
What we've done is we announced this a couple of weeks ago or whatever, 10 days ago.

35:23.000 --> 35:30.040
Next week, literally next week, we're moving all the software to the Linux foundation.

35:30.040 --> 35:36.320
We built the software, we built the seed capabilities of everything I talked to you about.

35:36.320 --> 35:40.960
The seed software of everything I talked about is being built, and we're moving it to

35:40.960 --> 35:42.720
the Linux foundation next week.

35:42.720 --> 35:48.560
We believe that the Linux foundation, they're going to set it up and set up their CICD

35:48.560 --> 35:52.760
environment and testing environments by December, mid-December.

35:52.760 --> 35:57.240
We believe, and again, that's up to the Linux foundation to make it available, but initially

35:57.240 --> 36:04.360
it will be available for friendly companies who are going to be joining the project, and

36:04.360 --> 36:10.200
early next year, in one queue next year, it's going to be available to the public.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.200
Okay.

36:11.200 --> 36:12.840
Well, I'll definitely be following along.

36:12.840 --> 36:19.600
It sounds like an interesting project, and I can definitely, there's no question that

36:19.600 --> 36:21.560
the need is there.

36:21.560 --> 36:24.680
But it's, again, it's a huge challenge.

36:24.680 --> 36:27.600
So network and operations.

36:27.600 --> 36:34.320
I think maybe the most famous, maybe the most public kind of proof point, example point

36:34.320 --> 36:39.200
here is some of the work that Google has done in this area where they showed that they

36:39.200 --> 36:44.800
were able to reduce their cost of, I don't remember if it was the overall cost of data

36:44.800 --> 36:49.720
center operations, or they're the heating and cooling costs by some 40%.

36:49.720 --> 36:52.840
This is going back a year and change ago.

36:52.840 --> 36:57.880
That's certainly, you know, certainly there are huge opportunities there for AT&T.

36:57.880 --> 37:00.200
How are you attacking that space?

37:00.200 --> 37:03.200
Yeah, it's a key space for us.

37:03.200 --> 37:13.080
So number one, we probably have more data centers than many companies that I know today in

37:13.080 --> 37:14.400
the United States.

37:14.400 --> 37:19.600
We own different types of data centers from small to large to support our customers.

37:19.600 --> 37:25.440
So when you start thinking about how does this all come together, first is that all the

37:25.440 --> 37:30.920
capabilities in these data centers, first have to be software.

37:30.920 --> 37:35.280
They have to be software running on cloud commodity hardware.

37:35.280 --> 37:41.160
If you don't do that, then it's pretty much difficult to do anything else, including

37:41.160 --> 37:43.400
artificial intelligence and acrimus.

37:43.400 --> 37:46.000
You can't, unless you move to a software world.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.880
And we've been doing that for the past five years, and that's part of this own app

37:49.880 --> 37:52.080
effort that I just talked to you about.

37:52.080 --> 37:55.480
We are basically going in that directions.

37:55.480 --> 38:01.880
But where we are applying the technology in our data centers and we will continue to doubling

38:01.880 --> 38:09.280
down in this space from a machine learning perspective and an AI perspective is not just

38:09.280 --> 38:13.320
about energy consumption, which is the example that you gave.

38:13.320 --> 38:16.640
Although that by itself is a big opportunity.

38:16.640 --> 38:18.840
I don't want to minimize that.

38:18.840 --> 38:26.600
But there are tremendous inefficiencies one can apply machine learning and AI to really

38:26.600 --> 38:30.880
do something cheaper, faster, and better.

38:30.880 --> 38:36.360
And combine that with human expertise, you could really sort of combine the best of both

38:36.360 --> 38:37.360
well.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.560
So doing something that we just can't even do today.

38:40.560 --> 38:47.760
So we're not just applying it to looking at energy saving, but there are tremendous opportunities

38:47.760 --> 38:51.960
in terms of operating these data centers.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.680
There are many functions in these data centers.

38:54.680 --> 39:00.400
Just think of, you know, we as a network company, we support the world here.

39:00.400 --> 39:06.000
And there are switches, there are routers, there are firewalls.

39:06.000 --> 39:11.560
This is the core core of our network of how packets go from A to B.

39:11.560 --> 39:14.120
That's sort of the basics here.

39:14.120 --> 39:19.960
All of these have to be automated and it has to be done in such a way that is intelligent.

39:19.960 --> 39:22.440
So I'll give you a simple example.

39:22.440 --> 39:28.560
At every second of the day in the United States, traffic changes.

39:28.560 --> 39:32.120
And in some cases, we know and we predict that.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.320
In some cases, we don't know.

39:34.320 --> 39:38.960
Suddenly, there is a big event happening in a particular location, a particular city,

39:38.960 --> 39:44.240
in a particular corner that just doesn't happen any day or any year, okay?

39:44.240 --> 39:51.560
So part of what we apply machine learning in AI is to really dynamically configure our

39:51.560 --> 39:55.400
network and our resources around the clock.

39:55.400 --> 40:01.120
So I use this metaphor as the think of like we're building a virtual city.

40:01.120 --> 40:08.960
That's the United States where we have limited capacity, but the roads, the roads can become

40:08.960 --> 40:14.120
narrower or wider as long as the physical space is the same.

40:14.120 --> 40:19.040
And how wide or narrow you make that is can change every second of a day.

40:19.040 --> 40:23.280
And that's what we're using machine learning in AI to say, well, how much capacity can I put

40:23.280 --> 40:28.200
in that second of a day there because we're predicting some traffic is going to be there

40:28.200 --> 40:31.100
over the next one hour or five hours, okay?

40:31.100 --> 40:33.280
And where do I take capacity from?

40:33.280 --> 40:36.760
But imagine doing that and optimizing that around the clock.

40:36.760 --> 40:39.360
That's a big, big undertaking.

40:39.360 --> 40:44.400
So that's just one other example where we're applying these capabilities.

40:44.400 --> 40:49.800
Are there some other specific examples or use cases that come to mind within the context

40:49.800 --> 40:51.040
of networking ops?

40:51.040 --> 40:52.440
Yeah.

40:52.440 --> 40:56.560
So another example is that, so imagine a firewall goes down.

40:56.560 --> 40:57.560
What do you do?

40:57.560 --> 41:03.320
All days you, it's failed, somebody has to literally go there, has to remove it, put a new

41:03.320 --> 41:06.680
device in there, new firewall, okay?

41:06.680 --> 41:10.640
And plug everything in, test it, makes it work, could take days, could take weeks depending

41:10.640 --> 41:14.160
if there are extra hardware available, et cetera.

41:14.160 --> 41:16.440
Today, that's completely different.

41:16.440 --> 41:23.120
It's number one, I can spin up the firewall or that switch at any point of the day, okay?

41:23.120 --> 41:24.120
In any location.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.120
That's number one.

41:25.120 --> 41:28.680
That's the vision of what we're going after and we started already excluding on that

41:28.680 --> 41:29.680
vision.

41:29.680 --> 41:35.160
We're reaching about 55% of our target network in terms of virtualization by the end of

41:35.160 --> 41:36.720
this year, okay?

41:36.720 --> 41:42.360
So now, once I can put these capabilities there, the problem happens is that, okay, well

41:42.360 --> 41:44.800
what happens now if it goes down?

41:44.800 --> 41:50.080
Well, what we're implementing today is what we call it an AI closed loop, which means

41:50.080 --> 41:55.680
that we have the capability of extracting data from this, let's say, firewall.

41:55.680 --> 42:00.840
We're able to process and this data using machine learning.

42:00.840 --> 42:07.440
We're able to predict if there are some failures, maybe happening, or some degradation.

42:07.440 --> 42:12.080
We are able to apply policies to say, okay, well, we know there's something going on that's

42:12.080 --> 42:13.640
bad, okay?

42:13.640 --> 42:16.200
We know the driver is this, what do I do?

42:16.200 --> 42:19.480
It could be that, well, rebuild the firewall, okay?

42:19.480 --> 42:23.120
And then we need an action to go and take that action, okay?

42:23.120 --> 42:26.200
Today, that's a manual effort.

42:26.200 --> 42:32.080
Tickets are being, you know, we developed tickets, thousands of tickets around the clock,

42:32.080 --> 42:36.680
hoping that a human is an expert is going to look at those tickets and take an action.

42:36.680 --> 42:41.040
But really, a good portion of those tickets are things we already know.

42:41.040 --> 42:42.520
We've learned from the data.

42:42.520 --> 42:44.960
We know what's a good action, what a bad action.

42:44.960 --> 42:49.160
That's where AI comes in is learning the good action from the bad action.

42:49.160 --> 42:54.760
And being able to automate and do this closed loop in a complete automated way, which could

42:54.760 --> 42:58.280
be reboots, it could be just move the traffic.

42:58.280 --> 43:03.240
There's something chronic about the device, move the traffic and stand up traffic, stand

43:03.240 --> 43:07.400
at the applications in another device or another firewall.

43:07.400 --> 43:12.040
And that's sort of, again, you can think of the same thing we're doing with security.

43:12.040 --> 43:16.320
There are many, many applications like this we are investigating today.

43:16.320 --> 43:24.520
From taking a step back from a portfolio perspective, how do you kind of manage the investments

43:24.520 --> 43:28.240
across all of these various opportunities that you have?

43:28.240 --> 43:30.080
Yeah, that's a good, great question.

43:30.080 --> 43:38.320
I mean, it's a number one, the reason why we are building a platform, we've done this

43:38.320 --> 43:40.600
for our virtualized cloud.

43:40.600 --> 43:43.120
Companies are doing that too for their virtualized cloud.

43:43.120 --> 43:48.400
We're doing this for our orchestration and automation platform, the own app and what

43:48.400 --> 43:51.200
we call it, e-comm inside AT&T.

43:51.200 --> 43:53.360
We're doing this for machine learning and AI.

43:53.360 --> 43:59.840
First, you've got to make sure the foundation is built once, developed by a community in

43:59.840 --> 44:04.040
an open transparent way, but it's built once and evolved.

44:04.040 --> 44:08.840
It's not changed every time from an investment that's just prohibitive, okay?

44:08.840 --> 44:10.040
That's number one.

44:10.040 --> 44:16.240
Number two, anything that sits on top of that investment, we're sort of making sure it

44:16.240 --> 44:23.360
is software and making sure that you could take an investment that we already have and drive

44:23.360 --> 44:27.360
that cost down with this new world of machine learning and software.

44:27.360 --> 44:33.800
So every opportunity I talk to you about, it's not a vision and it's not something we would

44:33.800 --> 44:34.800
like to do.

44:34.800 --> 44:38.440
It's something we're doing today because there is billions of dollars.

44:38.440 --> 44:44.240
We have a business case that says, if we do this through software and through own app

44:44.240 --> 44:49.120
and through machine learning, we can say 50% of the cost.

44:49.120 --> 44:54.440
So we're going after those where there are billions attached and with a technology and

44:54.440 --> 44:59.160
the business case shows we can really shave a lot out of these investments, whether it's

44:59.160 --> 45:01.640
capital investments or expense.

45:01.640 --> 45:08.640
Certainly, AT&T has more resources available to it than many companies, but those resources

45:08.640 --> 45:11.280
nonetheless are not unlimited.

45:11.280 --> 45:18.280
What are the biggest challenges that you're finding in attacking your wish list?

45:18.280 --> 45:22.960
I'm imagining that you've got way more places that you'd like to apply this technology

45:22.960 --> 45:26.760
than you can actually take on at any given time.

45:26.760 --> 45:27.760
Yeah.

45:27.760 --> 45:34.480
Beyond the platform is a gaming like we've talked about that and I totally agree that in

45:34.480 --> 45:39.040
the situation that you've described, building out a platform that lowers the barrier to

45:39.040 --> 45:48.440
entry for other parts of the organization to build on top of is a great place to start.

45:48.440 --> 45:53.760
But then what are the other barriers that if you can figure out how to fix those, you

45:53.760 --> 45:57.680
would be able to accelerate your adoption?

45:57.680 --> 46:03.600
So number one is that every company and where no different has limited resources and that's

46:03.600 --> 46:04.600
number one.

46:04.600 --> 46:06.640
Number two, we're not doing it alone.

46:06.640 --> 46:11.560
We cannot do it alone, independent of even if you have the resources, it's you need the

46:11.560 --> 46:17.320
skill set and subject matter expertise in different areas, network expertise and functions

46:17.320 --> 46:21.400
that we may have some, but not others.

46:21.400 --> 46:29.640
The challenge here is ensuring the ecosystem we work with, the suppliers, the vendors,

46:29.640 --> 46:37.120
the partners that we do active engagement with today, all of us are working with the same

46:37.120 --> 46:41.480
framework, with the same DNA, with the same sort of platform.

46:41.480 --> 46:44.760
That is really how it's a win-win for everybody.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.640
So that's number one challenge.

46:46.640 --> 46:51.840
We've done a lot of progress in that, which led us to where we are today, but that is

46:51.840 --> 46:58.480
definitely a challenge is getting everybody to go into sort of one path and using something

46:58.480 --> 46:59.480
coming.

46:59.480 --> 47:05.920
Imagine that if every car manufacturers build their car without any specifications, without

47:05.920 --> 47:09.600
any sort of blueprints, it's going to be very expensive.

47:09.600 --> 47:15.000
But today, all cars come with literally sort of four wheels maybe, they have a steering,

47:15.000 --> 47:19.960
they have a seat, there are some expectations that every car has to have, but every car

47:19.960 --> 47:21.760
manufacturers compete differently.

47:21.760 --> 47:26.640
Well, imagine if that was not the case, if there were no specifications, then every car

47:26.640 --> 47:29.720
has to be built so differently from scratch.

47:29.720 --> 47:32.040
It costs a lot of money to build that car.

47:32.040 --> 47:37.800
Today, that's not the case and car manufacturers have managed to get all their sort of suppliers

47:37.800 --> 47:39.040
and vendors to align.

47:39.040 --> 47:40.960
We're trying to do the same thing here.

47:40.960 --> 47:47.120
This is a journey, AT&T is a leader in this journey from the networking side.

47:47.120 --> 47:52.400
When you look at all the operators, we went to open source also to bring in other operators

47:52.400 --> 47:58.840
into this game and work with them together so that it's a win-win for both of us.

47:58.840 --> 48:05.800
That's a key challenge is harmonization, which is lead us to the relationship we have with

48:05.800 --> 48:11.480
the Linux Foundation as a partner to help us drive harmonization worldwide.

48:11.480 --> 48:16.040
Well, you certainly shared a lot of jewels with us.

48:16.040 --> 48:22.160
Are there any other thoughts that you want to share with the audience on, if they're

48:22.160 --> 48:27.040
trying to figure this all out, maybe where they should start or what they should do or

48:27.040 --> 48:32.280
any other thoughts on any thoughts that you'd like to close us out with?

48:32.280 --> 48:33.280
Sure.

48:33.280 --> 48:40.000
Number one, I think that no matter which company you're from and no matter what investment

48:40.000 --> 48:43.520
you have, don't build your own thing.

48:43.520 --> 48:49.560
You have to decide what is a value at your company and a competitive edge for you versus

48:49.560 --> 48:52.960
something that is really should be just mainstream.

48:52.960 --> 48:57.920
So number one is that be part of an open source movement.

48:57.920 --> 49:00.800
Join us in the networking side, join us in ONA.

49:00.800 --> 49:05.680
If you are in the machine learning AI side, don't invest in your own silos.

49:05.680 --> 49:12.520
Join us in a community so that your investment is multiplied by a factor of 100 with other

49:12.520 --> 49:13.520
people's investments.

49:13.520 --> 49:16.160
Don't do it alone.

49:16.160 --> 49:17.840
That's sort of number one.

49:17.840 --> 49:23.880
It's be part of the open source and really keep your secret sauce, but trying to use your

49:23.880 --> 49:26.960
investment plus others to build something that's phenomenal.

49:26.960 --> 49:34.600
Number two is as we build the foundation altogether, I think Sky is the limit in terms

49:34.600 --> 49:36.120
of the applications.

49:36.120 --> 49:39.160
We're just touching the surface of that.

49:39.160 --> 49:45.040
I know everyone talks about things like voice recognition and facial detection.

49:45.040 --> 49:47.560
These are wonderful.

49:47.560 --> 49:50.040
These are great applications.

49:50.040 --> 49:52.720
Research in these applications started three, four decades ago.

49:52.720 --> 49:55.960
If you go back to the 70s, 80s, that's how it started.

49:55.960 --> 50:00.840
And today we are at a point where we can commercialize, but there are a lot of opportunities of

50:00.840 --> 50:01.840
applications.

50:01.840 --> 50:07.960
We haven't even thought of applications, especially as we get to 5G and the Internet of

50:07.960 --> 50:16.080
Things and Edge Cloud and applications that none of us have even conceived they existed.

50:16.080 --> 50:22.040
We would love to expedite that innovations and that inventions and we would love everyone

50:22.040 --> 50:28.800
to really be part of the movement and not to take a sideline and watch.

50:28.800 --> 50:29.880
This is a big movement.

50:29.880 --> 50:35.400
This is going to change the future of the industry worldwide.

50:35.400 --> 50:36.400
Get involved.

50:36.400 --> 50:37.560
Well, that's great.

50:37.560 --> 50:38.560
That's great.

50:38.560 --> 50:43.000
