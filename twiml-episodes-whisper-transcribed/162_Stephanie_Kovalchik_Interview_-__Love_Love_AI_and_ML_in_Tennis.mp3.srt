00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:31,680
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:37,040
In this the final episode of our AI and sports series, I'm joined by Stephanie Kovalczyk,

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,360
Research Fellow at Victoria University and Senior Sports Scientist at Tennis Australia.

6
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,440
Stephanie and I had a great conversation about a few of the many interesting projects

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,360
underway at Tennis Australia.

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,840
We start out taking a look at their use of data to develop a player rating system based

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,400
on ability and probability as opposed to the current official one which is based on

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,280
points scored and match results.

11
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,360
We then get into some of the interesting products her game insight group is developing, including

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,480
a win forecasting algorithm and a statistic that measures a given player's workload during

13
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,120
a match.

14
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:18,560
Stephanie details her paper, is there a Pythagorean theorem for winning in tennis which

15
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,200
explores the development and application of a Pythagorean theorem for win expectation

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,720
in tennis.

17
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,440
We also take a look at her project to develop a system for classifying ending shots and

18
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,840
an emotion tracking system that helps show the link between emotion and performance in

19
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,840
tennis.

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,520
All right, on to the show.

21
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,440
All right everyone, I am on the line with Stephanie Kovalczyk.

22
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:48,320
Stephanie is a Research Fellow at Victoria University and Senior Sports Scientist at Tennis

23
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
Australia.

24
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,000
Stephanie, welcome to this weekend machine learning and AI.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,200
Hi Sam, thanks for happy me.

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,200
Absolutely.

27
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,200
Why don't we get started by talking a little bit about your background.

28
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,080
You've got a background in statistics, but you're applying that to the field of tennis

29
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,080
now.

30
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,080
How did that come about?

31
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,240
Yeah, it's kind of an interesting one.

32
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:16,120
I guess to go way back, I was always really interested in science and so I knew definitely

33
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:23,040
that I wanted a career in science, but I actually started out kind of more interested in neuroscience

34
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
when I was an undergrad.

35
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:30,400
I was looking into biology and really thought the brain and how it worked was fascinating.

36
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,960
So I kind of thought I was going to do that.

37
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:42,720
I was at Caltech and then I spent a year after graduating, just doing pure research and

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,880
I was collecting data and starting to analyze it and it was at that point that I realized

39
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:55,960
how important stats were to science and reaching conclusions and I really just wanted

40
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,680
to do that all of the time.

41
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:06,440
So then I looked to see what programs I might go into and I found a great one at UCL

42
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:15,720
today, so I went over there and finished my master's in PhD there and I was actually in

43
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,720
bio-stat.

44
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,520
So I was very applied a lot of focus on applications and statistics to health and things like clinical

45
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:32,920
trial design and studying diseases and after that I went to the National Cancer Institute

46
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,440
actually did a fellowship there and it was all focused on risk prediction, but that was

47
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:45,200
kind of my first place where I got it, I retased a real model building and with an important

48
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,440
practical outcome where our whole goal was to try to help doctors and patients better

49
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,440
assess their risk for different types of cancer and learned a lot just about the different

50
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:04,400
approaches, particularly more from kind of the epidemiological point of view.

51
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,640
So so far you're probably wondering where is the sports angle in all of this.

52
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:17,640
I was on a very kind of health statistician track and on the side, it's a classic story

53
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:24,720
in sports statistics where it's like the hobbyist goes home and spends all of their evenings

54
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:33,840
just scraping data and calculating percentages and that's that's literally what happened.

55
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,040
I mean more after grad school once I kind of had enough of a foundation and I was always

56
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:44,960
watching time as I just loved love the sport my whole life and and I was starting to watch

57
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:51,840
it from that that perspective and you know at that point like the whole money ball era

58
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:58,600
in sport was like well underway but it never had really reached tennis and I was just confused

59
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:04,040
why you know why weren't we seeing that same kind of advance and I started looking on

60
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,800
the web to see what kind of data was available in the sport and there was actually quite a

61
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,840
lot at least when you're thinking of the kinds of data you might want for like building

62
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:19,320
a rating system for for players for example you could do that for all of the you know

63
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:27,080
the open era history in tennis just from publicly available data so so I started to take

64
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:32,120
on like kind of small projects but it grew over time and then I was starting to present

65
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,680
at sports conferences and eventually that was how I learned about the role at tennis

66
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:47,160
Australia meeting another sports sports scientist that was working working there and that

67
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,840
was the first time that I realized that somebody could work full time on sports doing statistics

68
00:05:54,840 --> 00:06:01,080
I figured you had to be doing it in baseball or basketball I yeah I just wasn't even

69
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,360
really pursuing that as a career I just thought it would always be this passion the side

70
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,680
passion yeah so luckily I turned out that I just didn't realize the opportunities and

71
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,680
kind of stumbled on one and I've been in in that role for two and a half years now and

72
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:26,520
yeah it's really a dream situation that's fantastic did you play competitively growing

73
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,960
up or in college or something like that in high school I mean that that was about the extent

74
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:38,280
of my ability but it was one of those things where like first sport that I really learned with

75
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,640
my dad and you know so it kind of had a special place and and there's something appealing just

76
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:49,720
about the individual nature of it you know you're you're out there and you're totally alone I mean

77
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,200
there's nobody that's going to help you with any of the decision-making and and so I think that

78
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,960
really lends itself to kind of you know and interesting drama and stories that that make

79
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:06,200
you know the whole journey of individual players that much more interesting you mentioned using

80
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:13,960
open data to come up with a rating system now as I understand it tennis has a well-established

81
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:21,080
formal rating system what would be the relationship between that type of the formal system and one

82
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:28,120
that you'd come up with with openly available data yeah so tennis does have official rankings

83
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:37,640
and those are based on a point-based method where players basically rack up points based on

84
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:43,880
their performance at individual tournaments and the bigger the tournament the more points they get

85
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:49,720
and the deeper that they go in that event the more points that they get but it's not actually tied

86
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:57,080
in any statistical way to the expectations about what they should be doing and how difficult

87
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:05,160
their opponent is so one one thing that statisticians working in tennis have been interested in

88
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:13,640
is whether if you have an approach that is based sort of on the probabilities around individual

89
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:19,800
match results if that would give you a better assessment of a player's overall ability because

90
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,640
it's directly tied to what they're expected to do and how they're actually performing so as an

91
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:32,520
example an alternative to the official rankings would be an ELO based system and that would be an

92
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:40,360
example of one that's a probability based way of measuring player ability it can also be applied

93
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:47,560
to teams and in fact is used by a number of of professional teams it was actually developed

94
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:53,400
originally for chess for rating chess players but that's a system that's really it's really

95
00:08:53,400 --> 00:09:03,240
well established and and my group we have shown that it does outperform the official rankings

96
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:10,200
just in terms of the assessment of player performance so if you use it to evaluate how a player's

97
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,320
likely to perform in the future so use it as a basis for forecasting their future results

98
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,800
it does a better job than than models based off of official rankings so yeah so that's

99
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:28,840
one reason to to prefer it and you can also do fun stuff like look at surface specific versions

100
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,280
you can try to focus more on player's services return which is kind of an offensive defense

101
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:40,360
of type of breakdown so it's something that's there's stuff I think more more research questions

102
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:47,320
around even improving the current systems that are used but all of those possible improvements

103
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:55,400
can be done with with open data so Stephanie you work as a data scientist as part of the game

104
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:03,000
insight group at tennis Australia what exactly does that group do and what's your day-to-day role

105
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:11,080
as a data scientist there yeah um gig as we call it is sort of an academic industry partnership

106
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:20,280
so that's my two hats doing research at Victoria University and then being part of this research

107
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,360
group with tennis Australia so tennis Australia Victoria came together they realized that there

108
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:35,240
was this real opportunity in tennis to advance what's being done with with data that's available

109
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:41,880
and so the game insight group is really an initiative to try to take advantage of that that

110
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:50,520
opportunity so it's it's a research and development group that's we include a number of of data

111
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:56,360
scientists and we spend all of our time just focusing on questions of interest in how can we

112
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,600
understand you know why some athletes in tennis do better than others I mean ultimately we're

113
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:10,920
trying to kind of crack that question um and so we have a number of areas of research and then we

114
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,960
get the chance to actually create products out of those as well so there's kind of a large

115
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:21,480
translational component to what we do where we're trying to not only address questions that are

116
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:28,440
of interest to us sort of as you know academics and researchers but that we think the results of

117
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:36,440
pursuing that research could directly impact the sport and and have benefit back to how athletes

118
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:45,320
are training how coaches are making decisions about their development um so that's one of the

119
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:51,400
really exciting things about about the role is that translational piece and um yeah so we

120
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:58,280
um are spending a lot of our time doing what you might typically think of with a researcher

121
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:05,880
at at a university but then we also get the chance to participate with events try to bring stats

122
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:13,400
to life in actual matches um for fans and then work with players and coaches to help them

123
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,040
as they're you know trying to pursue their performance objectives

124
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:24,920
what's an example of one of the products that you've been able to create in the role

125
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,240
so we have a number of stats actually that we debuted this year at the Australian Open that's

126
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,640
kind of our marquee event as you might imagine being at Melbourne Park and so that included a win

127
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:47,640
forecasting approach which allowed us to let fans know what each player's chances were of

128
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,760
winning the match at any point in time and to contrast that with where they were at the start so

129
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,040
it kind of gives you an interesting idea about um the momentum over the course of a match

130
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:05,960
we also had a work stat that we introduced which I was really excited about because tennis is a very

131
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:12,120
physical game there's so much interest in how uh players how much effort they're making during

132
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:18,520
matches and how that's affecting their performance but we don't actually have a lot of stats um

133
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:26,840
around the physicality um of actual match play so we have worked on a work stat that basically

134
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:34,040
gives you an comprehensive look at how much um physical effort players are making

135
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,600
primarily in their lower body so by running around on changes of direction

136
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,400
accelerations decelerations we take all of that into account to come up with this overall work

137
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,480
measure and so that's another thing that's fun to look at um how different the two players in

138
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:56,760
any particular matchup are as as a match progresses so every year yeah we are looking for new metrics

139
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:04,040
that will give um kind of a new perspective to uh to the sport and those were some examples that

140
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,520
we introduced this year that sounds really interesting can you talk a little bit more about that

141
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:14,600
work set uh where does the data for example will come from so that's one that's based off of

142
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:21,640
tracking data which has kind of been a new thing it's if you look just across sports more broadly

143
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:28,680
tracking data is kind of the um the Holy Grail um for her sport statistician because it

144
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,080
represents some of the highest quality information that's out there about performance

145
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:41,640
um in tennis it became um more available with the introduction of the player challenge system

146
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:47,720
which is a multi camera system that sits on courts and tracks the ball throughout a match

147
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:54,040
and it allows players to be able to review line calls if they think there's been an error made

148
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:00,120
they get to use a challenge and then there's sort of a video graphic representation of where

149
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,960
that particular shot landed with respect to the lines for that to happen but yeah for that to

150
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:11,960
happen there's all this data being generated about the um position of the ball and space at any

151
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:19,800
point in time and it also has information about the player locations as well so uh gig we have um

152
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:28,040
access to uh that tracking data for the Australian Open Series events um so for that that part of

153
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,680
the calendar we get a comprehensive look at the physical characteristics of shots and player

154
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:42,760
movement um and so that would represent all hardcore matches um and we have that going back

155
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:49,320
to like 2012 so that's been a big area of development for us is like what what is size can we get

156
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:58,440
out of those data that we can use um in our player services or in um enhancing the experience out

157
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:06,840
events and thinking about that that data source multiple cameras different angles it strikes me

158
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:12,680
that there are a ton of interesting machine learning and AI types of challenges in there to go

159
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:19,400
from that to you know some kind of representation of a player position or even player foot positions

160
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:26,200
that will allow you to get to things like acceleration and distance covered and all these things um

161
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:32,040
is that processing of the the video to get to some of the positional information are you involved

162
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:37,960
in that or is that done upstream to you and you get more refined information we're not actually

163
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:43,480
collecting those data or producing those data ourselves that's done by the company that's

164
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:49,640
responsible for um providing that challenge the player challenge system which is Hawkeye who's

165
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:56,680
now part of Sony and they actually are that data provider for um other sports as well like they

166
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:04,440
provide a video review system for cricket for example um so they're the they're the data provider

167
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:13,240
and um what we end up getting from those are um summaries of the um it's effectively arcs

168
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:20,840
of the movement of the ball so a typical shot will have two two arcs and those are described

169
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:29,560
with uh polynomials polynomial functions in 3D space so you get a uh summary function um but

170
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:35,640
it's at a very uh fine level of detail and from that you can derive a number of of interesting

171
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:43,800
things like the ball speed at any point in time um it's height it's you know angular characteristics um

172
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,120
so that's the data that we're provided so it's not exactly wrong the sense that you're not looking

173
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:54,520
at like coordinates in space it's in a summary form but it's still quite um quite granular

174
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:01,880
okay you mentioned earlier player acceleration and i'm trying to envision how you might derive

175
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,720
that from ball positions can you elaborate on that yeah so for the players we actually have a

176
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:14,280
2D coordinate of um the position of their stance so it's effectively in like the midpoint of

177
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:23,160
their stance at any point in time um and that is tracked at like 25 hertz so you get 25 samples

178
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:30,840
per second of um of their um x y position okay and so it's from that that we would derive

179
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,760
anything around the player movement got it got it super interesting i i did have a question from

180
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:43,560
your uh from looking at some of your publications on your website you one of your uh recent articles

181
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:50,280
is is there a Pythagorean theorem for winning in tennis and uh in looking into that a little

182
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:54,920
bit like i didn't realize that Pythagorean theorems and sports was a thing but it sounds like

183
00:18:54,920 --> 00:19:00,040
it's a whole it's a whole thing can you talk a little bit about the background and uh implications

184
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:07,160
of all that yeah it's actually a fun one kind of historically in in sports stats because it was one

185
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:15,480
of the um one of the things that Bill James who's kind of now become like this you know godfather

186
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:22,200
of sports statistics one of the the things that um one of his major contributions to baseball

187
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:27,560
statistics was the development of this Pythagorean theorem or sometimes you'll see it called the

188
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:34,840
Pythagorean expectation so sports edificions spend a lot of their time thinking about how can they

189
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:41,000
forecast outcomes in the sport because if you can do that usually means it gives you a better

190
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,920
understanding of why some succeed and others don't and that's ultimately you know a central

191
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:55,960
question to a lot of uh what we do um so the Pythagorean theorem is one approach to looking at

192
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,520
i'm getting the spreadsheet thing again okay sorry that's okay i'm just i'm sorry i was trying

193
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,440
to manage my dog down there and i think the mic moved around uh should i start uh back

194
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:15,400
sure sure um so the Pythagorean theorem it's it's an interesting one historically because it was

195
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:24,280
one of the major contributions of of Bill James who's become the sort of godfather of sports statistics

196
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:32,040
and what he looked at was a question around you know how could you try to determine if a a team

197
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:39,160
let's say is midway in their their season what they're likely um overall win percentage is going

198
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:47,480
to be at the end of the season and so looking at that problem he he developed this Pythagorean

199
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:56,280
expectation and what i was interested in is whether a similar idea um in a similar relationship

200
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:05,400
existed in tennis so the main thought behind it is that um you know how do you get a win

201
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:13,080
and in most sports it usually means earning more points in some sense than your opponent um so in

202
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:20,040
baseball it's runs it's all about you know being ahead of your opponent and runs the Pythagorean

203
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:27,480
expectation shows that actually if you look at the runs earned by a team over the course of a season

204
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:33,560
against the runs that their opponents have earned against them and you take the square of those

205
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:42,440
that that ratio between the teams runs earned squared against the sum of um that quantity and their

206
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:50,840
opponents uh runs earned is actually quite accurate of setting expectations for what a team's

207
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:57,000
overall win record is going to look like in the long term so that's where this the Pythagorean

208
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,400
label comes from because if you look at these squared terms it looks a little bit like the

209
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:08,760
relationship between the sides of a triangle so yeah so James was working at that like in the 80s

210
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:15,800
which you know that's like ancient times from sports stats perspective um and since then a lot

211
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:20,840
of other statisticians have looked to see if if similar relationships exist in their sport because

212
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:25,240
you know we're most of us are all in that situation of like you're just trying to earn more points

213
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:31,880
so maybe there's kind of a similar similar thing that you can find and there have been applications

214
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:39,080
of it in basketball hockey and um and it holds up although the exponent the sort of optimal

215
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:45,240
exponent um for setting those expectations varies from one sport to the next and it's kind of

216
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,320
interesting because if you look at that exponent depending on what value it takes it kind of tells

217
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,840
you how important one additional point whatever that point represents for that particular sport

218
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,280
it tells you how important that is um in that particular sport so if you're in a very high

219
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:08,040
scoring type of sport like basketball um one additional point um will generally mean less than

220
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:14,280
an additional run in baseball for example so back to tennis in tennis it's kind of interesting

221
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:21,400
because it's a higher article type of game right there's you have points within games and games

222
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:27,640
within sets and you don't necessarily have to win every point to win the match in fact there's a

223
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,880
special name for matches where the winner actually won a lower percentage of points are called kind

224
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:40,840
of like the lottery matches because it's just um seems a little bit like they kind of kind of

225
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:48,040
involved yeah a bit um a bit of chance or or luck on that it's rare it happens maybe five

226
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:53,480
percent of the time but still it points out the fact that the nature of points in tennis

227
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,520
are a different thing than in a lot of other sports where you're basically there's an incentive

228
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:06,440
to win every single point um so it kind of makes you think well maybe this would be one of the sports

229
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,280
where this just this expectation this theorem breaks down um but it turns out that if you focus

230
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:21,640
on break points now these are situations where a receiver um has an opportunity to win a game

231
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:29,560
and that's a special situation in tennis because there is a strong serve advantage just the nature

232
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,400
of the serve usually gives the player that serving an edge for winning those points and so more

233
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:42,120
often than not players win their service games when they're serving um and anytime that doesn't

234
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:48,600
happen it's a real opportunity for the other player to take an advantage a position of advantage

235
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:55,320
and in fact most matches are one based off of uh breaks of serve um the only instance where that

236
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:01,960
isn't the case is when um uh set has to go to a tie break um but by and large matches are

237
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:07,960
decided on the basis of the small subset of these break point opportunities and if you focus on that

238
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,080
and that basically becomes your let's say break point uh break points one becomes your points

239
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:19,160
under this Pythagorean model that that you can find a strong relationship between that and a player's

240
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:27,720
overall uh match win expectations over the uh over a period of time and not only that but it turns

241
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,720
out the exponent is very similar to the one found in baseball um which kind of makes sense because

242
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,920
if you look at the number of break points that are typically involving particular match it's kind

243
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:46,920
of a similar scale or range as runs in baseball okay so yeah interesting interesting and the

244
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:55,560
method for demonstrating this is this um you know is it like uh coming up with the theory and then

245
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:03,480
backtesting it to a bunch of data or how did you arrive at at the the notion of using the break point

246
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:10,360
well it's interesting you can actually represent that Pythagorean relationship even with a general

247
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:17,560
form with let's say um the exponent being an unknown parameter you can express that and as a

248
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:25,160
linear model so it actually has um a form you can then investigate the simplest form where you're

249
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:32,280
just looking at let's say one uh run type or point type and and then the goal is just trying to

250
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:39,320
find what is the best um exponent that can all be done within a linear regression framework so

251
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:48,280
very kind of simple just to do um a basic um application of the model um the the thing that's

252
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,440
more of a question is what time periods are you looking at and like what is the period over which

253
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:58,760
you're forecasting and that's really you want to maybe consider how it might be used so

254
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:06,520
in tennis um you might expect that maybe after a few months into a season there being interesting

255
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:12,120
projecting where that player's likely to be the end of the season um and so on obviously if you're

256
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,960
a month out from you know your your your last few events of the season it doing that kind of

257
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:24,440
projection might be less relevant so so we looked at sort of six month projecting six months out

258
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:31,240
you know 12 months out um and set up the training data for for that purpose um but that's

259
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:37,400
you know that's all almost like tuning parameters in terms of how you're going going around to evaluate

260
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:45,080
the approach um but that that basic form um fits within you know our kind of basic regression

261
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:50,280
framework so what are some other ways that you've applied machine learning to this type of work?

262
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:57,880
well a few interesting things that were we're working on now one was actually started as um a

263
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,640
hackathon during this year as a starting open which was nice because it was sort of in parallel

264
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,880
we had um you know our one of the majors um underway the first major of the year and then we had

265
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:17,880
this big data science competition so um it's awesome yeah so that um at the end we enter that

266
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:25,560
having um thousands of data scientists participated and the goal of the the project was to use the

267
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:33,720
tracking data we were talking about to um classify the ending shot so in tennis there's a lot of

268
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:41,320
interest about how the how a point ends in terms of um was it a winner uh unforced error or forced

269
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:47,640
error so those are kind of the three mutually exclusive categories that any shot um that ends

270
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:56,520
a point can fall into and ebma is but today that labeling it's done at professional events but

271
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,160
it's still done by a human that's sitting on court and actually entering those labels with every

272
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:09,000
point and um as you can imagine i mean that's it's labor intensive and probably not um the best job

273
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:14,360
although if you're a tennis fan i guess you wouldn't mind getting this it down there um but one

274
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:20,280
issue is actually consistency with those labels so if you look at some of the unforced

275
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:26,760
error winner stats from event to event they can look quite different and there was actually

276
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:33,720
a notice at a recent Davis Cup event um sort of the form tennis forms went a little bit crazy

277
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:40,280
because there were clearly some problems and how um those stats were being tallied so you'd like

278
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:46,760
to be able to you know have a more efficient approach and also um one that's more reliable from

279
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:52,040
event to event so we were thinking well we've got this tracking data here and it tells you

280
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:58,440
about the nature of shots in such detail like maybe you could build a classifier to automate that

281
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:04,600
labeling process and that was really the the goal of the hackathon was almost kind of a proof of

282
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:10,920
the concept of like if you just had a lot of data science talent look at that problem over a few

283
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:19,880
weeks period you know how far could could they take it and um the the prize winning model actually

284
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:29,560
was able to get 95% accuracy in the the um out of sample testing um so that was that was much more

285
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:36,680
than than we hoped um and quite quite promising I think for taking that even further with with

286
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:42,120
more data that we collect over time and um building something that we might actually start using

287
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:49,800
in events um and I think not only for that particular use is it something that we're interested

288
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:56,040
in but I think it's a type of model that we could also use to maybe develop other metrics because

289
00:30:56,040 --> 00:31:01,960
if you think about it being able to say how likely is a shot a winner versus an error you can almost

290
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,400
treat that as a measure of the shots difficulty or quality and you could apply that to any shot

291
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:15,160
happening um in a match and um and so that could be a really interesting sort of extension or

292
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:20,520
or additional product that could come out of that kind of modeling work so that that was one that

293
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:25,880
um it's kind of a recent development for the group now that's that's really interesting uh can I

294
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:32,040
interrupt you and ask how does that 95% compared to what the uh humans that are sitting sitting on

295
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:38,040
the line recording that data tend to run well that's an interesting question because there's no gold

296
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:43,560
standard and that's one of the things that is an issue around you know the consistency

297
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:50,840
because you only have one person at any particular time that's actually doing this in practice um so

298
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:58,120
I don't think we really know um if there is an error in some sense in how it's being classified

299
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:03,320
it's difficult to say because it's there's some subjectivity particularly around the distinction

300
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:09,160
between a force and an unforced error and in fact for that reason you know some some tennis

301
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,800
statisticians just don't really like the system at all because there is this element of subjectivity

302
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:22,360
because it's like how far do you take it you know um is it a a shot that would be unreturnable

303
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:29,640
for the average player or do you try to make it specific to that player so that means what

304
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,560
is an unforced error for the hundredth ranked player in the world isn't the same as for Roger

305
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:42,920
Federer for example um yeah so there's there's this kind of gray area and how these things are

306
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:49,400
defined so um yeah so we don't really know I think the advantage would be that with having a

307
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:55,560
system like this you at least would know that the machine is always going to follow the same rules

308
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:01,640
and that's something that you can't be guaranteed of with with using a human classification

309
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:07,160
particularly when it's only based on one one person's opinion at any individual match do you

310
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:13,800
happen to recall any of the details around the winning model and you know it's model type and uh

311
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:20,920
general structure yeah so the the winning model um the first thing and and this was true actually

312
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:27,240
what we did was we took the top five based on their um out of sample testing performance and we

313
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:32,920
asked them all to provide some documentation about their approach and there were some characteristics

314
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:40,120
that were true across all of the all of the top five and that included um combining the men's and

315
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:49,000
women's data um in one model and um they all did extensive feature engineering and so

316
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,280
sure the practitioners out there know like how important that can be to improving performance

317
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:02,600
and and this whole experience really gave me an appreciation for that um and I would say probably

318
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:09,240
the that was the thing that separated the ultimate top prize winner from the others was the extent

319
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,320
of the feature engineering some of which include basically just trying all kind of possibilities

320
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:19,480
of combinations among um among the features that were provided but but also giving some thought

321
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:24,120
to things that would potentially be be relevant so like there were some distances that were

322
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:30,280
calculated from you know player to player and and things like this so it was kind of a combination

323
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:38,120
both of sort of um I guess substantively driven uh feature development and then others that were

324
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:44,200
just more kind of just expanding the future space and other than that I think a lot of the the

325
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:50,840
top models considered considered boosting types of approaches and those seem to work um particularly

326
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:56,600
well just on the basis of how much they were represented among that that group of models and a lot

327
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:05,080
of ensembles in that group of models or no that I think one of the five um did did a more formal

328
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:11,640
ensemble in the sense that they use multiple ML classifiers and then effectively took a sort of

329
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:18,280
an average among them um so there there was one but that wasn't actually the top winning the top

330
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:27,080
winning was um just a pure extreme um boosting approach and do you recall if any were there any

331
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,600
deep learning based uh submissions that tried to forego the feature engineering and just

332
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:38,360
toss a ton of data to a neural network there were definitely neural networks I don't I don't

333
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:44,360
think anything would meet like a definition of sort of a deep architecture um which may be

334
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:50,120
reasonable in the setting because what we provided were sort of summary features about the last two

335
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:58,040
shots of any individual point um it wasn't like we just gave them you know coordinates in space um so

336
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:05,320
the data was already fairly handcrafted you could say um um so it wasn't a situation like deep learning

337
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:12,600
generally been been most successful when applied to image data um and that data you know is much

338
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:19,080
more complex than what we were providing based off this these kind of summary measures from the

339
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:26,360
tracking data uh and then on the also on the machine learning front you've been doing some work

340
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:34,520
on emotion tracking yes so this is this is more of like our image um application so a lot of the

341
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:41,720
things that we've been discussing have been um focusing on the these tracking data but at the same

342
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:49,720
time that that's been a very great innovation in the sport we also recognize that we have all of

343
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,480
this match video just sitting around and we're not really doing anything with it from like a

344
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,800
statistical point of view or from a data capture point of view so we've been thinking about well

345
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,800
what are things that we're not able to get from the tracking data that we would want to have to try

346
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:14,760
to understand the sport better and one of those things is player um emotion and just mentality

347
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:21,080
in general so in tennis you know there's a lot of conventional wisdom about the importance of a

348
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:29,160
player's um temperament and and mentality during matches and how they perform but we don't really

349
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:36,680
have any quantifiable data around those concepts um so it's in some way it's kind of the most elusive

350
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:42,360
area in tennis performance is really understanding the link between performance and and player

351
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:52,200
emotion um so we've been working on an approach to try to capture um information about the emotions

352
00:37:52,200 --> 00:38:00,440
expressed during matches using just a single camera video and we actually um have a paper

353
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:07,240
describing our initial approach that appeared at the MIT Sloan conference this year and uh essentially

354
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:13,560
we have like seven different emotion types that we um think are relevant are particularly relevant

355
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:19,480
to a sports context um and this is one of the reasons why the problems of it challenging there's

356
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:26,120
been a lot of work with facial recognition and expression capture that's that's been um going on

357
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:34,200
and you can even see you know applications of it in in your social media devices but in in sport

358
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:41,240
you kind of want to tailor the emotions that you look at because there are some things that are

359
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:47,080
of more interest in a sports context like how concentrated a player seems to be do they seem

360
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:53,720
frustrated or nervous these kinds of things um so a lot of our work is actually just constructing

361
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:59,640
this kind of label data set so we've been treating it like a supervised a learning problem

362
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:07,080
and so a large part of of the time that we spend is to construct that that database but we have

363
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:13,400
a an initial version and then we've started to actually apply it and understand understand what

364
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:21,000
it might suggest about how players react to points and and how their reactions might affect

365
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,360
their future performance and um you know the next kind of frontier for that would be to actually

366
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:33,480
try to start doing it in real time but that involves a whole nother slew of problems so you have

367
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:40,280
to be able to in real time um identify player faces from other faces that you might see captured

368
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:47,640
in the video on broadcast to be able to label the right player to that face and then actually do

369
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:53,400
any of the prediction on a real time sort of time scale so those are some of the challenges that

370
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,440
we're looking at right now oh sounds like really interesting work it sounds like you're in the

371
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,720
early stages and and starting to build out this data set have you gotten to the point where you've

372
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:09,240
started building models on top of it and trying to relate that to player performance or are you

373
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:16,440
still way before that point well we have an initial set of approaches so we looked at a range of

374
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,400
different um you know fairly standard types of machine learning models so we had tree-based

375
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:32,120
approaches um support factor machines neural nets and from that we were able to um find what

376
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:38,200
in our initial trainings that was um sort of the best performing approach for each emotion type

377
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:46,600
of interest and then we applied that to um a group of players that we kind of know what their

378
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:53,880
baseline should be just based on sort of popular opinion and that was the big four so the big four

379
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:00,440
are Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Rafael Nadal, four of the most successful male

380
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:09,160
tennis players in recent times in fact like from 2006 to the present they've won 45 of 49

381
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,840
grand slams those are the biggest tennis events in the year so so they're they're players that

382
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:21,640
are quite well known in the sport and so they kind of each have a personality profile and uh

383
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:29,160
we applied the emotion capture to establish sort of baselines for each of them and it was almost

384
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:35,480
way checking the face validity of what we were doing because it's like even if our model is able to

385
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:42,280
get a good level of accuracy against the training sets labels for each of these emotions how do we know

386
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:47,400
that they actually represent anything meaningful so that was why we wanted to kind of look at a

387
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,560
group of players where we kind of some idea of how they differ in terms of their their typical

388
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:56,040
temperament um and actually they actually held up quite well because for example it showed that

389
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:02,840
the predominant emotion for Nadal was anxiety and that was one that you know was was an expectation

390
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:09,160
for him compared to the other the other three players um whereas Roger Federer was the least

391
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:14,200
expressive of the group he was if anything he was more focused at any particular point in time

392
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:21,400
than any of the other emotions so that that was a promising result and then we started to look at

393
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:27,160
for that group what the relationship was with uh performance and we did find that there were

394
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:34,600
there were strong associations with the number of the emotions that were captured and how that

395
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:41,640
player was performing in in the matches that were we evaluated which does suggest that there

396
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,360
is some link there but the interesting thing is that it was quite variable like the nature of those

397
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:53,320
associations uh from one player to the next so what that it's still early days

398
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:59,400
incoming any very strong conclusions but I think right now we can say that um there

399
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,200
if there is a link it's probably one that's player specific the nature of how emotions

400
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:13,640
influence the player's performance yeah I would think that if the you know you've got four

401
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:21,880
very winning players that all have different baseline temperaments then the uh it would be the

402
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,440
difference between their baseline and what they're observed at in any particular point of time

403
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:33,640
that would be kind of a ventrist um as opposed to you know the frustrated player never wins or

404
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:38,600
something like that if there's a really good frustrated player yeah that's definitely one of the

405
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:45,480
things that were interested in in um evaluating more broadly as we collect more amorphous

406
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:53,720
emotion data um is is it you know just the absolute intensity of any particular emotion or is it

407
00:43:53,720 --> 00:44:00,600
you know how um how much it represents a change um from what's normal for a particular

408
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:06,360
player that that actually matters um and if you just look at you know the top of the game

409
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:11,640
um and it's been true historically like you go back to board macro and you couldn't find like

410
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:16,200
two more opposite personalities but in terms of their success you know they were quite quite

411
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:22,600
comparable and and that's that's true as well today you can have players that express a lot of

412
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:29,640
anger and intensity like an Andy Murray you know against um a sort of stoic champion like

413
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:36,520
Federer and so that in itself tells you that it's probably not that there's any like universal mentality

414
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:42,600
that's like the one formula for being um you know one of the all-time best players in the sport

415
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:49,560
but it may have more to do with these kind of deviations from whatever a player's kind of norm is

416
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:55,000
right right wow super super interesting work thank you so much for taking the time out to share

417
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,960
it with us yeah thank you for the opportunity Sam this is fun is there anything else that you'd

418
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:06,360
like to know for the audience or anything that you'd like to point them to um I guess just to say

419
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:11,800
I mean it for the maybe aspiring sport statisticians think there's definitely a lot of opportunity

420
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,320
these days I know our own groups been been growing even over the past six months and and I think

421
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:25,240
there's more and more appreciation for how data science expertise can help to advance sport in

422
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:30,200
all areas I didn't even mention but I mean there's more more work being done on the business side

423
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:35,640
for example and understanding you know consumer behavior it's bored and ticketing and things

424
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:42,840
like that so so there's definitely more and more opportunity um for a statisticians data scientists

425
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:47,400
that are interested in careers in sport and so I would definitely encourage you all to pursue it

426
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:56,920
if that's a passion of yours fantastic well thanks so much Stephanie thank you all right everyone
