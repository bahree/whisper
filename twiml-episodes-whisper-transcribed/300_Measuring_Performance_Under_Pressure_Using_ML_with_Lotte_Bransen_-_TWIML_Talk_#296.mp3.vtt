01:33.520 --> 01:40.200
All right everyone, I am on the line with Lata Branson, Lata is a scientific researcher

01:40.200 --> 01:44.520
at Sci Sports, Lata welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

01:44.520 --> 01:49.880
Well, thank you, I'm happy to be here. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to chatting

01:49.880 --> 01:51.120
with you.

01:51.120 --> 01:58.000
You are in the enviable position of having combined a couple of your life's passions.

01:58.000 --> 02:03.560
You've been playing soccer since the age of five and now you get to study it and apply

02:03.560 --> 02:12.000
machine learning to the analysis of that sport and others as well, or are you primarily

02:12.000 --> 02:13.840
focused on soccer right now?

02:13.840 --> 02:15.600
I'm just focused on soccer right now.

02:15.600 --> 02:16.600
Yeah.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.600
So how did this all come to be?

02:18.600 --> 02:25.440
Well, as you already mentioned, I played soccer my whole my life and I did a bachelor's

02:25.440 --> 02:30.520
in mathematics and while I was studying, I found out of this company called Sci Sports

02:30.520 --> 02:38.360
that was using, was combining mathematics and soccer to get insights in what players

02:38.360 --> 02:39.360
clubs should buy.

02:39.360 --> 02:45.480
So then I contacted the company and the company back then was just run by three students

02:45.480 --> 02:52.000
and just the beginning of the company, around five years ago and I kept in contact.

02:52.000 --> 02:57.640
I worked there like one day a week and then I started doing my master's in econometrics

02:57.640 --> 03:03.040
and at the end of my master's I could work at the company as a scientific researcher.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.000
So that's how it all started.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.720
And the company's based in Amsterdam?

03:07.720 --> 03:12.200
It's based in, oh, it started and it's today, it's like in the east of the country.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.200
Okay.

03:13.200 --> 03:17.160
It's a very small country so that's around two hours from Amsterdam.

03:17.160 --> 03:18.160
Okay.

03:18.160 --> 03:23.440
And we also have an office in Amesford right now that is like in the middle of Netherlands.

03:23.440 --> 03:27.160
And from the time you started working there when it was just that three students, it's

03:27.160 --> 03:29.240
grown to what now?

03:29.240 --> 03:31.520
To around 50 people right now.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.960
So just six years, big growth.

03:34.960 --> 03:41.200
Talk a little bit about before we dive into the specific paper that we'll be speaking

03:41.200 --> 03:42.520
about.

03:42.520 --> 03:47.160
Talk a little bit about kind of your general area of research there.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.160
Yeah.

03:48.160 --> 03:49.800
So we are at Seismort.

03:49.800 --> 03:55.920
We help multiple different clients but our main focus is on the recruitment part for

03:55.920 --> 03:56.920
Clubs.

03:56.920 --> 04:03.960
So actually, Clubs want to find new players for their teams and that's where we help.

04:03.960 --> 04:09.960
And in our team, our data analytics team, we built our new models, mainly using machine

04:09.960 --> 04:14.840
learning to get insights from this data that we get.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.600
And that's how we, what we hope to Clubs.

04:16.600 --> 04:23.960
And we have like an online platform where while our clients can find around $19,000,

04:23.960 --> 04:29.560
$90,000 players from all over the world and can find their strengths and weaknesses.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.960
And well, that's how that helped them.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.960
Okay.

04:33.960 --> 04:39.320
What are some of the main data sources that you have access to for the various analytics

04:39.320 --> 04:40.320
that you do?

04:40.320 --> 04:41.320
Yeah.

04:41.320 --> 04:44.960
We got access to match event data as it is called.

04:44.960 --> 04:47.680
We get us from our partner, Wisecout.

04:47.680 --> 04:53.640
And this data that is like many of the annotated, like for every action that occurs on the pitch.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.840
So in the past, it rippled across.

04:56.840 --> 05:02.520
So annotated, which player performs this action from where to where, or what time in the match.

05:02.520 --> 05:06.440
And that's the kind of data that we deal with daily.

05:06.440 --> 05:16.200
Okay. And so the data is kind of a set of time series events or, yeah, it is, yeah.

05:16.200 --> 05:22.200
Okay. And are there other data source providers that are doing things with more imagery or

05:22.200 --> 05:27.800
video-based data, or is that not prevalent in soccer yet?

05:27.800 --> 05:28.800
It is.

05:28.800 --> 05:32.040
We have a part of our company is working on that.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.560
We have a special team called the Bo James team.

05:34.560 --> 05:40.680
And they are working on the scammer system, which currently hangs in three stadiums.

05:40.680 --> 05:46.800
And that is like using this computer vision to attract the players and the ball at each

05:46.800 --> 05:49.400
moment, each time in the game.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.680
So that's also what we're doing.

05:50.680 --> 05:55.480
So we're also collecting data with my team is primarily focused on event data for the

05:55.480 --> 06:01.080
clubs, because, well, two scout players, you have to know a lot about all these players

06:01.080 --> 06:02.080
around the world.

06:02.080 --> 06:06.800
And this video data is not yet provided for a lot of leaks.

06:06.800 --> 06:10.360
So that's why makes sense, makes sense.

06:10.360 --> 06:16.320
So the paper that we are going to dig into is one that you presented earlier this year

06:16.320 --> 06:23.240
at the Sloan Sports Analytics conference is called choke or shine, quantifying soccer

06:23.240 --> 06:26.280
players' ability to perform under mental pressure.

06:26.280 --> 06:30.800
Tell us a little bit about the motivations for this paper.

06:30.800 --> 06:36.640
Yeah, so, well, it's about quantifying what it says, the stroke and place abilities to

06:36.640 --> 06:38.720
perform under mental pressure.

06:38.720 --> 06:43.160
And what we actually want to do is, well, we saw there's a lot of research in stroke

06:43.160 --> 06:48.600
or analytics, current leads, it's growing fastly, but there's never any research quantitatively

06:48.600 --> 06:53.080
done about how players perform under mental pressure.

06:53.080 --> 06:58.920
And I've also, as a soccer player myself, I also feel this pressure sometimes, so it's

06:58.920 --> 07:03.040
actually how we came well with this topic.

07:03.040 --> 07:07.440
Yeah, so we wanted to measure the performance of these players when the pressure is getting

07:07.440 --> 07:08.440
high.

07:08.440 --> 07:13.120
So we had to access to the data for this, and that's actually how we start this research

07:13.120 --> 07:20.800
and we did a collaboration with two people from the KL over, Peter and Jesse, and another

07:20.800 --> 07:24.720
colleague of mine, Jan, we did this research.

07:24.720 --> 07:30.440
And is applying some kind of machine learning or analytics to mental pressure?

07:30.440 --> 07:33.800
Is that something that you've seen done in other fields?

07:33.800 --> 07:36.880
Is it, you know, prevalent in some other fields?

07:36.880 --> 07:41.840
And it's something you're trying to bring to soccer or is it something that we don't

07:41.840 --> 07:45.200
really do a lot of now in sports?

07:45.200 --> 07:49.720
It has been investigated in some other sports, but not extensively yet.

07:49.720 --> 07:53.840
So I think it's still a field that needs to be investigated more.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.080
We also want to do more in a research of this.

07:57.080 --> 08:01.120
And we've spoken to quite some mental coaches that work at different clubs, and they always

08:01.120 --> 08:06.200
tell us that they have like, it's hard for them to show like the improvement of certain

08:06.200 --> 08:11.080
players on certain aspects of the mental game.

08:11.080 --> 08:17.400
And I think, well, in soccer, it's well in all sports, it's very important that the

08:17.400 --> 08:20.000
mentality is correct.

08:20.000 --> 08:25.920
So you can perform on a mental pressure because that's when the points are being made.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.720
So yeah, yeah.

08:27.720 --> 08:34.080
And so how are you in your research defining mental pressure and how are you characterizing

08:34.080 --> 08:36.320
it in the games that you're looking at?

08:36.320 --> 08:37.320
Yeah.

08:37.320 --> 08:41.040
So actually what we did, we defined two aspects of mental pressure.

08:41.040 --> 08:44.960
So the pre-game pressure and the in-game pressure.

08:44.960 --> 08:49.600
So you can imagine that before a game starts, there's already some pressure on certain games.

08:49.600 --> 08:55.840
For example, when you're playing a game for a championship, like in the primary leagues,

08:55.840 --> 09:00.600
like I think it was 10 years ago, something like that, maybe less.

09:00.600 --> 09:07.000
When a city and United, Manchester City United, both could be the champions, well, then

09:07.000 --> 09:09.760
the pressure is getting high.

09:09.760 --> 09:15.240
And we also investigated in-game mental pressure, and that's based on an in-game win probability

09:15.240 --> 09:16.240
model.

09:16.240 --> 09:22.960
So at each point in time, we predict, well, the win probability for both of the teams.

09:22.960 --> 09:29.680
And when a goal has been scored, when this in-game win probability will change a lot,

09:29.680 --> 09:32.000
then we say like the pressure is high.

09:32.000 --> 09:36.680
So for example, when it's like a one-one in the last minutes, then pressure is really

09:36.680 --> 09:42.840
high because when you score a goal, so mainly change the winner of the game, then there's

09:42.840 --> 09:47.840
already a three-zero score on the board, then it doesn't matter anymore.

09:47.840 --> 09:56.920
And so you've kind of characterized games by this low pressure, high pressure, or at least

09:56.920 --> 10:03.440
the pre-game is the pressure is at the level of the game.

10:03.440 --> 10:09.240
But the in-game, that's an attribute you're applying to the games, is it minute by minute

10:09.240 --> 10:13.240
or event by event, or I guess it's just whenever the score changes?

10:13.240 --> 10:18.800
Yeah, so that's actually whenever it's actually minute by minute.

10:18.800 --> 10:24.520
So it's, yeah, so when the score changes, it will immediately affect this model.

10:24.520 --> 10:30.600
And it takes into account the current score also like whether our red cards, yellow cards,

10:30.600 --> 10:31.800
and the kind of stuff.

10:31.800 --> 10:38.880
And also when a team is attacking a lot, they also account for that in the in-game win-pobility

10:38.880 --> 10:39.880
model.

10:39.880 --> 10:41.040
So yeah, that's it.

10:41.040 --> 10:48.760
And like for the pre-game model, it's like a fixed set number per game, yeah.

10:48.760 --> 10:53.600
And those two combined make like the pressure at a certain event in a game.

10:53.600 --> 10:54.920
Okay.

10:54.920 --> 11:01.760
And so you've got the pressure on the one hand and you're trying to use that to predict

11:01.760 --> 11:03.080
what?

11:03.080 --> 11:07.120
So we actually have depression on the one hand and on the other hand, we have actually

11:07.120 --> 11:10.160
three performance metrics.

11:10.160 --> 11:16.960
So for every action that we have, so this pass or a dribble, we compute three things.

11:16.960 --> 11:25.720
So the contribution of this action, so by contribution, we mean the increase in scoring

11:25.720 --> 11:27.520
a goal in the near future.

11:27.520 --> 11:32.520
So actually for every action, we put the value of the game before the action and after

11:32.520 --> 11:33.920
the action.

11:33.920 --> 11:38.360
And the difference in those two makes the contribution of an action.

11:38.360 --> 11:44.280
And next to that, we also measured the position, the quality of the decision and the quality

11:44.280 --> 11:46.000
of the execution.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.840
And those three, for those three values, we can see like how does a player perform.

11:49.840 --> 11:54.720
But when the pressure is like in a normal normal state, when it's getting high and when

11:54.720 --> 12:00.000
it's getting lower, and this is more like for descriptive analysis of all those players.

12:00.000 --> 12:07.440
This contribution element, it sounds like that saying that at a given time in the game,

12:07.440 --> 12:14.240
given all of the player positions and some event that just happened, you're able to come

12:14.240 --> 12:19.400
up with some metric that captures kind of the relative advantage of the different teams

12:19.400 --> 12:22.120
that in and of itself sounds like a hard problem.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.120
Yeah, it is.

12:23.120 --> 12:27.920
Yeah, so we, that was actually how this all started.

12:27.920 --> 12:34.360
So I think a year before this paper, we worked on a model to measure these contributions

12:34.360 --> 12:37.400
for other players.

12:37.400 --> 12:43.720
So what this actually does is for each game state, that's how we call it.

12:43.720 --> 12:50.120
So every game state is like characterized by all the actions that have been played until

12:50.120 --> 12:57.840
then the position of the player with the ball, the time in the match, the score difference.

12:57.840 --> 13:04.520
And for every game state, we predict the chance that within 10 actions goals being scored

13:04.520 --> 13:06.000
by the one team.

13:06.000 --> 13:09.800
So it's actually like a binary classification problem.

13:09.800 --> 13:13.600
And we also, on the other hand, we also predict the chance that the other team will score

13:13.600 --> 13:14.600
within 10 actions.

13:14.600 --> 13:19.360
And in this way, we can measure like for every action, we can measure the offensive and

13:19.360 --> 13:22.120
the other hand, the defensive contribution.

13:22.120 --> 13:27.600
So for example, when a player passes the ball from his own half to his striker, this will

13:27.600 --> 13:32.200
have like a very high contribution, a offensive contribution, without an other end, if you

13:32.200 --> 13:37.440
interceptable in your own box, you will also have a high defensive contribution.

13:37.440 --> 13:40.160
And that's what we, well, we were first worked on.

13:40.160 --> 13:45.920
And this is also something that we already showed to our clients and they can find like

13:45.920 --> 13:51.040
players that have like, for example, high ball's contribution, they can easily spot

13:51.040 --> 13:54.280
talents before other others do.

13:54.280 --> 14:00.640
With that original work on contribution, okay, there's a couple of questions there.

14:00.640 --> 14:07.920
One, when you're looking at player position, like do you quantize that in some way or is

14:07.920 --> 14:11.160
it kind of continuous position in the field?

14:11.160 --> 14:15.840
Do you mean like with position, I mean, where, where the player is with the ball?

14:15.840 --> 14:16.840
Okay.

14:16.840 --> 14:20.160
Or do you even look at where the players are that don't have the ball?

14:20.160 --> 14:21.840
Yeah, that's, that's a good point.

14:21.840 --> 14:26.200
That's one of the, well, disadvantages of the event data.

14:26.200 --> 14:31.280
So with this event data, we only have all the actions that happen with the ball.

14:31.280 --> 14:36.760
So we have to pass the dribbles, but we don't know where all the other, well, 21 players

14:36.760 --> 14:37.760
are.

14:37.760 --> 14:38.760
Yeah.

14:38.760 --> 14:39.760
So that's, well, that is.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.400
Did you call that an advantage or a disadvantage?

14:42.400 --> 14:43.400
Disadvantage.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.640
Because it makes you problem easier.

14:46.640 --> 14:52.640
Well, no, no, we, I would really love to have this, this data as well.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.640
Yeah.

14:53.640 --> 14:55.920
We currently don't have that.

14:55.920 --> 15:00.280
But we also captured, well, we tried to capture this with, by adding information about

15:00.280 --> 15:01.280
the attack.

15:01.280 --> 15:05.080
So we, we add information about speed of the game.

15:05.080 --> 15:10.400
So, so in, in the soccer, you have quite a lot of counter attacks.

15:10.400 --> 15:14.800
So you know, like when the game moved fast or the ball moved fast to the other half, then

15:14.800 --> 15:19.800
we know, like, this is a different situation than when the ball was, when it was a very

15:19.800 --> 15:20.800
slow attack.

15:20.800 --> 15:24.800
So that's the kind of things that we try to, to account for.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.600
But yeah, we don't have these always locations now.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.600
Yeah.

15:28.600 --> 15:29.600
Yeah.

15:29.600 --> 15:33.800
It does seem like there is potentially an interesting element of player contribution that

15:33.800 --> 15:38.480
is, you know, being in the right place at the right time that can't be captured in your

15:38.480 --> 15:39.480
car model.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.480
That's true.

15:40.480 --> 15:43.800
But we're also looking at where a player receives the ball.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.800
And that also already tells a lot about his positioning.

15:46.800 --> 15:47.800
Okay.

15:47.800 --> 15:48.640
But it was, yeah.

15:48.640 --> 15:53.760
So if you, you often receive the ball in the, in the opponent's box, that says a lot

15:53.760 --> 15:56.400
about his positioning that we've seen.

15:56.400 --> 16:03.720
And so back to that positioning question, are you, like, do you kind of split the field

16:03.720 --> 16:09.520
up into zones or, you know, meter by meter squares or something like that?

16:09.520 --> 16:12.040
Are you using kind of absolute positioning?

16:12.040 --> 16:13.040
Yeah.

16:13.040 --> 16:20.920
We, we get it, like, in meter by meter, that's actually also what we use in the, so actually

16:20.920 --> 16:26.760
you have the, it's annotated as like 100, 100 pitch.

16:26.760 --> 16:33.240
And then we normalize it to like the, the normal pitch sizes in Europe or in, like, I

16:33.240 --> 16:35.960
think, over, over all the world.

16:35.960 --> 16:38.520
So that's how you, so it's a kind of meter by meter, yeah.

16:38.520 --> 16:39.520
All right.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.040
So you've got this contribution data.

16:42.040 --> 16:50.280
And that becomes the, that's another one of the inputs to your, your choke or shine model.

16:50.280 --> 16:55.000
Actually, is it the, is it the contribution that's trying to predict whether a point will

16:55.000 --> 16:59.520
be scored in 10 actions or is that the, yeah, yeah, that's a contribution.

16:59.520 --> 17:05.080
So actually that's the contribution is the difference in scoring a goal before your action

17:05.080 --> 17:06.080
and after your action.

17:06.080 --> 17:07.080
Ah, got it.

17:07.080 --> 17:11.880
So if, so for example, if you have a bit on your own, the chance of scoring a goal within

17:11.880 --> 17:14.480
10, 10 actions will be very low.

17:14.480 --> 17:19.360
And then if it after the action is very, is higher than it's the difference between those.

17:19.360 --> 17:23.200
And if you lose the ball, you get negative contribution ratings.

17:23.200 --> 17:32.280
And so then you're taking this and as an input, and then using this to, I'm trying to get

17:32.280 --> 17:36.320
back to the choke or shine model.

17:36.320 --> 17:40.880
How does the contribution play into the mental pressure model?

17:40.880 --> 17:47.600
So what we actually do is we investigate the moments in which the, well, actually we

17:47.600 --> 17:51.360
investigate how what a normal contribution is for a certain player.

17:51.360 --> 17:55.160
So in that way, we can, can identify the tenants, for example.

17:55.160 --> 18:03.560
So we did this for the MLS, for example, we saw that, let's me see the names, a font

18:03.560 --> 18:11.600
of Davies and Barco and Adams started Adams were in like in the 2018 season, when I like

18:11.600 --> 18:16.080
to play with the highest contribution ratings in, in the MLS.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.840
So what we actually do, we have this contribution ratings per action.

18:19.840 --> 18:24.200
And if we then sum up all these ratings for a certain player, and then we normalize

18:24.200 --> 18:29.680
this per, per 90 minutes of play, then we can actually say like what is this average

18:29.680 --> 18:32.720
contribution for, for a game.

18:32.720 --> 18:37.280
And then when we looked at, for example, a font of Davies, when the pressure was normal,

18:37.280 --> 18:41.160
he belongs to the best players in the, in the league, but actually when the pressure is

18:41.160 --> 18:45.600
getting high, he belongs to like more like an average player, even below average.

18:45.600 --> 18:46.600
Okay.

18:46.600 --> 18:51.760
So that was the kind of the insight that we were looking for, to see like how the players

18:51.760 --> 18:58.600
perform, when this pressure is normal or high or low, so actually we've been the pressure

18:58.600 --> 19:04.560
levels that we had in like three bins, and that's how we identified this.

19:04.560 --> 19:08.760
And because we saw like, okay, we see this contribution is changing, but we also wanted

19:08.760 --> 19:11.800
to know like, why is this changing?

19:11.800 --> 19:16.080
And then we came up with the idea like, okay, the contribution rating of a player, it depends

19:16.080 --> 19:17.480
actually on two things.

19:17.480 --> 19:21.880
So contribution of an action depends actually on the choice that you made, and also on

19:21.880 --> 19:23.400
how you execute this action.

19:23.400 --> 19:28.560
So the choice can be to, to play the ball to your striker as a defender, but if you don't

19:28.560 --> 19:31.080
execute it well, you will never get a high contribution.

19:31.080 --> 19:36.840
And on the hand, if you make a wrong choice, but you execute the action in a good way,

19:36.840 --> 19:39.640
then it's also will not give you a high contribution rating.

19:39.640 --> 19:41.640
So that's what we're kind of looking for.

19:41.640 --> 19:48.560
So to see why these ratings are changing for certain players.

19:48.560 --> 19:53.200
So that's actually what we did, and we also looked into more like tactical analysis.

19:53.200 --> 20:00.960
So for example, Manchester United, they tend to dribble less, dribble more when the pressure

20:00.960 --> 20:04.080
is getting high, but actually their contribution from the dribbles is decreasing.

20:04.080 --> 20:08.720
So they're choosing to dribble, then it's not a good decision to do that.

20:08.720 --> 20:12.120
So that's kind of the insight that we were looking at.

20:12.120 --> 20:21.800
And so were you able to arrive at the decision-making and execution as were these outputs of this

20:21.800 --> 20:24.160
model or were these inputs to the model?

20:24.160 --> 20:27.280
It was like inputs to the complete model, yeah.

20:27.280 --> 20:30.360
So these are also based on the data that we got here.

20:30.360 --> 20:37.240
So you have this data that's telling you if a pass is made and then is execution just

20:37.240 --> 20:40.440
telling you if the pass was completed or if it was not completed.

20:40.440 --> 20:47.040
And so does it, it doesn't really take into account defense contribution at all.

20:47.040 --> 20:52.720
No, this is focused on the difficulty of the action.

20:52.720 --> 20:58.720
So if you pause a long board and you manage to succeed, you will get a higher execution

20:58.720 --> 20:59.720
rating.

20:59.720 --> 21:06.800
But also like a tech also, tech also defensive action, it can also be unsuccessful or

21:06.800 --> 21:10.280
you can also make a file in your own box.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.600
So it also does take into account defensive actions.

21:12.600 --> 21:19.440
But while we know that using event data, it's very hard to rate players on the defensive

21:19.440 --> 21:25.320
actions, because while more things happen with the ball in offense, so that's that hard.

21:25.320 --> 21:29.200
Yeah, that's one of the legs of the data.

21:29.200 --> 21:37.680
And is the data, is there, is it labeled or rated in terms of the intended target for

21:37.680 --> 21:43.720
a pass or is it just that a pass happened and the next event is whether the, you know,

21:43.720 --> 21:48.560
the pass was received or if someone intercepted it.

21:48.560 --> 21:53.280
Yeah, that's actually, we know the end location of the pass or we know the direction of it.

21:53.280 --> 21:57.000
And in that way, we can kind of predict where it was going to, yeah.

21:57.000 --> 21:58.000
Okay.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.320
So we know the end location.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.320
Yeah.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.320
All right.

22:01.320 --> 22:07.120
So tell us a little bit about the process of coming up with the, this model.

22:07.120 --> 22:11.480
How did you start and what were some of the things that you tried?

22:11.480 --> 22:17.040
So well, we actually started with like having lots of discussions and while thinking of how

22:17.040 --> 22:19.480
we want to want to measure this.

22:19.480 --> 22:25.200
So well, as I said before, we work together with two people from the living university.

22:25.200 --> 22:28.680
So they visited us and coslaven is in Belgium.

22:28.680 --> 22:35.240
So they visited us at, at Amosford, at our office and we had just had like one big, just

22:35.240 --> 22:39.960
discussing, no programming, just discussing how we wanted to do this.

22:39.960 --> 22:44.200
And that's how we came up with the different models that we wanted to capture.

22:44.200 --> 22:50.400
And our main thing was you also wanted to try as much as possible and get, see how far

22:50.400 --> 22:53.120
we got in all of those aspects.

22:53.120 --> 22:59.680
And we know like some things are hard to capture with the data that we have.

22:59.680 --> 23:04.000
So we first started with how to, we already had this contribution ratings.

23:04.000 --> 23:11.160
So we tried to improve those, train it on more data, try some different models for that.

23:11.160 --> 23:17.000
And the main focus was in beginning on how to measure this, this meant pressure.

23:17.000 --> 23:25.000
So for the free game, meant pressure model, we wanted to, well, we needed some kind of

23:25.000 --> 23:27.320
ground food to train this model.

23:27.320 --> 23:32.320
So that's why we, we'll talk to some soccer experts, it's how we call them.

23:32.320 --> 23:38.720
So soccer players, trainers, coaches, scouts from clubs and we let them, well, we made

23:38.720 --> 23:45.080
like a tool where they could like rank games and we gave them information about this game.

23:45.080 --> 23:51.720
So was it in the beginning of the season, what is the ranking of the, of the league, what

23:51.720 --> 23:53.680
is the goal of the team, that kind of stuff.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.440
And then they, they could rank those, those teams.

23:56.440 --> 23:59.120
So it was like a pair of white ranking.

23:59.120 --> 24:04.640
And we use this to train, to train our pre game meant pressure model.

24:04.640 --> 24:09.200
So in this model, we make use of, well, different features.

24:09.200 --> 24:15.880
So as I said before, the ranking of the team, how long the season is already been played.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.880
So where in the season are we?

24:18.880 --> 24:20.800
And also like on what spot are they?

24:20.800 --> 24:25.760
So if they are playing for your, your opa league spots, then the pressure will be higher

24:25.760 --> 24:28.520
than when they already medicated, for example.

24:28.520 --> 24:34.200
So that's actually how we started by making this tool and collecting as much input as possible

24:34.200 --> 24:40.520
or also talking to these people to ask them what do you think is like important when

24:40.520 --> 24:42.240
you feel the pressure.

24:42.240 --> 24:47.160
It's actually how it started and then we kept on improving.

24:47.160 --> 24:57.520
And so with that, the pressure model, were you training against subjective labels of whether

24:57.520 --> 25:00.200
a game was high pressure or not?

25:00.200 --> 25:07.000
Yeah, so actually the rank labels by the experts, yeah.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.000
Okay.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.440
So that's the pressure model.

25:11.440 --> 25:14.440
And then what kind of model did you use for that?

25:14.440 --> 25:20.120
So for the pre game pressure model, we use it's gradient boosted ranking trees.

25:20.120 --> 25:27.240
And for the in game, mental pressure model, that's so for that model, we wanted to predict

25:27.240 --> 25:33.040
that every time, so every minute in the game, the sum of the goals, the number of goals

25:33.040 --> 25:34.800
that both teams would score.

25:34.800 --> 25:39.640
And then we could like predict the probabilities of win, draw and loss.

25:39.640 --> 25:47.120
And for this model, we made use of the out of the French stations, variational inference

25:47.120 --> 25:49.640
of a bi-MC tree.

25:49.640 --> 25:56.800
And we trained this on all the data that we had up until the 2017 to 2018 season.

25:56.800 --> 26:03.280
So yeah, that's actually how we trained these two models and the combination of those

26:03.280 --> 26:04.280
two pressure models.

26:04.280 --> 26:09.960
So the in game and the pre game, it makes us the pressure model.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.640
How are those combined?

26:11.640 --> 26:17.960
Yeah, so that's where we also had, well, difficulty.

26:17.960 --> 26:23.400
What difficulty is like, it's very hard to, I think in the, I think it's many areas,

26:23.400 --> 26:29.400
but in sports, it's kind of hard if you don't really have a ground truth.

26:29.400 --> 26:34.160
So in the end, we decided to multiply those two numbers.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.800
So it's the in game and the pre game.

26:36.800 --> 26:43.080
So when the pre game pressure is high, but in the game, it quickly gets to a 3.0 score,

26:43.080 --> 26:49.520
so there's not really high pressure anymore than the total pressure will be low as well.

26:49.520 --> 26:53.640
But we certainly wanted to do, want to do more investigation in this.

26:53.640 --> 26:56.720
You should just collect more information on that.

26:56.720 --> 27:02.200
You mentioned some of the kind of surprising findings from looking at some of the MLS

27:02.200 --> 27:08.160
players, were there any other kind of interesting surprises in when you started applying these

27:08.160 --> 27:09.160
results?

27:09.160 --> 27:16.680
Yeah, there were like lots of results that we, some that we already, that we also expected.

27:16.680 --> 27:21.760
For example, that Cristiano Ronaldo is like very constant in the pressure.

27:21.760 --> 27:29.040
So what is not, nothing new maybe, but that was felt good to see this, but for Neymar.

27:29.040 --> 27:37.000
So when he was still playing it by Barcelona, his performance goes down in the pressure.

27:37.000 --> 27:41.880
So then he's like more like an average player, whilst when the pressure is lower, he belongs

27:41.880 --> 27:45.000
like to the best of the league.

27:45.000 --> 27:51.360
And then what we also find really interesting is that Liverpool tends to buy players that

27:51.360 --> 27:52.760
perform well on the pressure.

27:52.760 --> 27:59.320
So there's actually just something that we found by accident, but it's interesting to

27:59.320 --> 28:00.320
see.

28:00.320 --> 28:07.200
So in their signings, from the last three seasons, were all except for Kaita, they were all

28:07.200 --> 28:11.720
like performing way better under pressure than under low pressure.

28:11.720 --> 28:14.280
So that was interesting to see.

28:14.280 --> 28:19.440
Do you think there's anything interesting in looking at kind of the overall team composition

28:19.440 --> 28:25.360
of players that perform better in low pressure versus high pressure?

28:25.360 --> 28:28.120
Are there any interesting ideas there?

28:28.120 --> 28:31.040
Yeah, so we also also looked at that.

28:31.040 --> 28:36.000
So we wanted to show as many applications as possible.

28:36.000 --> 28:42.800
So we looked at what the defenders of Reventus, for example, and we saw that there are two

28:42.800 --> 28:48.720
players, Benassia and Bulushi, who like perform way better when the pressure is high and

28:48.720 --> 28:54.080
like two others, Kilini and Rugani perform way worse under pressure.

28:54.080 --> 29:00.640
So this might help coaches to select the players to let them play in a certain match.

29:00.640 --> 29:07.360
So when you're playing like a Champions League final, you might choose Benassia over Kilini.

29:07.360 --> 29:10.960
So yeah, there's also some interesting insights in there.

29:10.960 --> 29:19.960
So this then goes a bit beyond the kind of scouting use cases that you tend to focus on

29:19.960 --> 29:25.440
and could be something that is useful for tactical planning by coaches.

29:25.440 --> 29:26.920
Yeah, definitely.

29:26.920 --> 29:33.680
Yeah, we also, well, we started focusing on the scouting, but we currently also like doing

29:33.680 --> 29:35.320
other stuff for clubs.

29:35.320 --> 29:38.440
So we helped them, for example, with the opponent analysis.

29:38.440 --> 29:42.200
So finding the weaknesses and strengths of their opponents.

29:42.200 --> 29:49.480
For example, at previous World Cup, the men's World Cup, I must say, there was, we helped

29:49.480 --> 29:57.280
the Belgium team, like analyzing their opponents, although they came until the semi-finals,

29:57.280 --> 29:59.280
so that was nice as well.

29:59.280 --> 30:03.080
So that's also where this could be very helpful, yeah.

30:03.080 --> 30:08.360
And what I said before, also for mental coaches that want to show the stuff, how their

30:08.360 --> 30:13.320
progress is with certain players is also very helpful to have something to measure this.

30:13.320 --> 30:17.040
So it could be used for many things, yeah.

30:17.040 --> 30:23.760
You certainly learned a lot about the kind of the application of some of these models

30:23.760 --> 30:30.320
to this problem, but were there any interesting kind of fundamental learnings or observations

30:30.320 --> 30:37.600
on the part of your team about applying these kinds of models to the kinds of data that

30:37.600 --> 30:38.600
you're applying it to?

30:38.600 --> 30:43.160
It was interesting to see that there are differences between certain players, but I think

30:43.160 --> 30:47.720
definitely we need to investigate more, whether we can also like make it more like a predictive

30:47.720 --> 30:51.920
thing to predict the performance of players in the future.

30:51.920 --> 30:55.200
So we're looking into that right now.

30:55.200 --> 31:00.560
But yeah, I think the main insight is that there's lots of users to be done still on this

31:00.560 --> 31:02.560
field.

31:02.560 --> 31:08.800
And that we are able to capture certain things, to capture contributions of players and

31:08.800 --> 31:13.400
in a better way than just looking at the number of goalscord, because in soccer there's

31:13.400 --> 31:17.760
like on average just two goals per game.

31:17.760 --> 31:22.280
So it definitely doesn't always say that the one team was better than the other.

31:22.280 --> 31:26.560
So yeah, we found some interesting insights in there.

31:26.560 --> 31:32.920
Where did you find the most challenges from a technical perspective?

31:32.920 --> 31:34.320
Good question.

31:34.320 --> 31:42.040
Well, it was really hard to get the in-game win probability model working well.

31:42.040 --> 31:50.600
I think also like the hard thing is to get this ground truth in soccer, that's where we

31:50.600 --> 31:51.680
have to deal with.

31:51.680 --> 31:54.320
We don't have the locations of the other players.

31:54.320 --> 31:59.040
So that was for the decision rating model very hard as well.

31:59.040 --> 32:07.920
So I think that's what from technical side was hard to get it all working in a good way.

32:07.920 --> 32:12.760
And I think also, yeah, not just from technical side, but one of the problems is I think to

32:12.760 --> 32:19.200
get this message across to people from the industry, from the soccer world.

32:19.200 --> 32:27.440
So just the applicability of machine learning and analytics in general, or the specifically

32:27.440 --> 32:30.280
around looking at mental pressure.

32:30.280 --> 32:38.600
I think in general, but especially in mental pressure, also like the mental aspect of

32:38.600 --> 32:46.600
the game, if analyzing the mental aspect is very new in most sports, and then also using

32:46.600 --> 32:53.920
data for that is like for people in the soccer industry that's maybe a bit too early right

32:53.920 --> 32:54.920
now.

32:54.920 --> 32:55.920
Right.

32:55.920 --> 32:56.920
Right.

32:56.920 --> 32:57.920
Yeah.

32:57.920 --> 33:03.480
So we tried to inform them how they could use this.

33:03.480 --> 33:07.680
So that's also what we're investigating right now, how we can best present this to the

33:07.680 --> 33:08.680
users.

33:08.680 --> 33:13.960
I should have asked this earlier, but assuming that kind of the testing of your models

33:13.960 --> 33:22.280
was done against kind of held out data, did you, how do you test this against kind of

33:22.280 --> 33:25.040
real world scenarios, have you done any of that?

33:25.040 --> 33:26.040
Yeah.

33:26.040 --> 33:31.440
So for example, the, well, actually often models, we used like three seasons of data for

33:31.440 --> 33:36.440
that, like to train the models, and to validate it on another season.

33:36.440 --> 33:42.200
And then the results were presented on the, well, on the season that we didn't train

33:42.200 --> 33:43.960
over the data on.

33:43.960 --> 33:48.560
So for example, for the, for the contribution rating aspect, we have like, we have like

33:48.560 --> 33:49.560
the ground truth.

33:49.560 --> 33:54.640
It's like the label is when it goes being scored within 10 actions, the label will be one

33:54.640 --> 33:56.800
and you'll otherwise zero.

33:56.800 --> 34:01.000
So that's how we, well, how we trained that model.

34:01.000 --> 34:07.120
For the others, we, for the pressure model, as explained, we used the ranking provided

34:07.120 --> 34:11.080
by the experts to get that one working.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.080
Very good.

34:12.080 --> 34:15.840
Well, a lot to thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us about your paper.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.040
It's really interesting stuff.

34:17.040 --> 34:18.040
Yeah, thanks.

34:18.040 --> 34:20.040
I enjoyed it.

34:20.040 --> 34:25.520
