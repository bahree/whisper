00:00.000 --> 00:15.920
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

00:15.920 --> 00:20.880
people doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:20.880 --> 00:26.200
I'm your host Sam Charrington and we are back.

00:26.200 --> 00:31.280
First things first, happy new year everyone and welcome to 2018.

00:31.280 --> 00:37.080
I had a great holiday but I've definitely been itching to get back to the show.

00:37.080 --> 00:41.360
As most of you know, at the end of last year we held a listener giveaway to celebrate

00:41.360 --> 00:46.800
hitting one of our biggest milestones to date, 1 million plays of this podcast.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.800
Thanks to everyone who entered.

00:48.800 --> 00:53.200
We sent out an email to entrance a few days ago so please be on a lookout for that.

00:53.200 --> 00:58.760
If you haven't heard from us yet, just reach out to us at teamattwimlai.com so that we can

00:58.760 --> 01:00.920
get you your swag.

01:00.920 --> 01:05.320
Next up, the details for our January meetup are set.

01:05.320 --> 01:11.800
Next Tuesday, January 16th, we'll be joined by veteran Twimble guest and Microsoft researcher

01:11.800 --> 01:13.600
Timnett Gebrew.

01:13.600 --> 01:17.800
Timnett joined us just a few weeks ago to discuss her recently released and much acclaimed

01:17.800 --> 01:22.700
paper using deep learning and Google Street View to estimate the demographic makeup of

01:22.700 --> 01:27.320
neighborhoods across the United States and I'm excited that she'll be joining us to

01:27.320 --> 01:32.800
discuss her paper and the pipeline she used to identify 22 million cars and 50 million

01:32.800 --> 01:34.800
Google Street View images.

01:34.800 --> 01:39.440
I'm anticipating a very lively discussion segment as well in which we'll be exploring

01:39.440 --> 01:43.200
your AI resolutions and predictions for 2018.

01:43.200 --> 01:48.880

01:51.880 --> 01:54.360
Finally, a bit about today's show.

01:54.360 --> 01:59.320
I'm joined by David Venturelli, Science Operations Manager and Quantum Computing Team

01:59.320 --> 02:05.120
Lead for the Universities Space Research Association's Institute for Advanced Computer Science

02:05.120 --> 02:06.800
and NASA Ames.

02:06.800 --> 02:12.000
David joined me backstage at the NYU Future Labs AI Summit a while back to give me some

02:12.000 --> 02:17.520
insight into a topic that I've been curious about for some time now, Quantum Computing.

02:17.520 --> 02:22.360
We kick off our discussion with a review of the core ideas behind Quantum Computing including

02:22.360 --> 02:28.200
what it is, how it's applied, and the ways it relates to computing as we know it today.

02:28.200 --> 02:32.720
We then discuss the practical state of Quantum Computers and what their capabilities are as

02:32.720 --> 02:35.320
well as the kinds of things you can do with them.

02:35.320 --> 02:40.480
And of course, we explore the intersection between AI and Quantum Computing, how Quantum

02:40.480 --> 02:45.080
Computing may one day accelerate machine learning and how interested listeners like you

02:45.080 --> 02:48.360
can get started down the Quantum Computing Rabbit Hole.

02:48.360 --> 02:52.080
And now on to the show.

02:52.080 --> 03:03.040
All right, everyone, I am here at the NYU Scorbal Center backstage just as we're finishing

03:03.040 --> 03:06.680
up the NYU Future Labs AI Summit.

03:06.680 --> 03:11.360
And I have the pleasure of being seated with David Venturelli, who's the Science Operations

03:11.360 --> 03:17.200
Manager for the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science at NASA Ames.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.200
David, welcome to the podcast.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.200
Thank you.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.200
Thank you very much.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.120
It's great to have you on the show.

03:23.120 --> 03:29.400
And I am really looking forward to this conversation because you are doing a ton of work

03:29.400 --> 03:34.520
in an area that I know very little about, but keep hearing a lot about.

03:34.520 --> 03:36.360
And that is Quantum Computing.

03:36.360 --> 03:40.160
So before we get into me peppering you with questions, why don't you just tell us a little

03:40.160 --> 03:44.000
bit about your background and how you got into Quantum Computing yourself?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.000
Yes.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.000
So I'm a physicist.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.680
I'm a theoretical physicist.

03:48.680 --> 03:52.520
And I did study Quantum Mechanics like every physicist does.

03:52.520 --> 04:00.040
Back when I was PhD students in 2008, 2007, there was hype on inside the physics community

04:00.040 --> 04:05.480
about Quantum Computing, but it's nothing but it's nothing like what we have today.

04:05.480 --> 04:09.880
What I did, I did study Quantum Information Science, I did study nanotechnology.

04:09.880 --> 04:18.880
And of course, I have seen in front of me unfolding the opportunities of actually not only validating

04:18.880 --> 04:26.040
the theories on pen and paper, but now experimenting with real world quantum machines.

04:26.040 --> 04:32.960
So I joined Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 2012 as one of the founding members.

04:32.960 --> 04:39.200
NASA, Google and USRA, University Space Research Association, decided to create this

04:39.200 --> 04:48.160
group to investigate the near-term impact of quantum computing for computational problems

04:48.160 --> 04:49.880
of national interest.

04:49.880 --> 04:53.280
And that was, you know, what I've been doing in the last five years.

04:53.280 --> 04:59.320
We managed the projects, collaboration with government, academia, and with, of course,

04:59.320 --> 05:04.880
the principal stakeholders, the private sectors as well, to understand, really, if in the

05:04.880 --> 05:13.440
next five to ten years, there could be an acceleration of computing because of quantum

05:13.440 --> 05:14.440
technologies.

05:14.440 --> 05:15.440
Great.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.440
Great.

05:16.440 --> 05:20.200
I guess the place to start is on quantum technologies and quantum computing.

05:20.200 --> 05:26.760
Like, I imagine that it is something that many in the audience have heard of, but don't

05:26.760 --> 05:33.400
fully understand, you know, not just what the big ideas are, but what are the foundational

05:33.400 --> 05:35.480
ideas upon which it's built.

05:35.480 --> 05:37.720
And I'm hoping maybe you can walk us through some of that.

05:37.720 --> 05:38.720
Yes.

05:38.720 --> 05:47.720
The idea comes from the 80s when one of the gods of physics, Richard Feynman, made the observation

05:47.720 --> 05:54.640
of the conference, the casual observation that if we were able to create a computer which

05:54.640 --> 06:03.240
worked with the laws of quantum physics, then simulating quantum systems would not be

06:03.240 --> 06:07.440
very difficult, while today it's very, very difficult to do that.

06:07.440 --> 06:10.040
We need supercomputers and blah, blah, blah.

06:10.040 --> 06:17.480
So this observation changed the world because the idea of processing information with the

06:17.480 --> 06:25.880
fundamental laws of nature as APIs, as elementary building block of the algorithms, really got

06:25.880 --> 06:35.600
every physicist excited, some early discoveries on the fact that the mathematics of quantum

06:35.600 --> 06:42.200
mechanics is fundamentally more powerful than the mathematics we employ when we process

06:42.200 --> 06:46.800
information in standard digital computers, really got everyone excited.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.600
Can you give us some examples of that?

06:48.600 --> 06:49.600
Yes.

06:49.600 --> 06:57.880
People have discovered in 96 that you can search a database, an unstructured database where

06:57.880 --> 07:04.360
basically all the information is not arranged by any sorting, normally to search such database

07:04.360 --> 07:11.520
you do not have any smart way to do it because you just have to randomly make queries.

07:11.520 --> 07:17.120
And if you're unlucky you will find what you're looking for as the last attempt of your query.

07:17.120 --> 07:21.880
And that means that the problem has linear complexity meaning that if you have n items

07:21.880 --> 07:27.920
you need n trials to get to the item you want in the worst case scenario.

07:27.920 --> 07:33.240
Now if you had the quantum database and the ability of doing quantum queries and you exploit

07:33.240 --> 07:40.600
all these effects of preposition, interference, entanglement, you are able to find the item

07:40.600 --> 07:46.200
you want in a square root of the number of items.

07:46.200 --> 07:51.240
So this means that instead of for example 100 queries you need only 10.

07:51.240 --> 07:57.640
And this quadratic speed up is a very interesting phenomenon which shows by itself that quantum

07:57.640 --> 08:04.120
computing is more powerful than classical computing because there's no way you can beat this

08:04.120 --> 08:05.800
without quantum mechanics.

08:05.800 --> 08:10.360
But what people is really after is exponential speed up.

08:10.360 --> 08:18.600
So the opportunity to devise algorithmic strategies that are able to accelerate exponentially

08:18.600 --> 08:19.600
problems.

08:19.600 --> 08:27.680
There are some examples in cryptography in chemistry where we know how to exponentially

08:27.680 --> 08:33.400
bypass the bottlenecks of computation so that problems that could be solved today in

08:33.400 --> 08:38.800
billions of years they would be solved by a quantum computer in seconds.

08:38.800 --> 08:46.080
Well this is not the case for a lot of things that we want to solve and we are investigating

08:46.080 --> 08:51.640
and it's so difficult to investigate these algorithms without having a quantum computer

08:51.640 --> 08:57.480
that in some sense we want to build quantum computers to understand whether it was worth

08:57.480 --> 08:59.120
to build them in the first place.

08:59.120 --> 09:05.600
So is it fair then to say what I took away from that is that quantum computers isn't

09:05.600 --> 09:12.240
the idea of kind of going piece by piece and replacing the various components on a current

09:12.240 --> 09:14.960
system board with you know quantum versions.

09:14.960 --> 09:21.080
It's not like you know shrinking down the physics is it is a fundamental new way of thinking

09:21.080 --> 09:24.040
about compute that's built around the.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.200
It's a new paradigm.

09:25.200 --> 09:30.600
It's not incremental improvement is really a different fundamental way to process information.

09:30.600 --> 09:38.080
Of course quantum effects are already very well taken care of by the silicon industry in

09:38.080 --> 09:45.080
the integrated circuitry already but today they kind of bother you because you want to

09:45.080 --> 09:48.640
shrink things you want to make them more faster.

09:48.640 --> 09:55.400
Now what we're talking about is assigning a functional role to the quantum effect and

09:55.400 --> 10:04.400
actually assigning logical states and variables to quantum states and then very finely very

10:04.400 --> 10:14.360
delicately orchestrate their quantum dynamics so that we do mathematical operations on our

10:14.360 --> 10:17.920
logical assignments and this is a new paradigm.

10:17.920 --> 10:24.440
It is operating on probability distributions which are weird because they're not over

10:24.440 --> 10:31.120
real numbers they're over complex numbers so there are imaginary units involved and it's

10:31.120 --> 10:37.480
very interesting mathematically and funny enough for the listener of this show you don't

10:37.480 --> 10:43.120
really need to know physics to become a quantum algorithm person.

10:43.120 --> 10:49.160
It's actually linear algebra so as long as you accept why quantum mechanics works you can

10:49.160 --> 10:56.000
study it in an after what if you have the mathematical background you can study it fast and

10:56.000 --> 11:01.560
just you don't know why it works it doesn't matter but you can start writing algorithms

11:01.560 --> 11:07.320
because it's just you know matrix multiplications and things like that.

11:07.320 --> 11:13.440
What are some of the you kind of rattled off some quantum primitives that you know upon

11:13.440 --> 11:17.880
which this math and these computers are built can you kind of give us the next level of

11:17.880 --> 11:20.920
detail and to you know some of the most important ones.

11:20.920 --> 11:29.080
Of course the main paradigm which is explored today is to use binary variables so bits basically

11:29.080 --> 11:35.960
but generalized in the quantum world so the idea of using quantum bits or qubits so you

11:35.960 --> 11:42.240
do identify a physical system it could be a superconductor or it could be an atom it

11:42.240 --> 11:46.720
could be an electron it could be a photon anything anything which is sufficiently small

11:46.720 --> 11:52.680
cold protected from the external environment follows the laws of quantum physics even cats

11:52.680 --> 11:58.920
and boxes apparently so as long as you are you're able to to find that then you you look

11:58.920 --> 12:03.640
at the states of the system and then you identify what is you're called zero and what you

12:03.640 --> 12:09.160
call one for example it could be more states in a quantum system yes but you choose two

12:09.160 --> 12:10.160
of them.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.160
Oh really?

12:11.160 --> 12:17.120
You say you say okay this electron can have spin up or spin down for those that know physics

12:17.120 --> 12:23.600
or this photon can have polarization in one way or in another this superconductor can

12:23.600 --> 12:31.040
have a clockwise current or counterclockwise current and then you look at how you can act

12:31.040 --> 12:37.320
on the system so similarly as you do in chemistry if the system is quantum you can manipulate

12:37.320 --> 12:42.280
their state like in chemistry you can do chemistry reaction but this time you need to be very

12:42.280 --> 12:47.600
controlled so if it is an atom you need to shine a laser if it is a circuit you need to

12:47.600 --> 12:53.520
apply a magnetic field and all these kind of things and when you do that you know how

12:53.520 --> 13:01.080
your state will change the fun fact is that it is totally true in quantum mechanics that

13:01.080 --> 13:05.080
you can have a state which is not zero not one it's kind of a superposition of the

13:05.080 --> 13:13.440
true and is represented by this abstract vector in a complex number subspace where you

13:13.440 --> 13:19.280
represent zero and one at the same time now when you look at it it will be zero or it

13:19.280 --> 13:24.640
will be one with some probability but if you don't look at it then it's both and you

13:24.640 --> 13:29.000
can operate on it like if it is both until you look at it.

13:29.000 --> 13:35.840
So the algorithm the job of the of the programmer is to figure out the way to operate on this

13:35.840 --> 13:43.520
ensemble of qubits in such a way to orchestrate the probability at the end to be the solution

13:43.520 --> 13:49.760
of the problem you want to solve but that's a complex job because you know if you have

13:49.760 --> 13:55.440
and qubits what you are really describing is a state which has an exponential number of

13:55.440 --> 14:02.760
degrees of freedom so and you need to to basically describe it with true to the power of

14:02.760 --> 14:07.720
and complex numbers and there's no way you can simulate this in a machine you need a

14:07.720 --> 14:10.080
quantum computer to experiment most of the time.

14:10.080 --> 14:14.880
So it sounds like one of the fundamental realities of quantum computing is this chicken and egg

14:14.880 --> 14:18.200
problem like how do how do we get beyond that?

14:18.200 --> 14:22.960
Yes you're totally right we are getting beyond that we decided I don't know the chicken

14:22.960 --> 14:29.760
or the egg what we decided but we decided it's worth it's worth to do it and we're starting

14:29.760 --> 14:37.280
there are companies I IBM, Riccetti, Google, Intel, they're all building chips and they're

14:37.280 --> 14:42.360
making them available to the research community and people are trying to use them in the

14:42.360 --> 14:47.400
short term to learn about quantum mechanics to validate the theories that are on pen and

14:47.400 --> 14:50.200
paper have been devised in the last 30 years.

14:50.200 --> 14:57.600
So now we are we are really using quantum computers as tools for improving our knowledge of

14:57.600 --> 14:59.760
quantum information processing.

14:59.760 --> 15:03.760
Yeah so IBM and tell some of these companies that you've mentioned have been talking about

15:03.760 --> 15:08.880
this forever like in in kind of research mode I think the thing that really caught my

15:08.880 --> 15:14.080
attention recently was I think it was their build conference one of the Microsoft's recent

15:14.080 --> 15:18.800
technical conferences there was I think it was a keynote like their main announcement

15:18.800 --> 15:25.240
such in Adela came out and had some researchers and they kind of you know brought out this

15:25.240 --> 15:30.480
I'm not even sure what it was it looked like a GPU to be honest they brought out this board

15:30.480 --> 15:35.240
that was their first attempt at a quantum computer or something you tell me what exactly

15:35.240 --> 15:37.400
that was and what's its significance.

15:37.400 --> 15:44.120
Yeah no Microsoft as well as IBM as you said like everyone had some quantum computing

15:44.120 --> 15:51.480
expertise since the beginning of time meaning since when the field has a name and for good

15:51.480 --> 15:56.960
reasons I mean good physicists kept an eye on the idea since the beginning and and this

15:56.960 --> 16:02.560
company is higher the very good people now what changed now is that people are confident

16:02.560 --> 16:08.680
that we can achieve great results very fast great results in terms of science not not

16:08.680 --> 16:13.520
necessarily an applications yet because in Microsoft for example it's interesting because

16:13.520 --> 16:19.880
they decided to they always had a very good group on architectures and quantum operative

16:19.880 --> 16:27.000
systems and quantum compilation methods but now they decided to expand and go experimental

16:27.000 --> 16:32.480
as well their approach is long term they want to do a topological quantum computing which

16:32.480 --> 16:42.720
is a complicated mathematical theory which is allowing this type of computer to be automatically

16:42.720 --> 16:50.960
protected against the noise of the external world so it would be amazing if it ever works

16:50.960 --> 16:57.440
however as far as we know nobody has ever even created a single qubit so everyone is really

16:57.440 --> 17:03.480
looking at what they are thinking of doing because even the announcement of a single qubit

17:03.480 --> 17:05.720
would be would be interesting.

17:05.720 --> 17:12.800
So let me just hit pause on that so the the qubit is the fundamental unit of this computer

17:12.800 --> 17:18.840
it's it's the bit in contemporary computing yes and we've not produced one yet no no

17:18.840 --> 17:28.440
in the approach that Microsoft was they didn't now for to give you access so IBM as 16

17:28.440 --> 17:35.240
qubits operational allowing researchers to use them and we'll use a 16 qubits does that

17:35.240 --> 17:42.560
mean 16 bits just 16 is not 16 that's an array of 16 oh okay no no you you can not

17:42.560 --> 17:50.600
even solve a Sudoku with that it's it's nothing okay Google has nine but 22 under testing

17:50.600 --> 17:58.080
49 announced then Regeri has about eight now D wave has two thousand which is oh my

17:58.080 --> 18:04.120
god D wave is so far ahead this is D wave is a Canadian company which kind of schooled

18:04.120 --> 18:10.280
the world in the fact that you can't try to build a quantum computer and they did before

18:10.280 --> 18:16.880
everyone and that's even why my group exists because Google decided to buy one of these

18:16.880 --> 18:23.160
machines a D wave machine at one of the D wave machines yes okay and to host it at NASA

18:23.160 --> 18:29.120
and that we operated and this analogous to you know mainframe computers where it takes

18:29.120 --> 18:40.680
a huge black box which of 40 bits no it's a 2000 but 2000 there's a catch there so first

18:40.680 --> 18:46.080
of all so this is a huge machine it operates with cryogenic temperature saw a 13 milli Kelvin

18:46.080 --> 18:52.760
we're talking about less than the temperature of space it requires a vacuum it requires a

18:52.760 --> 18:59.080
helium it's a compact machine but it implements one strategy of computation which is quite

18:59.080 --> 19:06.520
unknown meaning that not so so well studied which is called quantum annealing which does not

19:06.520 --> 19:12.440
have all the requirements of the other kind of computation but at the same time it's unclear

19:12.440 --> 19:18.520
the power of it so they decided indeed to create it to to experiment and and and NASA and

19:18.520 --> 19:23.320
Google and us array decided to support the project and then after this Locked Martin bought

19:23.320 --> 19:26.920
a machine Los Alamos bought a machine so now they're doing quite well how much does one of

19:26.920 --> 19:33.000
these machines cost? Street price is from 10 million to 15 million I don't want to

19:33.000 --> 19:39.720
ask them for the latest quote I don't know but it's it's actually I want to advertise in this

19:39.720 --> 19:47.160
show everyone can use this machine a us array has a program a collaboration program for which 20%

19:47.160 --> 19:54.600
of the machine time can be outsourced to any researcher which is submitting a proposal it's just

19:54.600 --> 20:04.680
the five pages proposal so the the website where to find it is www.usra.edu slash quantum

20:04.680 --> 20:13.000
and slash RFP request for proposal but so us array quantum d wave if if you google it people can

20:13.000 --> 20:19.960
find and we have about 80 people 80 80 groups 80 research groups from all all kind of universities

20:19.960 --> 20:25.320
around the world which are running on the machine or they they propose some of them are running

20:25.320 --> 20:30.440
some not yet but it's a very successful problem wow and is all is all of the research that's

20:30.440 --> 20:39.720
happening on this machine about how to build more machines like it or they are people doing you

20:39.720 --> 20:44.920
know how far we in in terms of doing things with it can we add one plus one yet with this machine

20:44.920 --> 20:50.520
yeah now we can we can do more than that but not much more than that no you're totally right let's

20:50.520 --> 20:58.600
say 90 percent of the really invested research is of fundamental nature we need to improve our

20:58.600 --> 21:05.560
understanding get different mindset and figuring out how to improve these machines themselves

21:05.560 --> 21:10.360
at the same time I say that the programming this kind of machines using this kind of machines

21:10.360 --> 21:18.120
can often lead to new ideas in classical computing because you need to change the mindset to frame

21:18.120 --> 21:23.880
the problem in a different way in order to be attacked by the quantum computers so very

21:24.520 --> 21:29.880
there are a lot of anecdotes of you know people coming up with the quantum algorithm that is

21:29.880 --> 21:36.360
beating every possible classical algorithm that every classical algorithm was created before

21:36.360 --> 21:41.560
and then the classical guys came back say wait a second I can improve my algorithm and then

21:41.560 --> 21:46.840
they improved and they baited the quantum again and so on any any examples that come about yeah

21:46.840 --> 21:54.600
but it's very nerdy example there's a recent recent recent result on QAOA which is

21:55.480 --> 22:04.040
baptized by us the quantum alternating operator and that algorithm okay which is shown to basically

22:04.040 --> 22:13.000
have a particular scaling which seemed to be better to what was before known on a problem which

22:13.720 --> 22:21.320
E3-Lin it's basically connected to satisfiability but the point is like a very specific problem it

22:21.320 --> 22:27.640
seemed that this algorithm was was beating it and then the people and then the classical computer

22:27.640 --> 22:34.680
scientists came back and they improved their own algorithm so this is the latest example in general

22:34.680 --> 22:39.560
I mean it's it's fun quantum computing because there's so much room for improvement in our

22:39.560 --> 22:46.040
understanding that it's really fun for instance chemistry chemistry is the only grave of quantum

22:46.040 --> 22:52.360
computing because we can simulate molecules much faster and and people were were writing on the

22:52.360 --> 22:59.160
back of the envelope calculations seven years ago six seven years ago on how fast the quantum

22:59.160 --> 23:07.080
computer would solve for example the molecular ground state of interesting molecules such as

23:07.080 --> 23:13.160
ferrodoxin I remember it's a fertilizer it's interesting and people were we're trying to

23:13.160 --> 23:19.400
calculate it and say okay it would still take some billions of years okay it's not very interesting

23:19.400 --> 23:23.160
because okay with the classical computer it's impossible we'll take trillions of years one

23:23.160 --> 23:29.080
to be able to take billions okay it's not very very worth doing it but then you know new postdocs

23:29.080 --> 23:34.440
looked at the problem and say now wait a second it's not scaling as n to the power of 11 it's

23:34.440 --> 23:39.720
scaling as n to the power of nine because I can do this mathematical tricks and then new postdocs

23:39.720 --> 23:43.880
and PhD students look at the problem say wait a second why don't I do this transformation before

23:43.880 --> 23:48.440
and I represent the problem with Gaussian waves instead blah blah blah and then they put it down

23:48.440 --> 23:56.120
to a few years say well it's still you know not very interesting but then in a matter of like

23:56.120 --> 24:01.400
I don't know a few months other groups improved improved improved and now we're talking seconds

24:01.400 --> 24:09.080
wow so on that particular project on a specific molecule that people investigated you know

24:09.080 --> 24:16.600
the initial estimates based on quantum mechanics understanding were so improvable that they brought

24:16.600 --> 24:22.920
that they brought down n to the power of 11 to n to the power of three and and make the things

24:22.920 --> 24:29.880
much more tractable and so now what does that what are the requirements of implementing this algorithm

24:29.880 --> 24:36.280
that they've designed in terms of a quantum computer does our d wave 2000 bit thing get us anywhere

24:36.280 --> 24:44.600
near that or no so d wave as I was mentioning before they can attack only some specific algorithms

24:44.600 --> 24:50.920
combinatorial optimization with the specific method and it's unclear what the performance of

24:50.920 --> 24:56.760
this machine can be we are investigating them early results is that it's comparable with the

24:57.400 --> 25:03.160
Intel chips on these small problems now we would like to investigate them on large problems so

25:03.160 --> 25:06.920
that we really could see the difference because now we're still talking about problems you can

25:06.920 --> 25:13.000
solve in seconds so it's not really clear the overhead how much it counts and blah blah blah but

25:13.000 --> 25:19.720
this this is interesting for d wave because again every every machine in the release is a little

25:19.720 --> 25:24.760
bit more powerful in the previous one also on a qualitative level they give you more knobs they

25:24.760 --> 25:29.960
give you more physical effects to experiment so that's interesting but to run the algorithms

25:29.960 --> 25:36.440
of for chemistry for for database search that discuss our cryptography you need the computers

25:36.440 --> 25:43.640
such as the ones which are created by now by ibn google which right now are at this nine qubit

25:43.640 --> 25:49.720
16 qubit stage because they're much more difficult to build because they give you much more control

25:49.720 --> 25:54.680
and they're called the universal digital quantum computers as opposed to the d wave which is an

25:54.680 --> 26:02.600
analog quantum annealer it's a little bit different flavor so this if I could paraphrase the

26:02.600 --> 26:09.080
architecture of the this d wave computer is limited in some way so that it can only you can only

26:09.080 --> 26:15.320
implement these quantum annealing algorithms and that's a sounds like a smallish subset actually

26:15.320 --> 26:20.840
we don't really know exactly we don't know what types of algorithms will be easier to build the

26:20.840 --> 26:28.360
computers but much more limited in their algorithmical encoding to to give you an idea with 2000 qubits

26:28.360 --> 26:34.840
we can more or less solve the problems of that you can classical problems you can encode in

26:34.840 --> 26:40.840
50 bits roughly okay it could be 60 sometimes 100 it depends on the compilation

26:40.840 --> 26:48.840
and is that like is that 2000 bits or the 50 bits is this the entire state of the computer like

26:48.840 --> 26:54.680
including like a traditional computer has you know there's state in the CPU there are registers

26:54.680 --> 27:01.480
there is all of these yeah so yes no different yes no it's let's say no no no no your your

27:01.480 --> 27:07.960
question is on point the end to end solvers will be hybrid you know system which have a classical

27:07.960 --> 27:16.200
co-processor quantum processor so after all you can decompose your problem pre-process it divided

27:16.200 --> 27:21.400
in chunks so that the quantum computer just solves the combinatorial aspect of it and the other

27:21.400 --> 27:27.960
does something in parallel so we're way behind in figuring out what's the best way to solve

27:28.440 --> 27:34.680
you know a full problem we are experimenting right now on on on very specific special purpose

27:35.240 --> 27:41.640
problems and in that case yes we can use only this little memory and but it's improving at every

27:41.640 --> 27:46.280
at every stage okay so the next generation machine probably will be much better than the previous

27:46.280 --> 27:50.840
one and how many bits do we need to get to on the universal side to be useful yeah

27:50.840 --> 27:55.480
that's a good question so it depends on the approach for example the Microsoft approach could be

27:56.360 --> 28:01.160
could be a few hundred for the Microsoft approach but they don't even have one okay

28:02.600 --> 28:07.720
but for the the other approach is like the ones which are superconducting we likely need

28:08.360 --> 28:13.800
almost a million oh wow almost I mean we're at nine yes I mean the scalability is there

28:14.520 --> 28:19.000
what is more difficult is the error correction the error correction we have very good theories

28:19.000 --> 28:25.560
but we need to get the fidelity of the operations to a certain level of precision but there's no

28:25.560 --> 28:30.600
fundamental reason why we shouldn't be able to do that with good engineering you need to understand

28:30.600 --> 28:37.640
that the quantum engineer job is a new job I mean everyone which worked on this is physicist and

28:37.640 --> 28:47.560
physicist do not know how to you know build products yeah yeah so I mean and so now engineers

28:47.560 --> 28:54.040
are getting are getting to this game so I believe that we will have very interesting machines soon

28:54.040 --> 28:59.960
and there's not only the big players that are startups which come out spun off of universities

28:59.960 --> 29:07.800
for example ion cube out of Maryland is doing an amazing job with the ion trap ion cube ion

29:07.800 --> 29:13.640
cube cube ion cube okay they're they're trapping atoms with lasers and manipulating them they're

29:13.640 --> 29:19.800
very very very good at this there's a University of Bristol group I mean in the UK which

29:20.360 --> 29:29.080
has some stealth operation on fully photonic computers so basically a lot of lasers so I believe

29:29.080 --> 29:35.080
in the landscape one year from now will be already different from significantly from the

29:35.080 --> 29:41.480
landscape of today wow wow and that's fun so we haven't even gotten to AI yet like what's the

29:41.480 --> 29:47.240
intersection between you're at the quantum AI lab what's the intersection between quantum computing

29:47.240 --> 29:53.320
and AI it's a very very good question so our name is might be a little misleading we have a

29:53.320 --> 29:59.800
is it quantum slash AI no no no like quantum AI it's quantum AI first of all AI is not only

29:59.800 --> 30:06.360
machine learning there's a lot of methods that are considered AI since even before the

30:06.360 --> 30:12.280
hype on machine learning took off so we do a lot of optimization it's part of the AI we do a

30:12.280 --> 30:18.280
lot of planning and scheduling which is one of my personal work where we actually have to

30:18.280 --> 30:25.160
take decisions of how robots operate on distant planets okay how to take the robust decisions

30:25.160 --> 30:31.000
that's the problem that you you need to solve by model based algorithmics so so that's that's

30:31.000 --> 30:36.760
why there's an AI in our name because we do pay particular attention to problems where

30:37.320 --> 30:44.680
there's not good solution yet and we need expert artificial systems to solve them but the

30:44.680 --> 30:52.920
intersection of quantum computing and AI is interesting even beyond what we do in the quantum

30:52.920 --> 31:00.520
artificial intelligence laboratory the intersection could be on a technical standpoint on machine learning

31:00.520 --> 31:06.680
there are approaches which are being investigated this is a very new field so we're talking about

31:06.680 --> 31:15.480
only a few years of research where you can apply some algorithms of quantum computing to gain

31:15.480 --> 31:22.360
polynomial speed ups on certain aspects for example training the neural networks there are

31:22.360 --> 31:31.800
approaches where you can use quantum correlations to implement quantum neural networks okay I mean

31:31.800 --> 31:36.440
this requires a huge number of qubits of course but people are actually looking at this kind of

31:36.440 --> 31:44.920
and and this quantum neural networks might be very good at learning quantum problems so again

31:44.920 --> 31:50.440
it's a little bit to self-referential but but that's that's another approach that is being

31:50.440 --> 31:55.800
investigated and I must say there's an intersection on the other point of the arrows that there's

31:55.800 --> 32:03.320
a lot that AI can do for quantum computing okay so the payoff will come afterwards quantum

32:03.320 --> 32:07.960
computing will pay back in 10 years or something but for now what are some of those ideas do you

32:07.960 --> 32:15.320
think even compiling a problem into a quantum computer is a big problem and you need and you need

32:15.320 --> 32:23.720
method optimization on steroids calibrating a quantum computer is also a pain in okay I mean

32:23.720 --> 32:30.200
it's crazy and again laboratories are our training neural networks and they are they are

32:30.920 --> 32:39.240
employing heavy heuristics to be able to do that so there is an opportunity on both ends to

32:39.240 --> 32:48.360
imagine what quantum computing can do for AI and how to employ AI to enable quantum computing wow

32:48.360 --> 32:56.600
we're getting to the end of our time but is there a kind of a canonical reference or a place

32:56.600 --> 33:03.000
that people can start if they want to learn more about quantum AI or not quantum AI but quantum

33:03.000 --> 33:10.920
computing yes there are a lot tutorials which have been published over over the years not like

33:10.920 --> 33:19.240
build your own qubits no with a 3d printer really it's really not that inaccessible as it was

33:19.240 --> 33:26.520
few years ago okay so my suggestion is to look for the reviews and the lecture notes of the most

33:26.520 --> 33:34.440
prominent professors in the field I suggest to look at the for example John Preskyl's lecture

33:34.440 --> 33:41.000
notes Caltech that's a good start there's another very very skilled evangelizers of quantum

33:41.000 --> 33:46.840
computing is Scott Aronson he has a fantastic blog which is very followed where he discusses

33:47.400 --> 33:54.680
a lot of aspects of quantum computing so I'm sure that if the listener to this show are motivated

33:54.680 --> 34:02.040
they will find their way and of course please feel free to contact me my my email is Davide David

34:02.040 --> 34:10.120
