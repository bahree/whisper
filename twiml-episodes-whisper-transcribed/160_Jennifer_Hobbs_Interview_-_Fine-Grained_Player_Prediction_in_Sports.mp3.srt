00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:31,280
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:36,960
This week on the pod we are excited to present our AI and sports series, perhaps especially

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,520
apropos given that much of the globe is glued to the world cup at the moment.

6
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,320
While I'm not personally the biggest sports fan, my producer Amari is a huge sports follower

7
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,600
and this series has been something he's wanted to see for a while now.

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,680
So if you like these shows, be sure to send them a shout out on Twitter at at Twimble underscore

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,040
Amari, I am ARI.

10
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,720
In this episode of the series, I'm joined by Jennifer Hobbs, senior data scientist at

11
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,560
Stats, a collector and distributor of sports data, covering sports like basketball, soccer,

12
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,280
American football and rugby.

13
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,600
Jennifer and I explore the stats data pipeline and how they collect and store different types

14
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,440
of data for easy consumption and application.

15
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,680
We dig into the paper she co-authored, Mythbusting set pieces in soccer, which takes a look

16
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,560
at the data surrounding free kicks and corner kicks in soccer and an effort to debunk

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,440
some longstanding myths around various situations.

18
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,440
If you're using machine learning to try to predict world cup winners, you'll definitely

19
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,040
want to check out this segment.

20
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,120
Finally, Jennifer and I chat about potential projects and applications of machine learning

21
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,760
to sports and the accessibility of sports specific data sets to hobbyists.

22
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:57,000
Alright, let's do it.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,240
Alright everyone, I am on the line with Jennifer Hobbs, Jennifer is a senior data scientist

24
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,240
with Stats.

25
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,480
Jennifer, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

26
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,200
Great, thanks for having me.

27
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:14,680
Awesome, so you got your PhD in physics and astronomy.

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,600
How did you make your way to data science and just as interestingly, how did you make

29
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,320
your way into sports data science?

30
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,600
Sure, so my background is starting from undergraduate, I was at Northwestern, I was in the Integrated

31
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:34,400
Science program and also study math and physics, actually originally started out in neutrino

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,760
physics and did research at Fermi lab for several years, starting when I was in undergraduate

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,640
and then continuing into my PhD.

34
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,280
And about maybe during my first or second year of my PhD, I realized that that's not quite

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,760
where my passion was and you know, looked at a couple of different labs and I'd always

36
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,480
had an interest in neuroscience and kind of how the brain worked and so I wound up working

37
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,240
with a professor who was in a biomedical engineering and mechanical engineering lab looking

38
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:08,800
at how the brain encodes touch and so in particular studying the rat whiskers system.

39
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,160
So I joined MATLAB, I started doing some behavioral as well as computational neuroscience work

40
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:19,120
and really through that is how I kind of became exposed to machine learning.

41
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,360
I really had it had any exposure or really knowledge of the field prior to that but

42
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,320
just particularly through a neural coding project that I work on really started to learn

43
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,920
about all of the you know, work that had been done in you know, pattern recognition and

44
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,720
machine learning for years and really found that to be my passion and got involved in that.

45
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,800
And then after graduating, I was actually at a insurance company doing predictive analytics

46
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,880
for a year and then this position at STATS opened up where they are you know, creating

47
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:57,960
a new AI data science team to you know, leverage this wealth of data that STATS has and to

48
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,200
you know, produce new insights and you know, leverage machine learning and AI to really

49
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,200
kind of revolutionize how we understand and ingest and even take sports data.

50
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,200
Interesting.

51
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,360
So that first exposure to machine learning from neuroscience perspective was that you

52
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,840
mentioned that was a project that you worked on as opposed to a class.

53
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,360
Can you elaborate on it?

54
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,360
Sure.

55
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,880
So one of the great things about my graduate school lab was that we were from all sorts

56
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,560
of different departments.

57
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:33,560
So I was in physics, we had applied math people, neuroscience students, BME students,

58
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,880
MECI students all in the same lab which made it you know, a great really kind of fertile

59
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,360
cross collaboration.

60
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,240
And one of the students who was BME, more on the BME neuroscience side, he had been taking

61
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,440
all of this neural recordings from primary sensory neurons and saying like, well, how do

62
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,960
we understand what the brain is actually encoding?

63
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:59,560
What is the actual original input and the appropriate representation that goes into the neurons

64
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:05,720
that the rat could be using to make these discrimination tasks much higher up kind of

65
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,000
later in the processing stage.

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,760
And so I was asked to kind of be involved in the project and kind of help do that because

67
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,840
I had the more you know, mathematical background.

68
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,480
And so really was just kind of like here's here's a problem we're trying to solve.

69
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,840
We have whiskers that are being tracked from there it goes into a mechanical model.

70
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,800
We can get forces and moments and we want to predict and then we have neural recordings.

71
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,800
We have an electrical signal from that we can extract spikes and we basically want to

72
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,600
go from you know, mechanics to spikes and see where those see what the neurons are

73
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
encoding.

74
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,080
And in trying to solve it, that's really where I got you know, got exposed.

75
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:47,520
And so, you know, we were using things like general literary models, but in the process

76
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,320
of learning that, then I was just exposed to the whole you know, breath and wealth of techniques

77
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
that were out there.

78
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
Yeah.

79
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,280
I never cease to be fascinated by this kind of two way relationship between neuroscience

80
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,440
and machine learning where learning and being inspired by neuroscience to innovate on

81
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,840
the machine learning side, but neuroscience is also benefiting heavily from that innovation

82
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:18,400
and the way they understand neurons, super interesting work.

83
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,400
What does that do?

84
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:26,160
You know, you kind of mentioned sports and sports data, but what's the idea behind the company?

85
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,160
Yeah.

86
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,480
So, so, status has, you know, been around for about 35 years and we have this huge amount

87
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,640
of data that we collect across all types of sports, you know, common sports that you

88
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,760
think of, you know, football, basketball, baseball, but also something that you've probably

89
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,400
never have and you'll, you'll, you'll never, never experience because they're, they're

90
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,400
more remote.

91
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,040
And so, we have all of, all of these kind of records and data that exists there, but in addition

92
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,880
to that, you know, for certain sports, we have kind of a next level of data that's our

93
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,880
event data.

94
00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:02,120
So, if you were to look at a sport like soccer, we know where, you know, we know information

95
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,800
about passes and shots and things like that that we can use to further understand the game

96
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,440
to really start telling, you know, a better story of what actually occurs and who's contributing

97
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,640
and how.

98
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:19,240
And then kind of as a, the layer on top of that, again, in sports like, like soccer and

99
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,080
basketball, we have player and ball tracking information.

100
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,000
So really at, at every point during a game, we know where all the players are on the field

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,240
and we know where, where the ball is.

102
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,480
And then that really allows us to tell, you know, an even richer story and understand

103
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:39,520
the game and really kind of, you know, draw further insights and do more complex analysis

104
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,400
to really recreate the game from, from this data.

105
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,720
And who is the target or end consumer of the analysis that you're doing?

106
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,560
Is it the teams or consumers like via media products?

107
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,560
Right.

108
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,160
So it spans, it spans everybody.

109
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,120
A lot of it is media facing.

110
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,760
So if you can imagine you're watching, watching a game and a lot of times an announcer will

111
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,880
add some kind of statistics that have to add color to it, you know, very likely that data

112
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,960
is coming from us.

113
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:16,760
And you know, then even as a consumer, if you're, you know, going on to a site or you're

114
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:23,280
asking, you know, first sports statistic, chances are we're providing that data as well.

115
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,520
But also the teams, there's a, you know, team performance space where teams want to know,

116
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,280
again, all of the stats about their players.

117
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,880
And you know, now that as we're, you know, adding more advanced analytics on top of that

118
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,920
through machine learning, you know, how can we actually deliver them insights directly

119
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,360
as opposed to just maybe raw data points?

120
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
Interesting.

121
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,680
I must be the only one that thought that sports announcers just had these amazing statistical

122
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,000
memories for their teams that they follow.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Right.

124
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Right.

125
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
No, it's impressive.

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,360
The amount of manpower from, you know, just at all levels, whether it's, you know,

127
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,760
the kind of the engineering side that creates the database that stores it that allows that

128
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,640
data to be accessed quickly to the more, you know, media facing people who are, you

129
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:10,360
know, in the truck, knowing how to access that data and kind of find the right, you know,

130
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,600
ask the right question to surface the right insight so that you can, can get that kind

131
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,840
of interesting fact during, during the broadcast.

132
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,640
Along those lines, can you talk a little bit about the, I guess your data pipeline, the

133
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,520
way you kind of conceive of and mapping out all of the data that's coming in and the

134
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,880
flows and how you process it?

135
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,880
Sure.

136
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,360
So a lot of that is very, very sport and also like data, data specific.

137
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,560
So how we collect, what I'd call traditional box score data is different from, you know,

138
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,560
the tracking data.

139
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:50,880
So our group focuses primarily on how we make value out of the tracking data.

140
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,040
So for a sport like basketball, for instance, you know, we have, you know, cameras in venue

141
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,560
that would, you know, collect the, you know, track the players and then, you know, produce

142
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,800
these, you know, process it using, you know, computer vision techniques and then extract

143
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,160
the positions and then, you know, intake that for, for later analysis.

144
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,960
And then our group is, you know, releasing, all right, now, you could imagine that the

145
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,560
way you ingest and store data from just kind of a storage perspective is different than

146
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:27,320
how you maybe want to format it to make discoveries and make insights and kind of surface them

147
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
quickly.

148
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,880
So a lot of the work that our group has done has been to really kind of look at a lot

149
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,400
of the advances and technologies in the data space and the end, you know, some of the cloud

150
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,880
computing and no SQL databases out there to, you know, how can we, how can we shape the

151
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:52,320
data in a way that answers questions of interest and allows us to do the analysis that we want?

152
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,120
You know, so then we can, you know, take this raw data and start, you know, start enriching

153
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
it, start adding information on top of it.

154
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,720
I'm going to, again, you could imagine that there's just, there's so much data that for

155
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,160
a single game, you know, depending on the sport, 10, 20, you know, points per player per

156
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,840
second across an entire game, there's, there's a huge amount of data there.

157
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:16,480
So really leveraging a lot of those, uh, the big data stack that exists out there to

158
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,120
process and analyze it and literally just kind of move it around so that it can be surface

159
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
quickly.

160
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Interesting.

161
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:31,280
So do you, does your group or even do you personally identify more with the data engineering

162
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:38,960
and kind of infrastructure side of things or more the statistical analysis and the data

163
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,120
product side of things?

164
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,520
So we really get to interact with it from throughout the entire life cycle because, um,

165
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:51,040
and I think that's really important because the, the representation and the, right, the

166
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,120
way you encode and, and format and understanding records at your data is really critical

167
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,480
for, for any analysis to occur downstream.

168
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,120
So, you know, we work with engineering to actually like, you know, to build the products

169
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,160
to put it into production, but, you know, we're, we're keenly involved in, in saying,

170
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,280
what is that right representation, what is the right storage?

171
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,960
How do we, um, you know, the, how do we format and store this data and describe this

172
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,080
data in a way that really captures all the information and, and is, isn't lossy because

173
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,080
we don't want to do anything to the data that could possibly, um, you know, lose information.

174
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:30,000
And so we're certainly involved in kind of that, that early process and then we do, you

175
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,080
know, work with, with engineering to, um, you know, to build out the pipelines that we

176
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,960
can do the analysis, we build the models and then we get those models into production.

177
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,960
And then we also interact closely with, um, with our design team as far as, all right,

178
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,240
I, you can imagine, you know, I, I have a certain, a certain insight, a certain data point

179
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,760
that I want to surface to the end user, but whether that end user is a team or a consumer

180
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,680
or a media client, the same piece of information could be, uh, ingested in different ways.

181
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,360
So what's the right way of presenting that to, you know, answer the questions that, that

182
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,120
they're looking for?

183
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,560
Do any particular examples come to mind of how the representation, you know, particularly

184
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,240
as deep as, you know, the, the way the data was stored had an impact on the, the insights

185
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,960
that you were ultimately able to derive or the models that you were ultimately able

186
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:31,040
to create and kind of that back and forth between representation and, and product?

187
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
Sure.

188
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,400
So, um, you know, you, you could imagine that, you know, again, for our tracking data,

189
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,720
we have all of the, the positions of the players.

190
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,960
And, and there is so much information there that, you know, um, how it's stored, how it

191
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:48,280
acts as access is, is very, very important for, for processing time, as well as our ability

192
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,720
to do, um, to do analysis.

193
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,080
So, um, one of the things that, that, you know, our group does is that we work directly on,

194
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
on the trajectory.

195
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,400
So given the players, um, you know, we can leverage both the individual player motions,

196
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:05,440
as well as the group structure, uh, that's involved in sports to start, you know, to build

197
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,960
our analysis to, to do our predictions.

198
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:14,160
So, um, one of the challenging things with sport, you can imagine is that they're not just,

199
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,480
you know, think of, think of basketball, they're not just five independent agents per,

200
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,040
team, right, they're, they're interacting with people, um, with their, with their teammates,

201
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:28,120
they're also interacting with the other, uh, their team, um, to try and understand an individual

202
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:33,960
player's movement kind of in isolation is really losing that, that interactiveness, uh,

203
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,960
that exists.

204
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,120
In contrast to, um, say something like pedestrian detection where you have, uh, you know,

205
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,040
we're, you know, a variable number of people out there and they're just kind of trying

206
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,880
to avoid each other and things like that, right, there's a much more complexity in that

207
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,800
kind of group behavior that exists in sports.

208
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,600
And so we're really able to, um, exploit that and work on the trajectories, uh, together

209
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,000
and understand that all of the players are really involved in interacting, um, and from

210
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,800
their build our models, uh, which really allows us to, again, like, to work on that, that

211
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,280
really true raw representation of the data.

212
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:16,880
And so to make sure I understand that is there or at some point in designing this pipeline,

213
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,960
this process, was there a trade-off between whether you stored player information individually

214
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:27,560
or in the context of a team and you chose to do it in the context of a team?

215
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,480
Is that what you're getting at here?

216
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:35,280
So, so from the, from the data model, not as much, um, you know, you can imagine having,

217
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:41,360
I think each player has, has a location, um, but then kind of once we have that stored,

218
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,400
you know, how we leverage it is really, uh, kind of where the, where the keys are, and

219
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,240
maybe I'm not quite, quite following your questions, are you?

220
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:57,840
Oh, no, I was, I was going back to your comment about how you found it important to tie kind

221
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:04,880
of the underlying data engineering to the kind of the work to be done and how you often

222
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,200
find that, you know, the problems you're trying to solve influences the way you need to

223
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,960
store and represent the data at a low level.

224
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:18,200
And I was kind of digging for examples of, you know, where that low level representation,

225
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,720
you know, made a big impact or you, you, you weren't able to accomplish something until

226
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,960
you tweaked that low level representation.

227
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Sure, so, uh, right, really having, you know, information about all the players at every

228
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,480
point in time, um, it is really key.

229
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,400
And so kind of from a data perspective, that's, that's really where we operate.

230
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,360
And then, you know, at the more of the modeling stage, I mean, if you look at a lot of the

231
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:46,840
work that our group has done has been around, like leveraging the formational, uh, alignment

232
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,000
of, of players so that we can really understand again operating directly off of the trajectories

233
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:59,000
as opposed to, um, you know, having to, having to operate, um, yeah, let's see, I'm kind

234
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
of thinking about that.

235
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,920
It sounds like maybe what I'm hearing that is, you, you may have this data that is, you

236
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:10,560
know, it may come in as images, uh, and you have to figure out how to store that.

237
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:19,160
And then you may extract from that x, y, positional information, uh, but you, you know, also

238
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,480
want to eventually get to player trajectories and as opposed to having to figure that out

239
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,320
each time you need to be able to store that.

240
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:31,080
And so there's, there's this constant trying to figure out how to store these things that

241
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,160
you're ultimately going to need to go further with your end products.

242
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,160
Is that where you're going?

243
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,160
Sure.

244
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,200
That's certainly, um, you know, one aspect of it is, you know, extracting as much information

245
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,440
as we can out of the image and then, you know, going through the whole tracking life cycle

246
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,920
as if you will, you know, from detections to, to tracks to really understand, um, where

247
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:55,200
all of the, uh, the players are, um, there's kind of a second step to that, which is, uh,

248
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,200
the group has done a lot of work on search in sports.

249
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,640
So, um, you could imagine that, you know, if you're watching a game and you see a play

250
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,560
and you say, well, that's really interesting.

251
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,680
I want to, I want to know if that's when that play has been run before.

252
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:12,040
I want to find similar plays like how do you, how do you do that with, um, you know, multiple

253
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,480
agents and how do you, how do you search for that?

254
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,400
And you can imagine say, well, if I have, um, you know, all of my data coming in is, is

255
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,720
based on player ID.

256
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,720
I know that this human was standing in this position.

257
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:30,840
But if I'm only looking, if I limit myself to only looking by based on identity, um, it

258
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,640
really kind of limits my ability to find, um, to find those similar plays.

259
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,680
So, uh, a lot of the work that the group has done is to, uh, recognize, again, that, that

260
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:47,440
group structure and to find, um, the, uh, the, the right way to represent them so that

261
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,600
we can, um, find plays based on where a player is in their, uh, positional formation as

262
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,280
opposed to being like kind of stuck to the identity.

263
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,360
So certainly there's kind of two phases there.

264
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,440
There's the, I want to be able to represent the data in my data models that I have all

265
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,120
of it available to me.

266
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:08,400
And then if I want to be able to query it, I don't want to be necessarily bound to something

267
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,840
as hard as identity.

268
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,080
I want to know, um, where the player is in their, in their group position.

269
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,080
Interesting.

270
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,640
So this search function that you're describing, it's not relying at all.

271
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,000
It sounds like on tagged, uh, this is a X play, like a named play or something like that.

272
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,400
It's based on kind of the relative positions of the players.

273
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,400
Correct.

274
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,400
Right.

275
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,760
We want to learn the playbook directly from the data.

276
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,440
So you could imagine a coach, you know, having to go through and say, all right, like,

277
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,320
here's, here's play, here's play alpha, here's, here's play beta, whatever.

278
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,320
Um, and that's obviously very, you know, onerous and time consuming on, on the coach.

279
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,760
Um, but again, you see, you see the structure that exists in sport.

280
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,760
You see certain actions, certain plays that get run repeatedly.

281
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,360
And if, if we can recognize those as kind of entities, you know, our ourselves who are

282
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,480
watching the game, you know, the computer should be able to learn how to do that, uh, by

283
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,720
leveraging machine learning.

284
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,160
So what we're able to do is to, um, to find those similar plays just directly from the

285
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,200
ball and, and player trajectories so that you could imagine, like, here's a similar play.

286
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Here's a play.

287
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Can I find all of the plays just like that?

288
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Huh.

289
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,600
Can you, can you walk us through the, kind of the types of models that you use to do this,

290
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,880
like the input data sounds like positions and trajectories?

291
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,800
Like how do you, uh, how, how does it work, I guess, you know, to the extent that you can

292
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
share it?

293
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,800
Sure.

294
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,640
And again, like members of the group have done, um, a lot of work on this, uh, for a

295
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,640
while.

296
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,120
And it's a little bit, you know, the way we've actually implemented it for different sports

297
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,000
is has some slight subtleties.

298
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,720
But what the general idea is that, um, we kind of, we're able to, to using the trajectories

299
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,680
of all of the players, find where they kind of fit into a, um, into a formation.

300
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:04,160
So we find some kind of, um, ordering that, that preserves the, the structure.

301
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,160
And then from there.

302
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,440
And so if I can, if I can push pause on that, what is, what does that mean?

303
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,840
Like how, how are you representing that?

304
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,840
Is this like, uh, you know, a, a spatial type of model?

305
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:24,240
Like position one is, you know, X, uh, you know, some distance and angle from another

306
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,400
or is it some other kind of thing?

307
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,400
Right.

308
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,640
So, um, it's, in, in some ways, more, more general than that.

309
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,280
So you could imagine for, um, for a sport like soccer, that you say, well, here's, here's

310
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,280
the center back.

311
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,960
And again, you could imagine somebody going through and actually tagging all of the players,

312
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,200
um, but players, players swap positions, uh, they move around.

313
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,680
And so somebody who's kind of nominally in one position in a given play, they might have,

314
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,760
you know, switched with, with their partner just to, to get, you know, back into defensive

315
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,200
position to have all of the spots filled.

316
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,360
And so what we're able to do is say, well, I can actually learn directly from the data

317
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:04,120
um, the, the formation that this team plays.

318
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:09,480
And so even though this person is maybe nominally a left back in this particular play, he got,

319
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,840
you know, he had a switch, you know, places with, with somebody else and he's actually playing

320
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,520
on the right side right now.

321
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,920
And so from their positions, we're actually able to, you know, match them back to, to a

322
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,760
known, uh, known formation and then use their, use their positions at that time, um,

323
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,480
not just some kind of hard coded, uh, tag.

324
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,040
And that really allows us to, to understand, um, their positioning based on, on where

325
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,360
they are in this, again, in this kind of group, formational structure as opposed to, um,

326
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,440
you know, a label that's fixed throughout the course of the game.

327
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
Okay.

328
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:51,680
So the first step is kind of, uh, representing the general formation of the team.

329
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,680
So the player is relative to one another, uh, and then what's next?

330
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:02,320
So, so once we understand where the players are in relationship to, to their, you know,

331
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,040
their formational template, like that allows us to then say, all right, you know, given

332
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:11,280
that I know they're here, I can start to, I can maintain a certain ordering, um, and,

333
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,200
you know, the, for, for machine learning, uh, NAI to work, you know, the computer needs

334
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:22,400
to have some kind of, you know, fixed expectation of how, um, you know, of the incoming order

335
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,440
of, of the features that you're going to pass to it.

336
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,960
So you can imagine that, you know, by knowing where the players are and where they fall

337
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:34,520
in the structure, this allows us to, um, you know, to have that fixed representation

338
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,520
of where they are.

339
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,960
And then from there, we can do, you know, any sort of analysis on top of it.

340
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:43,880
If it's, you know, in this case for search, um, it allows us to start, you know, creating

341
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,880
a consistent metric so that we're comparing, um, comparing, you know, the, the person in,

342
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,880
um, the left-back position always to, you know, other left-backs, even if at the start

343
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:01,200
of the game that he might have been listed as a, as a different positional player.

344
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,240
And you have this formation information.

345
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,760
Do you look at transitions of that formation from, you know, A to B to C relative to the

346
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,280
movement of the ball or things like that over time?

347
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:15,520
Like I guess, you know, the picture that I have in my head when you talk about plays

348
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,880
is like your classic, like, uh, clipboard, you know, player here, player here and then transitions

349
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,320
or trajectories or something like that.

350
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,080
And I'm trying to map all that to, uh, to the machine learning context and what you're

351
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,080
doing.

352
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Sure.

353
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,040
So you could imagine as kind of a base level, you could just say, well, I, I think there's

354
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:37,840
some kind of general formation out there, you know, maybe that, that a team has and

355
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,160
you can certainly learn that.

356
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,560
And then you can say, well, you know, particularly in soccer as the, um, you know, as the ball

357
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:49,480
moves as a team transitions from defense to offense, you really kind of see that, that

358
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
formation change.

359
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,480
You might see them become more aggressive offensively as they get the ball, um, near their attacking

360
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,480
goal.

361
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,360
And you can see the defenders kind of kind of step up and so that, that formation changes.

362
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:06,580
So by using, um, various hierarchical methods, we can actually learn, you know, a set or

363
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:11,720
relationship of, of these different formations and then look to see, well, okay, how does that,

364
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,520
how does it change, um, you know, does, does that formation change?

365
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:20,360
When I'm on an offense versus defense, when I have the ball closer to my goal, um, what

366
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,200
happens if I'm winning or are losing?

367
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,800
Do I start to kind of change that, um, change that formation to, to protect my lead as opposed

368
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,040
to being more aggressive and trying to score?

369
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,960
Um, and so like we have, we have observed those changes, but because we're able to detect

370
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,640
that automatically from the data, you know, it's not something that we have to go through

371
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,960
and kind of get painstakingly labeled, it just, it, it's something that we can detect

372
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,960
automatically.

373
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,960
Right.

374
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,480
The, you mentioned hierarchical methods.

375
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,240
Can you elaborate on that?

376
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
So sure.

377
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,280
So one of our team members had done work particularly and basketball on this just as we're,

378
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:00,080
as we're learning these, um, these kind of different, uh, different templates for these

379
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:07,120
different states, um, he has an approach to do, um, multi agent hierarchical clustering.

380
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:14,080
So again, we have trajectories for, uh, you know, uh, for all of the players and we can

381
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,440
say, all right, like what's the, how do we find kind of again that, that base formation?

382
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,560
And then from there saying, all right, like this is kind of, this is a certain, a certain

383
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
state.

384
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:28,960
And then we kind of step into that and say, um, all right, like what's the right way to

385
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,440
essentially, um, you know, order of players within that, within that state.

386
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,240
And then from there, can I split that out, do substates exist, um, you know, are there

387
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,040
additional, um, you know, clusters within there and kind of keep, keep breaking down and

388
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:46,840
doing this approach until we can, you know, find these very specific, um, play states

389
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,760
that, that we can, can identify.

390
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:55,160
I came across a paper that you co-authored about myth-busting set pieces and soccer.

391
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,160
Uh-huh.

392
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,280
Can you share, uh, what that one is about?

393
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:05,800
So this is a paper that, um, that we, uh, presented at Sloan this past year and, uh, set pieces

394
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:10,720
are, you know, something that teams are really interested in because, um, you know, they,

395
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,760
they can, you know, produce a lot of, um, scoring opportunities, but there's also some myths

396
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,600
about, well, when I, um, you know, when I take a set piece, if I'm too aggressive, like

397
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,040
is it going to lead, you know, to a chance by the other team?

398
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,000
And so really, the idea here was to just kind of go through, um, some of the commonly

399
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,360
held, uh, held beliefs are, around set pieces and really just, you know, look at, look at

400
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,360
what the data says.

401
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:38,000
Instead of going, you know, by, by your gut, can we actually go through and, and, and kind

402
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,560
of tick these off and say, you know, what does the data actually support?

403
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:46,440
And I think that's one of the, you know, really exciting things about what we do in this

404
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,840
group is that, um, you know, a lot of people, you know, whether it's coach, whether it's

405
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:54,600
a fan, they've, you know, seen a lot of sport they have and tuition for it.

406
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,160
They have, um, you know, these kind of gut, gut instances to what's there.

407
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:05,080
But really with the availability of, of tracking data, we can actually get to what, what

408
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,320
the data says and actually answer these types of questions that really just aren't, aren't

409
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,520
available, um, otherwise.

410
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:18,720
And for those that don't know set pieces or like corner cakes and free kicks and soccer.

411
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
Yes.

412
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,720
Yeah.

413
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,120
And another question I had was in that paper there where you hasn't like, it really

414
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:31,360
interesting heat maps of the player positions relative to these set pieces is that produced

415
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,040
from the like the visual positioning data that you get.

416
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Correct.

417
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,880
So, you know, at a certain level, we can just look to, you know, look at the ball on C where

418
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,000
teams attempt to, to deliver a kick, uh, in these scenarios, but then we can kind of go

419
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,720
a step further and say, all right, let's use the tracking data to maybe understand how,

420
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,520
teams defend corners, for instance.

421
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,040
And so in that case, again, we have the, we have all the player tracking data and using

422
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:06,160
a convolutional or neural net, we can try, we can, you know, use, use the data and determine

423
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,680
whether a team is in a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a defense or a man-demand

424
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,960
defense or something and more of a hybrid.

425
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,400
And then once we have, we're able to detect that, then we can say, all right, like does

426
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,960
that lead to do, do any of these, um, lead to more goals than, than the other?

427
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:27,360
So this sounds like it maybe ties to some of the, the previous work that we discussed

428
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,120
where you've figured out through maybe these hierarchical approaches that you've used

429
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:37,000
or the, the templates, like, you know, these types of defenses and then you've, maybe

430
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,960
have those labeled somewhere as like labeled pictures, you know, this is, this defense

431
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:48,760
this is another, and then you use that as the input to, uh, CNN classifier to figure

432
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,480
out, uh, for a given image.

433
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
Is that what you're doing?

434
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
Right.

435
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,120
So in the case of, of set pieces, it's a little bit different than, than open play.

436
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:01,160
Like you imagine it, in open play, again, there's this really strong, formational signature

437
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:08,040
that exists, um, for something like a corner, the way player set up is, um, more, more chaotic,

438
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:12,120
uh, it kind of lacks that, that, you know, strong and form, formation that, that you

439
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
would imagine.

440
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:19,120
Um, and so here we actually, um, in this work, just operated like directly on, um, I'm

441
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:23,160
like the image representation of the player, so you can imagine, um, you know, knowing where

442
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:28,400
each player is thinking of it, um, you know, as, as having a, uh, point, point in an image

443
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,000
being being occupied.

444
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,440
And then from there saying, right, if I know how they're moving, I can, um, detect certain,

445
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,160
certain features, you know, using the CNN, uh, and then from some labels.

446
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:43,360
So, um, so Paul, who was the first author on the paper, um, he has a, you know, tremendous

447
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,000
background, uh, in, in soccer.

448
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,640
And so, um, he was able to, you know, to go through and like, look at, look at the video,

449
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,880
look at the trajectories and say, all right, this is a, this isn't, uh, example of, of

450
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,480
a hybrid defense, as opposed to a man defense, as opposed to a zone defense.

451
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,560
And then once we have those, um, you know, it build the, the class fire to detect those

452
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:08,480
automatically going forward, you, you took like a myth busting type of approach, uh, in

453
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,840
the paper, obviously given the title and you identified 10 specific, uh, myths that

454
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:21,120
folks held about these types of situations, like, um, a team is more likely to score from

455
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,320
a free kick cross compared to a corner.

456
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,800
And then why you busted that myth and show, no, there's only a 2% chance of, of scoring

457
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:35,400
from the corner, as opposed to a 1% chance of scoring from the, the free kick.

458
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,840
And there were a bunch of other, of these types of myths.

459
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:45,800
Was there any that was most kind of surprising or, or interesting to the team?

460
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,640
I think the, the work that just, um, you know, I, I, identifying the defenses, uh, that

461
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,280
the teams are playing was really interesting, just cut seeing the, the relative frequencies

462
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,360
that that each played in was interesting.

463
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,200
Well, I think the one that I think most surprised, uh, most people on the team was about, um,

464
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,240
defending, uh, defending the post.

465
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:10,240
So I think a lot of people, um, believe that, you know, you should put a man on, on at

466
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,760
least one of the posts near and or far, um, but what, uh, you know, what this work showed

467
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,360
was that, um, having players on both posts actually, you know, conceded the most number

468
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,720
of goals, um, while having a player on, on the back post, uh, conceded the, conceded

469
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,640
the fewest and, um, you know, in some ways, you say, well, I, I, I don't know, I, I know,

470
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,520
you know, by, by putting a player on the post, you're, you're certainly kind of cutting

471
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:37,920
down on the angle, but you're in some ways giving the offense more freedom to, to move

472
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:38,920
around.

473
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:43,560
So I think that's one instance where people have really strong feelings either, either

474
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:48,240
way, you know, one way or the other, um, so, uh, I think that was probably the most,

475
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,240
most surprising to, to members of the team.

476
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,920
Can you talk a little bit about the way you processed your data for, for this particular

477
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
task?

478
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,920
Um, right.

479
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,920
So, so for all of this, you know, we've leveraged both the event data that we have,

480
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:08,520
again, that has things like, um, shots, passes, crosses, corners, the type of pass where

481
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,160
it occurred from, who took it, um, as well as, as well as the tracking data.

482
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:17,040
And so, um, you know, like in, in much of the work that we do, it's really a matter of,

483
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,880
of bringing them all together, um, and here was a combination of both, you know, in some

484
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:27,200
cases, constructing features, you know, by hand that we can analyze, um, as well as,

485
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:32,400
you know, in the case of like detecting the defense, um, you know, using, using, uh, you

486
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,240
know, deep learning approaches to, in some way, you know, construct the features for

487
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
us.

488
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,600
Um, so, you know, it was, uh, a really nice paper because it really brought together

489
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,720
in, in some ways, like, all facets of both the data and the, and the, uh, analysis

490
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,120
side, the events and the tracking, as well as kind of the handcrafted features, as well

491
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,240
as the, uh, the deep learned features.

492
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:58,960
And in, in addition to the specific, uh, the, the myths that you busted, you also looked

493
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:06,040
at the predictive power of the, the model, like the model's ability to predict whether

494
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:13,680
a given team, you know, what formation a, a team is likely to take given, uh, one of

495
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:20,000
these set points or set pieces, rather, um, how successful was that part of the project?

496
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,240
Um, are you talking about the, um, defense or, or just like the, the general, um, set

497
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,240
up part?

498
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:36,360
Uh, well, I, I, I, I, I thought I saw it in there, an element of predicting what a given

499
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:41,280
team was likely to do, I guess, defensively, uh, okay, sure, right.

500
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,000
So, you know, again, this, this used both the, the events as well as the tracking data,

501
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,480
but, um, you know, we can go through and look at, you know, all, all of the set pieces

502
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,440
that, um, a team has taken over the course of the season and say, all right, you know,

503
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,680
offensively, do they take, you know, in swinging and outs or versus out swinging corners,

504
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,240
you know, short corners, um, you know, do they attempt to do flick-ons?

505
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,560
Um, and how often, you know, do they, you know, try to use the style as well as how successful

506
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,200
are they at, at executing, uh, on that style?

507
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,960
And then defensively, again, you know, having been able to detect the type of, of set-ups

508
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,160
that they use, um, you know, how likely are they to set up in a certain situation?

509
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:28,240
And then, um, you know, when they set up that way, how likely is that to, to lead to a goal?

510
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,600
And so at, at a glance, we can kind of look at teams and their, um, frequency and their

511
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,520
success in each of these styles and say, you know, what, how do they likely play or when

512
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,520
they're playing well?

513
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,000
How, how do they likely set up?

514
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,760
And then from there, we can say, okay, um, you know, given two teams, I can imagine, um,

515
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:50,640
you know, predicting, you know, the, given the offensive style of one and the defensive

516
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,720
style of the other, how might they match up?

517
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:59,560
It sounds like the, the predictions that you were doing about, you know, what a team is

518
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:05,000
likely to do in any given situation, we're not match-up based, I don't know if this question

519
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
makes any sense.

520
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,440
I think what you're getting at is, um, so in, in this particular paper, we didn't, um,

521
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,080
we didn't do predictions off of the, the match-up.

522
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,080
That's kind of the, yeah.

523
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,080
The next step.

524
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:22,160
You know, what we are looking at here is kind of how, how strong is the stylistic signature

525
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,160
of a team?

526
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,000
You know, certain teams, you could imagine that, um, they might want to take, you know,

527
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,320
the same, the same corner, the same way, every single time, regardless of, of who they're

528
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,320
playing or how, how the defense sets up.

529
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,760
Maybe they're very, very predictable just historically.

530
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:41,440
But another team could be, um, you know, it's, I don't, I don't really care how I take

531
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
it.

532
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
I just want to do whatever is the most effective.

533
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,440
So I'm going to look at the defense and whatever they present, you know, to me, I'm going

534
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,360
to take whatever I feel is, is the best approach in, in that moment.

535
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:56,040
And so here it was more of a, how predictable is a team historically.

536
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,760
But again, once you've kind of created this, this, you know, style analysis of the team,

537
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:06,160
the next step is to say, all right, you know, given two teams, how do I expect them to,

538
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,160
to interact?

539
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
Awesome.

540
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,160
Awesome.

541
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,760
Well, what are some, uh, some other interesting projects on your roadmap or to-do lists?

542
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:22,400
How do you see kind of the application of ML and deep learning and, uh, AI evolving

543
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,040
as applied to sports?

544
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,040
Yeah.

545
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:29,800
So the availability of tracking data really kind of, you know, leaves us with, with endless

546
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,800
possibilities.

547
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,000
There's, you know, so much that we can do there to understand, again, the plays that teams

548
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,400
run, um, to identify, to identify plays and then to predict, um, to predict future plays

549
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,400
to do things like, um, right, to, to predict where the players will, will be.

550
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,400
So another paper, you know, that, that our group was involved with through a collaboration,

551
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,000
uh, with, with, uh, Disney, you know, the past couple of years was, um, it's actually

552
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,840
through a, through a collaboration with, um, with Disney research, the, the past two

553
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,280
years, there's been some work at Sloan on, on ghosting.

554
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,640
So originally it was on a software and this past year for, for basketball, where, um,

555
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,560
you know, given the, um, offensive players, like, could you, you know, predict, you know,

556
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,840
where the, the defensive players are?

557
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,520
Um, and so there's, you know, a lot of interesting things there.

558
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,000
We have this huge wealth of data and with, um, you know, the, all the advances in, um,

559
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,920
she learning in particular and deep learning, we can start to do really fine grain analysis

560
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:34,920
and simulation, uh, predicting where the players are, where they'll go, what type of plays

561
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,920
to be run.

562
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,000
Um, there's really just a huge amount of, of different avenues that, that you can go

563
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
there.

564
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,320
And, you know, it's really all, you know, largely driven by the data and having access

565
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:50,480
to the data is really what enables us to ask these, you know, very specific, um, questions.

566
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,960
What if, um, you know, given, given a play and I have a shot, um, you know, what, um,

567
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,440
what if I move players around?

568
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,400
What if a different player took, um, took the shot?

569
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:04,320
Uh, there's a lot of opportunities to do, um, personalized, uh, modeling, which we've,

570
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,320
we've done.

571
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,840
So as I was explaining it, again, like, given, given a certain play, um, you know, what

572
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:14,040
happens if there's a different defender, a different, a different shooter, what happens

573
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,000
if the, the angle or the, the distances are just slightly different, um, how does that

574
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,280
impact the outcome and then building up from single plays to, to more complex, um, kind

575
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,160
of longer scale activities?

576
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:32,400
Uh, you, you mentioned in there how this all kind of revolves around having access to

577
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:40,560
the data, uh, I'm curious in your, what's your sense for how accessible sports applications

578
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,560
of ML are for hobbyists?

579
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:50,800
Like are there, are there freely available, uh, or open source data sets that, um, you're

580
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,320
familiar with that folks could use to play around with, certainly, you know, clearly sports

581
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,400
is a hobby for a lot of people and data science is, uh, you know, a hobby or interest for a

582
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,440
lot of people that folks wanted to combine those two and get started, um, are there ways

583
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:10,840
to, uh, do interesting things or, you know, are all the data sources kind of proprietary

584
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
collected?

585
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,320
You know, I, I think at the past, certainly for my experience, you know, the, you know,

586
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,920
before I was here, you know, a lot of times people looking for sports data were kind of,

587
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,440
um, you know, limited to, to try and discrete things off of websites and that to, to, to

588
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,440
build their models.

589
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,440
Um, you know, we actually, uh, through some of the papers that, um, that, that our group

590
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,200
has published have three data sets out there that, that people can, you know, quest for,

591
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,360
for research purposes, um, you know, one of them is, um, in, in soccer, one of them is

592
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,360
in basketball.

593
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:47,600
Those are both trajectory based, um, related to, to the, uh, to, you know, the trajectory

594
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,280
analysis, um, that we've done.

595
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:56,480
So we have, um, actually through, uh, our website have three, uh, data sets that, that

596
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,960
people can request to do, um, to do, you know, academic research work, you know, hobbyist

597
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,680
type, type analysis, um, two of them are trajectory based, one of them for soccer, one of them

598
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,680
for basketball.

599
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,600
They're probably more complex, you know, it's, it's just literally like x, y position

600
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
of the players.

601
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:18,000
So, um, you don't have to use some sophisticated techniques there to really kind of parse

602
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,280
it and understand it, um, because it's, you know, again, pretty, pretty complex data, um,

603
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,440
but one of the other papers that we had at Sloan, uh, this past year was doing, um, uh, wind

604
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,760
probability analysis.

605
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:35,520
And so there is, uh, data, another data set that we have where, um, you can, you know,

606
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,680
look at that data to, to recreate some of, some of those results.

607
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,880
And probably I'd say like for the, for the general public, that's probably the, um, you

608
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,600
know, most accessible, accessible one, um, you know, that if players wanted to, or that

609
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,840
if people wanted to get their, their hands dirty with, you know, it's really, uh, unique

610
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,000
set of data that, that they can use to answer a bunch of questions.

611
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,760
Well, Jennifer, thanks so much for taking the time to share what you're working on.

612
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:01,240
It sounds like really fun stuff.

613
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,240
