00:00.000 --> 00:15.920
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

00:15.920 --> 00:21.080
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:21.080 --> 00:24.440
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:24.440 --> 00:29.360
How many of you remember my conversation with Josh Bloom from Twimble Talk No. 5?

00:29.360 --> 00:35.560
Josh is the founder and CTO of startup wise.io, which sought to apply AI to the challenge

00:35.560 --> 00:38.040
of providing customer support.

00:38.040 --> 00:46.160
In Josh's words, what we do in our company at wise.io is help customer support agents

00:46.160 --> 00:53.760
become more efficient at their work by suggesting answers of how they can respond to an incoming

00:53.760 --> 01:02.960
increase by automatically triaging incoming increase or tickets, emails, etc. that is getting

01:02.960 --> 01:06.400
them to the right person or the right group who's going to be the best at answering that

01:06.400 --> 01:07.400
question.

01:07.400 --> 01:11.800
And then in some cases, we will automatically respond to incoming increase.

01:11.800 --> 01:18.480
So when you write into e-commerce site and say, my package didn't arrive, there's

01:18.480 --> 01:25.200
a growing chance that us or somebody else may be answering what looks like a bespoke question

01:25.200 --> 01:28.960
of yours with a what looks like a bespoke answer.

01:28.960 --> 01:33.920
Josh shared a ton of insight into how to build AI-powered products in that show, including

01:33.920 --> 01:35.360
gems like this one.

01:35.360 --> 01:43.120
Yeah, so there's definitely this separation of concerns, which again is both an organizational

01:43.120 --> 01:49.800
one and then is also a computational one, to the level where we think we often talk about

01:49.800 --> 01:56.320
what we call the organizational API of who within this stack is the customer of who.

01:56.320 --> 02:01.680
And so for instance, the people who are the sort of core ML and algorithms folks in the

02:01.680 --> 02:08.920
company are working in C++ and surfacing the great results back into Python layer.

02:08.920 --> 02:13.360
Their customer is the data science team.

02:13.360 --> 02:19.280
The customer of the data science team is the people working on our architecture who have

02:19.280 --> 02:25.680
to maintain this scalable robust infrastructure.

02:25.680 --> 02:29.840
And their customers are the people working in the middleware and their customers are the

02:29.840 --> 02:32.680
ones who are in the UI.

02:32.680 --> 02:37.920
And so each of them have a set of contracts of what it is that each part of that stack

02:37.920 --> 02:44.280
is looking for and how, in fact, they're supposed to engage with each other.

02:44.280 --> 02:47.480
Having the data science team be able to push stuff into production without having to be

02:47.480 --> 02:53.400
on the upside of things, nor have to think about the architecture has really freed us

02:53.400 --> 02:57.360
up in great ways, I think, to innovate.

02:57.360 --> 03:01.680
Since my conversation with Josh, he's sold wise.io to GE.

03:01.680 --> 03:07.400
And now he's working to quote unquote AI all the things at that massive company.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.360
So why the trip down memory lane?

03:10.360 --> 03:13.920
Well it's because Josh is just one of the many great speakers who will be joining me

03:13.920 --> 03:21.240
at the future of data summit May 15th and 16th at the Interop ITX conference in Las Vegas.

03:21.240 --> 03:25.440
Josh will be there to elaborate on his experience building AI products and platforms in what

03:25.440 --> 03:29.360
will surely be an amazing presentation.

03:29.360 --> 03:35.040
A few other speakers I've recently added to the agenda include Zachary Heneath, who's

03:35.040 --> 03:39.840
part of a SWAT team of sorts at Capital One that helps various parts of the business

03:39.840 --> 03:44.440
incorporate machine learning and AI into their projects.

03:44.440 --> 03:50.160
Shree Cannon Ramashandran, who will be joining us to talk about marketing in the age of AI

03:50.160 --> 03:55.560
and how her team uses machine learning to drive top line growth at telecom giant level

03:55.560 --> 03:57.440
three communications.

03:57.440 --> 04:02.280
Shree is a big fan of the podcast and I'm really looking forward to her talk.

04:02.280 --> 04:07.560
In Jennifer Prinky, who leads data science and data strategy teams at Walmart Labs, she'll

04:07.560 --> 04:11.840
be speaking on the challenges of integrating data from multiple silos to support machine

04:11.840 --> 04:16.160
learning and AI applications for multi channel retail.

04:16.160 --> 04:20.400
And after their presentations, I'll be leading a Q&A and panel discussion with the three

04:20.400 --> 04:23.480
of them on bringing AI to the enterprise.

04:23.480 --> 04:26.880
This will be the time to get your questions answered.

04:26.880 --> 04:31.280

Okay, now let's get to today's show.

04:50.840 --> 04:56.320
Today we bring you the second of three interviews we did backstage from the NYU Future Labs

04:56.320 --> 04:57.840
AI summit.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.440
This time with Rouchier Puri.

05:00.440 --> 05:05.280
Rouchier is an IBM fellow and the chief architect at IBM Watson.

05:05.280 --> 05:11.600
I caught up with Rouchier after his talk on engineering the future of AI for business.

05:11.600 --> 05:17.400
Our conversation focused on cognition and reasoning and we explored what these concepts represent,

05:17.400 --> 05:23.240
how enterprises really want to consume them and how IBM Watson seeks to deliver them.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.240
Enjoy the show.

05:24.240 --> 05:38.560
All right, everyone, so I'm here with Rouchier Puri, an IBM fellow and chief architect with

05:38.560 --> 05:39.560
IBM Watson.

05:39.560 --> 05:45.880
Rouchier just came off from giving his presentation here at the Future Labs AI summit.

05:45.880 --> 05:46.880
Welcome, Rouchier.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.880
Thank you.

05:47.880 --> 05:53.280
Why don't we start with you giving us a little bit of a little bit of a view into your

05:53.280 --> 05:55.480
background?

05:55.480 --> 06:03.400
So I was background pretty much, I started at the level of all the way down to circuits

06:03.400 --> 06:12.360
and physics and over time I've been just traveling that staircase in terms of abstraction

06:12.360 --> 06:22.960
levels, going up that abstraction level and I'm traveled from circuits to systems to

06:22.960 --> 06:33.400
algorithms in software to cloud to AI for last five years or so and all along I've worked

06:33.400 --> 06:39.640
on algorithms for all kinds of applications including algorithm for designing chips to

06:39.640 --> 06:46.440
algorithm for designing systems to making them smarter to now algorithms for Watson and

06:46.440 --> 06:50.440
my job is to make Watson less shiny more real.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.440
Nice, nice.

06:51.440 --> 06:56.200
How does it give you a unique perspective because in many ways it seems like AI is starting

06:56.200 --> 07:00.280
at that top level of abstraction and then working its way down to the chip level?

07:00.280 --> 07:06.240
Yeah, so that's a very interesting point and I think I would consider myself lucky

07:06.240 --> 07:15.920
to be able to gather the experience I have gathered over past two and a half decades

07:15.920 --> 07:23.200
or so I would say where I started actually down and traveled up where interestingly the

07:23.200 --> 07:30.040
details at the bottom are quite overwhelming and as you move up you are abstracting things

07:30.040 --> 07:36.680
and as you move down people many people shy away from those details so yes it does give

07:36.680 --> 07:44.960
you a unique perspective into a common systems and a software and a cloud view into this

07:44.960 --> 07:50.840
exactly and by systems I just don't mean you know a board or a chip I really mean system

07:50.840 --> 07:56.760
in its entirety which is a you know living, breathing cloud so that's great.

07:56.760 --> 08:00.200
So why don't you tell us a little bit about the presentation you just gave for those

08:00.200 --> 08:03.400
who weren't able to attend what'd you talk about?

08:03.400 --> 08:11.720
So I gave a talk on engineering the future of AI and I basically took the folks through

08:11.720 --> 08:19.800
a journey which is you know what is the what is the art of possible and and if you really

08:19.800 --> 08:28.120
do it right where are we today and I differentiated you know the coolness of AI to what problems

08:28.120 --> 08:34.400
we really need to solve where you know the enterprises are struggling where lot of problems

08:34.400 --> 08:39.680
need to be solved it's not just about finding cats and dogs it's really about you know

08:39.680 --> 08:46.280
finding you know I have a tax problem you know go solve it for me that's popular to beat

08:46.280 --> 08:51.960
up on tax cats and dogs nowadays yeah so you know that's so I took and then I really

08:51.960 --> 08:57.160
talked about you know where the fallacies of some of the current techniques may be and

08:57.160 --> 09:04.840
where we really need to go okay so what in your perspective is are some of those real enterprise

09:04.840 --> 09:09.880
problems what are folks really trying to accomplish with this technology I think folks in the

09:09.880 --> 09:19.480
enterprise first of all they really are trying to solve problems of large data in terms of

09:19.480 --> 09:26.520
you know I've got massive number of documents varying formats of documents varying modalities

09:26.520 --> 09:32.000
of data as well I could have audio data I could have video data I could have data available

09:32.000 --> 09:38.440
in all kind of different formats from PDFs to to docs to everything else actually that's

09:38.440 --> 09:45.480
available including you know scan jpeg images of you know documents and other things I may

09:45.480 --> 09:52.640
be scanning go address it for me and then to be able to have what I call conversational

09:52.640 --> 09:59.160
discovery I call that whole domain what what I would say conversational discovery which

09:59.160 --> 10:04.960
means what don't just discover things for me and I talked about this in the in the presentation

10:04.960 --> 10:11.640
I just gave as well cognition is not just about I ask you a question and then you give me

10:11.640 --> 10:16.680
an answer if you knew the answer you give me an answer that's called search actually cognition

10:16.680 --> 10:22.840
is more about I ask you a question you actually come back and say oh I figured out five

10:22.840 --> 10:27.640
pieces of that puzzle I don't know five pieces of the puzzle that I really need to answer

10:27.640 --> 10:32.520
that question I'm gonna summarize that in the form of a question back to you and trying

10:32.520 --> 10:37.240
to get the answer out of you so that you can guide me this that's really what cognition

10:37.240 --> 10:41.600
is about it's not about you know okay how many you know above what limit I need to pay

10:41.600 --> 10:46.200
what tax yeah it's there in the document it's really about you know finding the pieces

10:46.200 --> 10:51.920
of puzzle and posing it back to me in a way and getting a conversation getting me engaged

10:51.920 --> 10:57.040
in a conversation so that you can get the answer back that's what I call so discovery

10:57.040 --> 11:03.160
is a is a enterprise application and then conversational discovery make it more consumerized

11:03.160 --> 11:11.080
actually so it's really about amalgamation of consumers and enterprises consumer experience

11:11.080 --> 11:17.080
with enterprise problems interesting I like the way you put that conversational discovery

11:17.080 --> 11:25.840
I have been talking to people and asking people about what I call intelligence intelligence

11:25.840 --> 11:31.120
design like how do we design experiences in light of artificial intelligence and one

11:31.120 --> 11:37.360
thing that strikes me is that it's it needs to be at least very interdisciplinary and so

11:37.360 --> 11:43.760
when you talk about conversational discovery it makes me think that we've accomplished

11:43.760 --> 11:50.840
a lot in terms of how do we make information and data discoverable interactively in the

11:50.840 --> 11:56.120
business intelligence world like ad hoc you know query discovery things like that are you

11:56.120 --> 12:01.320
are you at IBM or do you see any place people that are working to pull all these threads

12:01.320 --> 12:10.480
together to make conversational discovery possible yes so we've got actually a application

12:10.480 --> 12:18.160
we've hold a bunch of actually APIs available for developers to go and write their applications

12:18.160 --> 12:25.840
against discoveries one of the more fundamental APIs we have available we classify our APIs

12:25.840 --> 12:31.560
into three categories one is conversation based one is discovery based and the third one

12:31.560 --> 12:37.640
is what I call signal actually which is in our speech text all this all this stuff actually

12:37.640 --> 12:44.480
and images is part of it as well and yes we see we at Watson have been working very

12:44.480 --> 12:53.040
hard towards bringing all these together conversation along with speech along with discovery with

12:53.040 --> 12:57.600
reasoning actually as well so it's not about just you know information retrieval it's not

12:57.600 --> 13:03.680
information retrieval it's about reasoning also which is where conversational discovery with

13:03.680 --> 13:09.760
natural speech becomes very powerful that's exactly what we've been working towards we've got

13:09.760 --> 13:14.960
pieces of it already there out in the marketplace like discoveries there in the marketplace and

13:14.960 --> 13:20.320
other things we are working towards as we bring more and more reasoning techniques into discovery

13:20.320 --> 13:24.720
and conversation on top of it reasoning is a very high level concept how do you make that more

13:24.720 --> 13:31.040
concrete for people what actually are you doing that you classify as reasoning so I'll let me

13:31.040 --> 13:38.720
let me give an example of reasoning actually so obviously for for academic folks there are three

13:38.720 --> 13:43.280
kinds of reasoning abductive inductive and you know I'm not going to bore you with that that

13:43.280 --> 13:50.720
normal creature but but let's assume for the time being actually that that you're trying to

13:52.320 --> 13:58.400
again I'm gonna go back to the example I gave I've got five pieces of the puzzle figuring out

13:58.400 --> 14:03.280
there are 10 pieces of the puzzle itself is reasoning right you asked me a question figuring out

14:03.280 --> 14:09.040
10 pieces of the puzzle itself is reasoning figuring out I've got five of them figured out that's

14:09.040 --> 14:17.840
another level of reasoning and then combining the five unknowns into a summarization and posing

14:17.840 --> 14:24.800
that question back is actually part of summarization not necessarily reasoning and then when you pose

14:24.800 --> 14:32.000
a question back to me going and figuring out that those satisfy that five pieces or not the answer

14:32.000 --> 14:39.840
you gave back to me that is reasoning as well actually okay um and then there is obviously you know

14:39.840 --> 14:46.240
mathematical reasoning that we can have right as well so uh so as you so you primarily

14:46.240 --> 14:55.280
delivering uh Watson via API is presumably this reasoning uh element as well what is the API

14:55.280 --> 15:00.800
look like you not just have some corpus of data and say okay go reason and tell me back things

15:00.800 --> 15:07.760
here are you directing it what is what's the yeah so reasoning is really built as as part of many

15:07.760 --> 15:15.200
of the API internally itself um so for example you know discovery and and and knowledge graph as we

15:15.200 --> 15:22.000
move forward and uh querying on knowledge graphs and reasoning on knowledge graphs as well

15:22.000 --> 15:28.960
is delivered as as part of the capability of discovery okay it's not that we are exposing reasoning

15:28.960 --> 15:35.600
in its abstract form it's integrated as part of the API is that we are delivering uh specifically

15:35.600 --> 15:41.600
in discoveries specifically in things like uh compare and comply I showed examples of obligations

15:41.600 --> 15:48.720
and controls uh that's reasoning itself as well um figuring out what are my obligations may not be

15:48.720 --> 15:55.280
uh be be reasoning however figuring out what obligations and what what controls map with each other

15:55.280 --> 15:59.840
is actually certainly form of reasoning as well so these are all integrated together and we are

15:59.840 --> 16:06.320
bringing it out as you know very consumable APIs which underneath actually use many reasoning techniques

16:06.320 --> 16:13.920
as we move forward okay and do you think uh reasoning as a service is a is a worthwhile goal is

16:13.920 --> 16:21.200
that separate and distinct in your mind from uh AGI uh as it may be an intermediate step even or

16:21.200 --> 16:28.560
is that not really the the direction you're headed so so at least in terms of so certainly

16:28.560 --> 16:35.280
and I'm gonna take just a step back just for a minute and and and and we we are working towards

16:35.280 --> 16:41.120
bringing out learning as a service actually so whether it is deep learning on machine learning

16:41.120 --> 16:47.200
Watson machine learning is already available actually on our on our APIs so learning as a service

16:47.200 --> 16:53.680
and it's it's certainly I mean I could argue it's certainly we are watching the consumer behavior

16:53.680 --> 17:02.400
very very closely actually however um it really will depend on it's hard for me to see right now

17:02.400 --> 17:07.360
whether somebody will consume reasoning in abstraction uh-huh it's very hard to figure out actually

17:07.360 --> 17:13.680
and it's it's really hard for me to pinpoint that if that is what will that be reason in abstraction

17:13.680 --> 17:19.600
so I would say currently know however you know this area is evolving very fast and we are keeping

17:19.600 --> 17:26.000
our mind open with respect to if something's emerged um people they you know people are actually

17:26.000 --> 17:32.000
obviously we are working on uh uh data science uh workbench as well that we are exposing

17:32.000 --> 17:37.120
and part of those algorithms we can expose reasoning algorithms we can expose to so obviously

17:37.120 --> 17:43.040
for data scientists we can have capabilities which get exposed directly in terms of hey I want

17:43.040 --> 17:49.200
that reasoning algorithm and that reasoning algorithm but to me other than for for you know PhDs

17:49.200 --> 17:55.920
in this area it's hard for me to see how consumers actually and by consumers I really mean enterprise

17:55.920 --> 18:02.080
consumers as well how they just abstractly consume reasoning but again it's a fast moving area so

18:02.080 --> 18:12.960
so if you were to to um lay out you know one two three general directions for the machine learning

18:12.960 --> 18:20.240
as a service API's you know where they headed what should we expect to see from those that

18:20.240 --> 18:27.440
that you offer as well as the field as a whole so machine learning as a service specifically so

18:27.440 --> 18:32.800
many things that are available in the marketplace today is what I call AMIs actually you know you

18:32.800 --> 18:38.640
can go to Amazon or Google and you can download something and you know you can spin up a VM and go

18:38.640 --> 18:44.240
install it and play to your hearts content however to me where things are really headed is

18:45.280 --> 18:50.880
you bring me your data mm-hmm you don't have to tell me whether you want to choose cafe or

18:50.880 --> 18:58.000
tensor flow or you know bring me your data by the way data is good right in this area data is

18:58.000 --> 19:04.080
gold if I gave you my data I gave you my life effectively and I've given you my life already you

19:04.080 --> 19:08.720
guide me regarding don't ask me what neural network you want I don't know the head and tail of

19:08.720 --> 19:14.160
neural network as a consumer neither do I want to know I run my business don't ask me what kind of

19:14.160 --> 19:19.440
neural network would you like you would you like two GPUs or four GPUs is what do I care go go figure

19:19.440 --> 19:26.080
it out and so it really is heading for what I would call machine learning for machine learning

19:27.120 --> 19:32.960
go figure out on top of machine learning a entire layer which is smart enough

19:32.960 --> 19:38.880
which takes data right and then you know figures everything out and gives me that insight back

19:38.880 --> 19:43.760
that's where things are heading don't ask me do you want to use logistic regression or naive

19:43.760 --> 19:49.520
base right do I care really right I'll say huh what did you ask me right that's where things are

19:49.520 --> 19:55.840
heading which is more on AI for AI or machine learning for machine learning because the you

19:55.840 --> 20:01.760
know the lower layer can get complex actually and you should not be exposing that to the to the end

20:01.760 --> 20:07.760
consumers obviously there is you know a narrow percentage of people let's say five percent or so

20:07.760 --> 20:13.600
who are PITs in deep in either deep learning or data science area who do want to actually thinker

20:13.600 --> 20:18.960
with that but majority of the people they really don't want to they want to actually give you the

20:18.960 --> 20:23.680
data and really get insights out of it you need to make it seamless for them you really need

20:23.680 --> 20:28.960
even need to tell them you know I've got GPUs yeah so if it helps them go use it if it doesn't

20:28.960 --> 20:37.840
don't use it are you getting any pushback in fact from people who don't want to give you the data

20:37.840 --> 20:44.880
actually it's certainly as I as I described we've got three levels of of data sources actually

20:44.880 --> 20:51.280
I would say and where we are enriching that data and deriving insights out of that public domain

20:51.280 --> 20:58.960
private and we seamlessly sort of we were cross that public being I already talked about which is

20:58.960 --> 21:04.240
you know Wikipedia kind of data domain being you are in finance industry or insurance industry

21:04.240 --> 21:08.800
you got knowledge base for that and then private is your data right which we don't share with

21:08.800 --> 21:15.680
anybody neither do we share the insights of that with anybody as well and as we explain in fact

21:15.680 --> 21:24.000
one of our strengths at IBM Watson is really are are specifically this clarity on data

21:24.000 --> 21:29.920
we will not use your data specifically to go and benefit others your data your data you hold the

21:29.920 --> 21:36.720
insights for that and and our CEO and and David Kenny who's the the senior VP of Watson has been

21:36.720 --> 21:43.520
very explicit in saying this I would say one of our our differentiators actually at Watson

21:43.520 --> 21:50.400
is specifically the clarity of the data policy okay and specifically the we weven get cross

21:50.400 --> 21:57.040
this seamlessly with Watson okay great so the wrap things up do you have maybe three takeaways

21:57.040 --> 22:01.520
from your presentation that you would like to lead folks with or was were there were there any

22:03.280 --> 22:11.680
calls to action that you laid out so I would really say you know first of all these are really

22:11.680 --> 22:19.120
interesting times the AI has made tremendous progress in in last you know decade or so more

22:19.120 --> 22:26.480
recently in the last five years and and businesses are hungry for how to really consume this this

22:26.480 --> 22:33.680
wave of of breakthroughs that we've been actually getting the the problem is really not about

22:34.640 --> 22:40.800
obviously being able to search but be able to reason over the data as well build models and

22:40.800 --> 22:48.400
make it easy to consume actually and to get to the next level of cognition which I call actually

22:48.400 --> 22:54.880
conversational discovery with with reasoning or interaction with insight there many names of it

22:54.880 --> 23:00.320
but really I think from it it's it's very interesting times for business businesses because

23:01.760 --> 23:08.160
at the lower layers the complexity is quite large you need to be able to to abstract that complexity

23:08.160 --> 23:14.320
from the users and be able to give them insights with they are giving you the data and and that's

23:14.320 --> 23:19.120
all they need to give you you should actually you know really insulate this from them and be able

23:19.120 --> 23:25.760
to give them the the benefit of of conversational discovery as we move forward so great well great

23:25.760 --> 23:32.000
thank you very much for being on the show was great to meet you and to get your perspectives on

23:32.000 --> 23:42.320
