Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

00:16.320 --> 00:21.480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:21.480 --> 00:32.440
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:32.440 --> 00:37.840
This week we are super excited to celebrate the second anniversary of our favorite machine

00:37.840 --> 00:40.280
learning and AI podcast.

00:40.280 --> 00:44.640
With your help, we've hit a bunch of exciting milestones over the past year, including

00:44.640 --> 00:50.480
surpassing 2 million plays, growing the meetup to nearly 800 members, and bringing you

00:50.480 --> 00:54.480
over 115 interviews.

00:54.480 --> 00:56.680
What an amazing ride.

00:56.680 --> 01:00.880
To celebrate the anniversary, we'd like to hear from you about the ways the podcast

01:00.880 --> 01:05.600
has helped you or your business, how it's enabled you to find or connect to resources

01:05.600 --> 01:11.440
you've found valuable, or how it's educated you about new and interesting topics.

01:11.440 --> 01:16.800
Submit your written or audio comments via the anniversary page we've set up at twimble.ai

01:16.800 --> 01:19.640
slash 2av.

01:19.640 --> 01:24.360
With your permission, we'll be including a few of your stories in a special podcast episode

01:24.360 --> 01:29.840
coming soon, celebrating the twimble community.

01:29.840 --> 01:35.640
In this episode, I'm joined by legendary chess champion, author, and fellow at the Oxford

01:35.640 --> 01:39.320
Martin School, Gary Kasparov.

01:39.320 --> 01:44.280
Gary and I sat down after his keynote at the Figure 8 Train AI Conference in San Francisco

01:44.280 --> 01:45.920
last week.

01:45.920 --> 01:50.400
Gary and I discussed his bouts with the chess playing computer deep blue, which became

01:50.400 --> 01:56.360
the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in their 1997 rematch, and

01:56.360 --> 02:01.600
how that experience has helped shape his thinking on artificially intelligent systems.

02:01.600 --> 02:06.440
We explore his perspective on the evolution of AI, the ways in which chess and deep blue

02:06.440 --> 02:14.160
differ from go and alpha go, and the significance of deep minds latest creation alpha go zero.

02:14.160 --> 02:19.120
We also talk through his views on the relationship between humans and machines and how he expects

02:19.120 --> 02:22.440
it to change over time.

02:22.440 --> 02:26.760
Before we jump in, I'd like to send a shout out to our friends over at Figure 8 for their

02:26.760 --> 02:32.200
continued support of the show and their sponsorship of this week's series, which all took place

02:32.200 --> 02:34.520
at train AI.

02:34.520 --> 02:40.320
Figure 8 is the essential human and loop AI platform for data science and machine learning teams.

02:40.320 --> 02:45.840
To figure eight software platform trains, tests and tunes, machine learning models to

02:45.840 --> 02:54.880
make AI work in the real world, learn more at www.figure-8.com.

02:54.880 --> 02:59.680
Just a reminder, this episode was recorded live on site, so there's some unavoidable

02:59.680 --> 03:01.160
background noise.

03:01.160 --> 03:04.760
And now on to the show.

03:04.760 --> 03:10.520
All right, everyone, I am here with Gary Kasparov.

03:10.520 --> 03:16.520
Gary is chairman of the Human Rights Foundation, author of Winters Coming and Deep Thinking, a

03:16.520 --> 03:22.520
visiting fellow at Oxford Martin School, and of course, the 13th world chess champion.

03:22.520 --> 03:25.040
Gary, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

03:25.040 --> 03:26.880
Thanks for having me here.

03:26.880 --> 03:27.880
Absolutely.

03:27.880 --> 03:33.720
So, tomorrow, May 11th is a significant day for you.

03:33.720 --> 03:38.480
For those that are not familiar with your story, maybe we can start out by having you tell

03:38.480 --> 03:44.160
us a little bit about the significance of that day and kind of your path leading up to

03:44.160 --> 03:45.160
it.

03:45.160 --> 03:50.760
I think it was a significant day for computer science more than chess.

03:50.760 --> 03:58.200
And now, 21 years later, so I can think about it, I can discuss it without the same anxiety

03:58.200 --> 04:04.480
and even anger that I had at the time when I faced the blue for the second match.

04:04.480 --> 04:10.280
I'll remind people, it was the second match because I won the first one in 1996.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.600
And I lost this match.

04:11.600 --> 04:17.280
And I heard even today at the conference here in San Francisco about many people talking

04:17.280 --> 04:25.720
about moment of inspiration, not only within IBM, rank and files, but beyond that.

04:25.720 --> 04:31.640
People saw the great accomplishments for machine eventually prevailing in the game of

04:31.640 --> 04:32.640
chess.

04:32.640 --> 04:39.800
It's in the game that always was viewed as the sort of pinnacle of human intelligence.

04:39.800 --> 04:48.240
And at my presentation at train conference, I gave a little bit of a background of this

04:48.240 --> 04:58.720
quest for holy grail in chess, beating chess wall champion was an ultimate goal for the

04:58.720 --> 05:00.720
founding fathers of computer science.

05:00.720 --> 05:07.280
They believed that would be the moment of revelation, the dawn of artificial intelligence.

05:07.280 --> 05:12.000
And I have to say that somehow they were wrong.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
How's that?

05:13.000 --> 05:17.160
Because they expect it and we can hardly blame them for making this mistake.

05:17.160 --> 05:22.960
Because these great, great men, the great minds, Alan Turing, Claude Shannon, Norbert

05:22.960 --> 05:29.240
Wiener, they couldn't imagine the amount of brute force that was, that is, at our disposal

05:29.240 --> 05:36.040
now, or even was it in 1997, they believed that for machines to make any significant progress

05:36.040 --> 05:42.440
in conquering the human domain of cognition, machines will have to be intelligent.

05:42.440 --> 05:46.040
It's more like emulating human thinking.

05:46.040 --> 05:51.280
And the brute force that IBM could build into the blue to throw into the game of chess

05:51.280 --> 05:57.320
in 1997 proved to be enough to play at the top level.

05:57.320 --> 06:03.080
I think objectively speaking, when you look at the games we played in 1997, the blue was

06:03.080 --> 06:04.080
not unbeatable.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.840
It was probably even weaker objectively than I was at that time.

06:07.840 --> 06:11.720
But this is a mistake many people made and still making.

06:11.720 --> 06:16.760
And I think that for machine to dominate any game, it has to be perfect, no, it has to

06:16.760 --> 06:17.760
be better.

06:17.760 --> 06:18.760
Right.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.560
Simply better, which means making less mistakes than humans.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.200
And humans are pushed making mistakes.

06:24.200 --> 06:30.360
Even the best humans, the world champions, the top players, we are vulnerable to all sorts

06:30.360 --> 06:32.840
of factors, psychological pressure.

06:32.840 --> 06:37.640
And the moment we make mistakes, we expose ourselves because machines, let's say they

06:37.640 --> 06:39.960
have steady hand.

06:39.960 --> 06:46.120
They're getting faster and faster and with this enormous amount of brute force and speed,

06:46.120 --> 06:51.040
they already created a challenge that was very hard for humans to deal with.

06:51.040 --> 06:55.840
And this is a pattern that we could observe in any activity.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.120
First we think it's impossible.

06:58.120 --> 07:03.000
Then machines are playing with us, competing with us, but they're laughingly weak.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.040
Then it's a very narrow window of competition.

07:05.040 --> 07:08.560
In chess it was from 1995 to roughly 2005.

07:08.560 --> 07:12.600
And then machines are superior forever after.

07:12.600 --> 07:18.560
You made the point earlier that people put a lot of significance on that date in 1997,

07:18.560 --> 07:21.640
but to you, the turning point was earlier.

07:21.640 --> 07:28.400
Yeah, it was earlier because it's, yeah, if we, if we want to be objective and scientific,

07:28.400 --> 07:35.000
we should look at game one of our match with the blue in Philadelphia a year early in 1996,

07:35.000 --> 07:38.520
I won the match, as I mentioned, but I lost game one.

07:38.520 --> 07:44.640
And the fact is that machine could win one game on the normal tournament conditions against

07:44.640 --> 07:48.680
current world champion, men that the rest won the better of time.

07:48.680 --> 07:52.840
It could take a year, two, three, but, but it was already the writing on the wall with

07:52.840 --> 07:56.800
capital letters, the boarding letters, which you thought it would take longer than it did.

07:56.800 --> 08:01.880
I thought it would take longer, you know, I think I could have played better.

08:01.880 --> 08:09.040
And after match with the blue, I played two other matches with other programs, chess engines,

08:09.040 --> 08:15.280
deep freights and deep junior, one German program, one Israeli program, both matched in 2003,

08:15.280 --> 08:16.960
both ended in a tie.

08:16.960 --> 08:21.360
Again, objectively, these programs were as good as the blue, maybe even stronger, though

08:21.360 --> 08:25.080
they didn't have the same computing power behind them.

08:25.080 --> 08:29.440
But as I said, it was just, you know, protracted agony.

08:29.440 --> 08:37.280
In 2005, it became apparent that human machine competition was over.

08:37.280 --> 08:42.400
My successor, Vladimir Kramnik, who was a world champion, played two matches with deep

08:42.400 --> 08:43.400
freights.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.400
He tied one.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.680
He lost the second one down the few other matches by prominent players.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.760
And it was already one sided.

08:49.760 --> 08:56.480
And it proved my point that I made immediately after 1997 match that we had to look already

08:56.480 --> 09:04.880
beyond this competition for an opportunity to find a new algorithm of humans and machines

09:04.880 --> 09:06.640
working together.

09:06.640 --> 09:14.760
Because in chess, we could actually make these experiments, bringing humans' creativity,

09:14.760 --> 09:20.640
humans' fantasy, humans' imagination, and to match it with machines' brute force

09:20.640 --> 09:22.160
of calculation and memory.

09:22.160 --> 09:27.440
So what does that actually mean in the context of chess, the two humans and machines tend

09:27.440 --> 09:29.720
to operate at vastly different speeds?

09:29.720 --> 09:35.880
No, no, but it's still, it's about your ability to get the best out of this combination.

09:35.880 --> 09:41.560
Because you're going to have two players of roughly even strengths operating with the

09:41.560 --> 09:47.000
same kind of hardware, even the same software, and you will end up with very different

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
results.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.080
Because the trick is, and that's something that I think makes chess quite unique, testing

09:52.080 --> 10:00.080
ground for all these scientific discoveries, that each machine requires, call it special

10:00.080 --> 10:01.080
treatment.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.240
Because no machine goes out of a sudden perfection.

10:03.240 --> 10:08.120
And the human's role is to compensate for machines' deficiencies.

10:08.120 --> 10:14.040
So to actually find exactly what is machine weakness and how we can use our human qualities

10:14.040 --> 10:23.640
to cover it, to make sure that these weaknesses will not cause significant damage during the

10:23.640 --> 10:24.800
game.

10:24.800 --> 10:32.840
And the trick is that to succeed in playing in this team, human plus machine, you don't

10:32.840 --> 10:36.840
need the strongest human and all the fastest machine.

10:36.840 --> 10:40.680
You have to make sure that the interface is the most effective.

10:40.680 --> 10:47.080
So that's why relatively weak human, with average computer, but superior interface, will

10:47.080 --> 10:52.640
be dominant in the game of chess against stronger human player, faster machine, with inferior

10:52.640 --> 10:53.640
interface.

10:53.640 --> 10:59.920
Well, I'd like to come back to this point of the human machine interface in chess and

10:59.920 --> 11:03.080
understanding the machine's weaknesses.

11:03.080 --> 11:07.920
But before we do that, just to contextualize, deep blue, you'd like to refer to it as a

11:07.920 --> 11:11.040
10 million dollar calculator or alarm clock or something.

11:11.040 --> 11:13.040
That was relative to where we are.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.280
It's the, I mean, deep blue would have never passed during tests.

11:16.280 --> 11:17.280
Right.

11:17.280 --> 11:18.800
But that's again, that's so what?

11:18.800 --> 11:26.000
So this is, we don't realize how much help we receive from what Claude Shannon described

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
as type A machines.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.360
It's brute force executing human instructions and tremendous speed.

11:32.360 --> 11:42.360
So deep blue just proved that with massive processing power behind the program, you could

11:42.360 --> 11:46.120
perform better than humans in the field of cognition.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.200
Again, I want to emphasize it.

11:48.200 --> 11:51.880
I think it's very important for people to realize it's not about solving the game.

11:51.880 --> 11:53.200
It's about winning the game.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.040
It's not about playing perfect game.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.920
It's about playing better.

11:56.920 --> 12:00.040
The same goes for driver's cars now.

12:00.040 --> 12:03.040
People think, oh, yes, it's not safe.

12:03.040 --> 12:04.600
Nobody tells you to be safe.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.600
It will be safer.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.720
Again, it's all about percentage.

12:07.720 --> 12:13.600
So machines will never, will never be formed at the 100% precision.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.920
But they will do step by step.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.160
They will do things better, more effective than humans.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.680
And that's all we have to look for.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.480
It's just about improvements.

12:22.480 --> 12:29.760
It's about incremental improvements that we're combined are just securing our progress.

12:29.760 --> 12:34.920
So can you elaborate on the distinction between those two at any game of chess when the

12:34.920 --> 12:37.040
human makes a move?

12:37.040 --> 12:42.120
If the machine is doing a brute force analysis of all the possible, are they doing all

12:42.120 --> 12:43.120
the possible?

12:43.120 --> 12:44.120
No, it's impossible.

12:44.120 --> 12:48.440
All the possible moves because according to what Claude Shannon, the number of legal

12:48.440 --> 12:52.000
moves in the game of chess is 10 to the 45th power.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.000
Sure.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
It's number.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.000
It's insane number.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.000
It just doesn't exist.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.520
It exists on paper.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.360
No way machine can make calculate all the moves.

13:00.360 --> 13:09.560
So at certain point, you need human intervention or to be more precise, humans guidance to help

13:09.560 --> 13:13.400
to tweak a little bit the way machine is heading for.

13:13.400 --> 13:17.960
And was that, how was that present in the match with deep blue?

13:17.960 --> 13:19.760
No, the blue was me versus machine.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.320
It was human versus machine.

13:21.320 --> 13:26.520
So now when I leaking my wounds, I just realized that that was time to think about

13:26.520 --> 13:30.320
the way for us to work together.

13:30.320 --> 13:34.400
Though I still was ready to compete and I wanted to play the rematch with deep blue.

13:34.400 --> 13:39.720
And as I said, deep blue, they're not being intelligent, denied me the rematch because

13:39.720 --> 13:45.880
I think IBM recognized that the match, the match in 1998, I think I had a very good

13:45.880 --> 13:51.640
chance of winning because I could be better prepared and there's nothing IBM could gain

13:51.640 --> 13:52.640
out of this match.

13:52.640 --> 13:57.240
It was bad for science, they decided not to play the third match, the rubber match because

13:57.240 --> 14:01.640
I won the first one, they won the second, but it was good from the business perspectives.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.440
And the IBM executives, they looked at the stock value.

14:04.440 --> 14:11.000
So again, I can't complain, so as people said, okay, you made two mistakes, Gary, it's

14:11.000 --> 14:12.000
not about chess.

14:12.000 --> 14:20.520
A, you have not secured the next match, B, you have not secured stock options.

14:20.520 --> 14:24.360
So how would you have prepared for that match differently?

14:24.360 --> 14:29.200
I would have taken the blue more seriously because I didn't expect the progress they made

14:29.200 --> 14:31.200
after the first match.

14:31.200 --> 14:36.880
And also I would probably demand more transparency with the way the blue operated.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.800
So just to understand more, because we needed some information about the blue.

14:39.800 --> 14:44.040
I mean, for instance, one of the biggest mistakes I made preparing for the second match is

14:44.040 --> 14:50.440
not reading the contract, actually not reading the fine print because to prepare you need

14:50.440 --> 14:55.040
games of your opponent, you have to know how your opponent thinks.

14:55.040 --> 14:59.880
If it's computed, it could even more important because machines are flexible than humans.

14:59.880 --> 15:06.560
So by having some games, access to some games, you can understand how machine could make

15:06.560 --> 15:12.000
decisions in some types of positions.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.200
After the first match, I said I would need the blue games and they said absolutely.

15:16.200 --> 15:21.760
And the contract said stipulated games will be provided and the fine print said only

15:21.760 --> 15:23.600
played an official tournament.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.280
And of course, the blue played only left.

15:25.280 --> 15:29.560
So one of the things I would have demanded and they knew it, it's to have access to all

15:29.560 --> 15:33.440
the blue games, to understand how they make certain improvements.

15:33.440 --> 15:39.600
Then I would definitely insist on certain limitations of making changes for the programs during

15:39.600 --> 15:40.600
the match.

15:40.600 --> 15:46.240
I remember that it would have not secured my victory, but it definitely would put more

15:46.240 --> 15:50.720
pressure on them because also I would start thinking about my preparation opening.

15:50.720 --> 15:57.440
So when you lose, it's kind of a lot of time thinking about it.

15:57.440 --> 16:00.040
You know that you have to make certain improvements.

16:00.040 --> 16:05.800
And I was already contemplating what new things I could bring in.

16:05.800 --> 16:09.120
And again, as I said, objectively, I was still stronger at that time.

16:09.120 --> 16:13.880
And all I needed is just to spend maybe a couple of months confiding on this match, just

16:13.880 --> 16:16.240
getting stronger physically, mentally.

16:16.240 --> 16:21.680
So it would be a big challenge for IBM, they just walked away.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.200
So deep blue wasn't even AI.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.000
No, absolutely not.

16:27.000 --> 16:33.080
That's what's annoying is that it was a great accomplishment, but it was type A machine,

16:33.080 --> 16:34.920
a brute force.

16:34.920 --> 16:39.160
You can even say that deep blue demonstrated the limitations of brute force.

16:39.160 --> 16:47.960
So as the, it's, it's what you can do, I mean, it's the, your improvement is still,

16:47.960 --> 16:51.080
would be based on human contribution.

16:51.080 --> 16:57.000
So it's all about, you know, human help that is needed to program the machines.

16:57.000 --> 17:01.960
We still have very strong powerful machines now with this, that you can download just

17:01.960 --> 17:04.880
engines on your, on your software.

17:04.880 --> 17:08.440
But it's, you know, you don't need these massive power processing power.

17:08.440 --> 17:11.560
So they're much stronger than the blue, much, much stronger.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.760
And it's just a, they operate on your laptop.

17:13.760 --> 17:14.760
Yeah.

17:14.760 --> 17:19.920
So it's, but still, you know, it's, it's, it's a moment that, you know, it was undeniable

17:19.920 --> 17:22.400
moment of inspiration.

17:22.400 --> 17:28.840
And though I was on, on the losing side, so I was a victim, but, you know, why I could

17:28.840 --> 17:37.080
feel not proud, but more comfortable these days, thinking that, you know, somehow by sacrificing

17:37.080 --> 17:38.080
myself.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.800
So I, I helped you in progress.

17:40.800 --> 17:44.760
Tell us a little bit about how computer chess has evolved since then.

17:44.760 --> 17:51.440
Oh, as I said, we have very strong chess engines these days, that are far superior to any

17:51.440 --> 17:58.880
humans, for those who are familiar with, with chess, Commodore, Stockfish, Houdini, so just

17:58.880 --> 18:04.720
those, those programs that are so much stronger than the current world champion, Magnus Carlson,

18:04.720 --> 18:09.160
that the gap between them is about the same as between Magnus Carlson and the decent player

18:09.160 --> 18:11.240
from open international tournaments.

18:11.240 --> 18:17.840
And these are also, these are all still type A types of, you know, type A machines, they

18:17.840 --> 18:22.400
are just, you know, they're being equipped with more knowledge.

18:22.400 --> 18:26.720
So it's, it's the, it's the software, so it's sophisticated day.

18:26.720 --> 18:30.440
The blue could be up to two, up to 200 million positions per second.

18:30.440 --> 18:35.760
These machines would be, I would say, make six, seven, eight million positions per second,

18:35.760 --> 18:41.080
but it's more than enough because they, they search mechanisms far more sophisticated.

18:41.080 --> 18:45.200
So they just, you know, and they do it better, but it's, but it's still, it's the, it's,

18:45.200 --> 18:48.160
it's, you call it data crunching, yeah, yeah.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.160
Yeah.

18:49.160 --> 18:55.520
Now people said that it's the, with machines being so strong, chess would face extinction.

18:55.520 --> 18:59.360
To the contrary, chess is more popular today because it's interesting paradox.

18:59.360 --> 19:04.880
On one side, you have machines that could be any humans, but on the other side, it took

19:04.880 --> 19:10.160
away the curtain of mystery from the game of chess because when I played an hydraulic

19:10.160 --> 19:15.760
carpal for the World Championship matches, even the grandmaster, grandmasters that were

19:15.760 --> 19:20.400
analyzing games in the press center and making commentaries on television, they were very

19:20.400 --> 19:22.160
shy of criticizing our game.

19:22.160 --> 19:27.120
Even if we made mistakes, yes, but it's world champion and the challenger.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.320
How can you say something negative?

19:29.320 --> 19:30.960
You're not sure.

19:30.960 --> 19:36.120
Today, every amateur equipped with a computer could see that Magnus calls him at a blender

19:36.120 --> 19:37.880
because machine is screaming.

19:37.880 --> 19:44.160
So now, on one side is annoying because I mean, following these games on the internet and

19:44.160 --> 19:49.440
seeing how this bunch of amateurs are just laughing at Magnus Carlson makes me feel angry.

19:49.440 --> 19:51.720
But on the other side, don't read the comments.

19:51.720 --> 19:55.240
But on the other side, he brings poor people in because they can understand it.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.240
Makes it more accessible.

19:56.240 --> 19:59.480
Plus they can, you know, they can look at the games, they can analyze the games, they

19:59.480 --> 20:00.480
can make preparation.

20:00.480 --> 20:05.440
So I think machines played a positive role overall when you look at this overall contribution

20:05.440 --> 20:12.560
by making chess more attractive to millions and millions and millions of fans that before

20:12.560 --> 20:19.600
fell inferior to the top players, they couldn't be part of this process.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.960
So they were passive watchers.

20:21.960 --> 20:25.040
Now they feel they are part of this whole process.

20:25.040 --> 20:31.080
And we thought that in chess, you know, we would see this gradual development with this

20:31.080 --> 20:33.120
type A machines.

20:33.120 --> 20:40.480
And the conventional wisdom was that stronger machines are dollar the game is because machines

20:40.480 --> 20:45.880
will see the combinations when advance and there will be less tactics and it's more

20:45.880 --> 20:50.040
position maneuvering and it's games will be not as exciting.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.880
Typically the games played between strongest type A engines.

20:53.880 --> 20:59.560
They are, I would say, 70, 75, 80 moves long while the human game is about 80 moves.

20:59.560 --> 21:05.480
So you can see it's more precise but less exciting.

21:05.480 --> 21:08.840
Now everything has changed with the appearance of alpha zero.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.640
That's the, that's a very new type of machine.

21:11.640 --> 21:18.760
By the way, I call it here type C and ironically, as we can say that type B machines contrary

21:18.760 --> 21:23.120
to the expectations of founding fathers never succeeded in chess.

21:23.120 --> 21:26.440
Actually they just, you know, we didn't want to have type B machines.

21:26.440 --> 21:31.320
So it's this because the idea of emulating human thinking but still operating with human

21:31.320 --> 21:33.440
knowledge didn't work out.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.000
We don't even really know what it means.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.000
Exactly.

21:36.000 --> 21:41.080
But it's the, I think it's again, it's important psychological contradiction in our mind.

21:41.080 --> 21:45.360
So we want machines to create a miracle but also want to understand how is the miracle

21:45.360 --> 21:46.360
we can create.

21:46.360 --> 21:52.280
I always say that the aeroplanes flying faster than any bird without flapping their wings.

21:52.280 --> 21:59.320
Deep blue, one, you know, one of the match against world champion out before me without

21:59.320 --> 22:02.680
thinking me because it's just the machines do it in a different way.

22:02.680 --> 22:06.040
Now with deep blue, you could spend if you're patient.

22:06.040 --> 22:12.120
You could spend a year or so looking at all the logs, you know, going deep, deep down

22:12.120 --> 22:15.240
to find out exactly why certain decisions was made.

22:15.240 --> 22:22.040
With alpha zero, I don't think even Demis Hassab is the founder of the program from

22:22.040 --> 22:23.640
Google's Deep Mind.

22:23.640 --> 22:27.520
I don't think even he can tell you why version five played better words than version

22:27.520 --> 22:28.520
six.

22:28.520 --> 22:34.920
But the importance of alpha zero that is actually demonstrated that is chess program or

22:34.920 --> 22:43.400
go program or any program designed on the alpha zero platform will do better without any

22:43.400 --> 22:44.840
human data.

22:44.840 --> 22:53.680
All it needs is rules like a framework to work with to work with and it does the rest.

22:53.680 --> 22:59.120
I think it's it was quite sensational because while I thought that in golf, for instance,

22:59.120 --> 23:03.960
the human knowledge was quite poor because go is so complicated, it is a complex strategic

23:03.960 --> 23:04.960
game.

23:04.960 --> 23:12.120
And you could say that the the best go players today, they would be at the level of chess

23:12.120 --> 23:17.040
play a couple of hundred years ago, because no offense meant it's just the way they play

23:17.040 --> 23:21.360
because there's so many options, they just they have to go through this very slowly

23:21.360 --> 23:23.400
recognizing the patterns.

23:23.400 --> 23:30.080
And if you show chess games to a great player of the past of early 19th century, he will

23:30.080 --> 23:33.680
be shocked to see some of the moves today.

23:33.680 --> 23:40.640
But what's happened with alpha zero chess that by playing 60 million games against itself,

23:40.640 --> 23:41.640
right.

23:41.640 --> 23:47.000
Before ours, of course, with all massive Google power behind it, it created its own scale

23:47.000 --> 23:52.640
of evaluation, which is quite sensational because we didn't see before machines that were

23:52.640 --> 23:57.120
able to generate their own knowledge.

23:57.120 --> 24:02.560
And the way alpha zero played was also contrary to our expectations.

24:02.560 --> 24:10.120
It played very aggressive dynamic chess, sacrificing material and looking for patterns that

24:10.120 --> 24:17.160
even for me was, even for me, it was quite revealing because I mean, I could sense that,

24:17.160 --> 24:21.440
but just to see machine that could have the same kind of sense, that was stunning.

24:21.440 --> 24:28.640
So if you had some opportunity to analyze its approach to this game, so what I found

24:28.640 --> 24:37.280
out is that is alpha zero again, out of statistics, accumulated and derived out of the 60 million

24:37.280 --> 24:45.280
games, figured out certain patterns and connections between material, time and quality, those things

24:45.280 --> 24:47.640
are totally incompatible for computer.

24:47.640 --> 24:52.560
But just again, statistically, you know, it actually reached a point where it could see

24:52.560 --> 24:53.560
the connection.

24:53.560 --> 24:58.760
So that's why sacrificing material, playing with a pawn down or even a piece down, was

24:58.760 --> 25:06.920
not a big challenge for alpha zero because somehow, from the 60 million games database,

25:06.920 --> 25:09.800
it had a good compensation.

25:09.800 --> 25:16.800
When alpha zero played one of the strongest type A machines, chess engines, stock fish,

25:16.800 --> 25:22.240
we could see that it was always one or two moves ahead in getting correct evaluation.

25:22.240 --> 25:28.040
Now, why it's interesting because stock fish in this match that we didn't have the

25:28.040 --> 25:33.400
most powerful hardware that it could show, that it could give stock fish sort of the best

25:33.400 --> 25:38.480
opportunity to realize its potential, still it was powerful enough and it made roughly

25:38.480 --> 25:46.240
six million positions per second, alpha zero made about 60,000, so it's much more precise

25:46.240 --> 25:52.280
in what it shows to evaluate exactly, so I'm quite happy to say that chess still offers

25:52.280 --> 25:56.600
unique opportunity for us to continue these experiments.

25:56.600 --> 26:03.120
So it's about the way machine generates some data, how flexible machine is to change

26:03.120 --> 26:08.840
the data under the pressure of sort of of a new formation that is being introduced.

26:08.840 --> 26:14.040
And so what will be the human's role in working with these machines because people could

26:14.040 --> 26:15.640
get really panicked.

26:15.640 --> 26:20.280
And I'm to the contrary, I'm very optimistic because I could see an opportunity for us

26:20.280 --> 26:27.000
to share our knowledge and just to be what I call the shepherds of guiding these AI flocks.

26:27.000 --> 26:35.480
Did you find when evaluating these alpha zero games that it exhibited an entirely new style

26:35.480 --> 26:42.920
of play or did you recognize a human element in it or a reaction to the human element?

26:42.920 --> 26:43.920
It's a little bit of a style.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.720
Actually, it played more like Yarrick as part of the Anatolian Carpool.

26:46.720 --> 26:50.720
Again, contrary to the conventional wisdom that believes stronger machines will play more

26:50.720 --> 26:52.480
defensive chess.

26:52.480 --> 27:00.480
But what was new there is that it could actually move on sacrificing material without seeing

27:00.480 --> 27:06.520
immediate consequences because you could look at other engines that have that very powerful

27:06.520 --> 27:08.880
calculation function.

27:08.880 --> 27:13.840
And neither stock fish nor other problems didn't see the immediate danger coming out of

27:13.840 --> 27:15.400
the sacrifice.

27:15.400 --> 27:22.840
So which means that alpha zero based its sacrifice, not on immediate benefits, but on the projects

27:22.840 --> 27:24.080
of benefits.

27:24.080 --> 27:27.680
Chess has been very well analyzed, tons of books written about openings and things like

27:27.680 --> 27:28.680
that.

27:28.680 --> 27:36.680
I'm curious if in looking at the alpha zero play, did you find a new opening or a new transition

27:36.680 --> 27:38.400
or was there anything like that?

27:38.400 --> 27:46.320
What's not about new opening is that the one I could learn from the games I saw and

27:46.320 --> 27:51.920
two hours I spent with alpha zero in the lab is that it has created its own skill of

27:51.920 --> 27:57.440
evaluation, which is probably slightly different from the traditional approach.

27:57.440 --> 28:03.560
Is it more sophisticated, probably, maybe not, but what is very important at the machine

28:03.560 --> 28:06.880
came up with its own data.

28:06.880 --> 28:14.840
It has created knowledge that proved that what we believed was almost fit that complete

28:14.840 --> 28:17.360
actually had many flaws.

28:17.360 --> 28:22.600
And I think it tells us that no human knowledge considered dogma.

28:22.600 --> 28:30.320
I think I will help us to fight out traditional ideas that the human experience that had been

28:30.320 --> 28:35.880
accumulated over centuries, it cannot be touched.

28:35.880 --> 28:43.600
This is the foundation that we have to build our constructions of our theories.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.600
Anything can be challenged.

28:45.600 --> 28:52.640
It doesn't mean that everything will be refuted, but alpha zero opens a new era of us actually

28:52.640 --> 28:57.800
revisiting many things that just consider to be sacrosanth.

28:57.800 --> 29:03.440
Circling back to this topic of humans and machines, you've talked about in your book, you've

29:03.440 --> 29:10.320
recognized the historical role of this narrative, the human versus machine narrative, and you

29:10.320 --> 29:12.400
refute that.

29:12.400 --> 29:14.960
It's one that is easy to sell.

29:14.960 --> 29:22.760
Humans versus machine, we against them are humanity versus aliens.

29:22.760 --> 29:29.000
And that's one of the reasons why I'm so skeptical, actually critical about AI being

29:29.000 --> 29:36.200
presented as artificial intelligence, because artificial sounds alien, sounds frightening.

29:36.200 --> 29:38.360
It's like a challenge to us.

29:38.360 --> 29:45.160
It's something that will potentially threaten our existence because it's a different form

29:45.160 --> 29:47.280
of cognition.

29:47.280 --> 29:53.840
I believe that augmented is more precise because it reflects the idea of cooperation and

29:53.840 --> 29:54.840
it sounds friendly.

29:54.840 --> 30:00.200
And it's very important for us at this point is actually to walk away from these dystopian

30:00.200 --> 30:01.200
views.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.360
It's determinators, the metrics.

30:03.360 --> 30:09.160
I always remind people that capacity for evil is still exclusively human.

30:09.160 --> 30:15.360
And the greatest danger in the future, the foreseeable future, is not a sky net.

30:15.360 --> 30:20.320
But bad guys, dictators and terrorists that could have hands on the new technology and

30:20.320 --> 30:25.560
they will use it to undermine the very foundation of the free world, where these technologies

30:25.560 --> 30:27.200
have been created.

30:27.200 --> 30:36.440
And so in the context of chess, you've been working on some projects to exhibit the power,

30:36.440 --> 30:40.800
if you will, of humans and machines working together, how, or where are those efforts

30:40.800 --> 30:42.520
now and how, how do you assess them?

30:42.520 --> 30:48.560
I think the future of the human plus machine cooperation in chess will be probably in the

30:48.560 --> 30:55.160
field of humans plus type A machines facing type C machines.

30:55.160 --> 31:02.320
So just to recognize, so to test the flexibility of these new machines.

31:02.320 --> 31:08.240
And also, we could have the continuation of what is called now freestyle chess, humans

31:08.240 --> 31:09.240
plus machines.

31:09.240 --> 31:15.520
It could be one human plus, few computers or several humans with several computers.

31:15.520 --> 31:21.720
It's a different form of human machine cooperation with an idea to provide the best quality.

31:21.720 --> 31:28.720
And I think there's still many, many interesting experiments to be carried, because as I said,

31:28.720 --> 31:35.080
every problem requires unique combination of humans plus machines.

31:35.080 --> 31:45.200
And what we learn from chess and what I think will be also the case in, let's say, in

31:45.200 --> 31:54.480
medicine, in medical diagnosis, you don't need top expert to work with the best machines.

31:54.480 --> 32:00.520
Moreover, sometimes having the best expert in the industry could become the productive,

32:00.520 --> 32:04.480
because machines already superior in many instances.

32:04.480 --> 32:10.280
And you just have to recognize that you are there to form a partnership, but to be a partner

32:10.280 --> 32:13.720
that belongs to few, last few decimal places.

32:13.720 --> 32:21.160
There's nothing wrong about it, because we can start looking at our exclusively human

32:21.160 --> 32:22.960
qualities.

32:22.960 --> 32:30.240
I think that AI, well, intelligent machines will make us smarter, considering the form

32:30.240 --> 32:34.880
of promotion, because we can start thinking about questions.

32:34.880 --> 32:36.960
We can start thinking about concepts.

32:36.960 --> 32:37.960
We can strategize.

32:37.960 --> 32:43.280
There's still so many things that we do and machines cannot do it yet, or just definitely

32:43.280 --> 32:45.600
will not do it in foreseeable future.

32:45.600 --> 32:55.640
And I want people to stop fretting, stop talking about a GI that will dominate the world

32:55.640 --> 32:57.280
and will make us relevant.

32:57.280 --> 33:03.080
And let's look at the current problems and let's see how we can turn this most powerful

33:03.080 --> 33:07.080
tools that have been created to make our lives better.

33:07.080 --> 33:12.760
That's what we always did with new breakthrough technologies in the past.

33:12.760 --> 33:16.280
Well, Gary, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with me.

33:16.280 --> 33:17.280
Thanks for inviting me.

33:17.280 --> 33:18.280
Awesome.

33:18.280 --> 33:23.440
And it's definitely to be continued, to be continued, because Alpha Zero is the beginning

33:23.440 --> 33:24.440
of a new era.

33:24.440 --> 33:28.880
And I'm sure that every six months we'll keep bringing us more news.

33:28.880 --> 33:33.800
And again, I want people to remember the future of self-fulfilling prophecy.

33:33.800 --> 33:38.520
And it's for us to be optimistic and just to look for opportunities, not ignoring the

33:38.520 --> 33:41.440
problems, but not to concentrate too much on the negative side.

33:41.440 --> 33:42.440
Right.

33:42.440 --> 33:43.440
Thank you.

33:43.440 --> 33:51.680
