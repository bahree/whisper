1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,360
Alright everyone, I am here with Palo Martinez and Carlo Rodriguez from Clustera, live once

2
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:32,240
again from NYU Future Labs and the AI Nexus Accelerator. Guys, say hi. Hi. So let's just jump

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,920
right in and have you tell us a little bit about Clustera, what are you guys up to?

4
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,760
Sure, well we started as a retail analytics company like enabling Carlo and I worked

5
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,080
at a marketing innovation firm and we were wondering what could happen if Walmart had

6
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,400
the same data that Amazon has. How could they grow their businesses? And the pursuit

7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:01,560
of that response took us to where we are now. We attract people's movements on physical

8
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:09,760
spaces based on their anonymous Wi-Fi signals and we got some traction on that space but then

9
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,880
we found out we realized that that wasn't like we're the value recited, right? Like just

10
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,120
by tracking the people, what we understood, like working with some of the major players

11
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:29,560
in the market in Mexico, such as Anhauser-Busch, Walmart and Valaris, that's a very large

12
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:37,200
airline there, is that the real value resides in delivering relevant advertising to the

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:45,160
users based on their behavior in the real world and that's where Clustera is now at.

14
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:51,720
So you're not no longer focused on the Wi-Fi movement element of it or is that still part

15
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,240
of the building block? Yeah, it's a bit of a block but instead of using the cell in

16
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,760
the data as a dashboard or something like that, we use that data to correlate the behavior

17
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,840
of the people with their profiles, the data we get and then we target those people.

18
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:15,080
Okay, and so the general idea then is to allow so-called brick and mortar retailers to

19
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:21,080
have more of the kind of give them, you know, with an online retailer, you know exactly

20
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:28,040
what the customer does from their page path as well as maybe even heat map eye tracking

21
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,040
that kind of stuff. And so this is trying to capture some of that same kind of insight

22
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,960
for the brick and mortar retailer. Yes, to capture that insight but also to activate

23
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:44,680
it. Okay, we realized that, for example, Google and Facebook, they're massive companies

24
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,360
which their business model resides just in one simple idea is to make advertising more

25
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:57,080
relevant to the people. I think that's why they're so big. But they are just like online

26
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:04,280
to online. The things that you do online, they get transformed into online advertising.

27
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:11,560
But no company yet has really tackled, really nailed how to take the offline behavior

28
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:18,040
of the people and translate it into online advertising, which is important because online

29
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,520
digital advertising is growing like two digits per year since I remember. So it's going

30
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:31,960
to get just bigger and companies need that data to better deliver their campaigns.

31
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:38,040
And so are you telling them, you're telling them with the data that you've collected,

32
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,400
who to target, but what else are you telling them, how to target them, where to target them,

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,160
and are you providing an advertising network or are you telling them which advertising

34
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,520
networks to use? Tell me a little bit more about how a customer uses what you're providing.

35
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,000
Sure. Well, first I'm going to give you like a glimpse of how the solution works.

36
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Okay. And then I'm going to let Carlo like go a little bit technically deeper.

37
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:13,480
Okay. What we do is we interpret the, we hear the Wi-Fi signals of the smartphones.

38
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,240
Right. And they have all the audience most know that the MAC address is like the anonymous

39
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:27,000
device ID. We hear that and we can pinpoint where is that device located in a very,

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,240
very accurate way. Instead of geofencing that has a 500 meter like accuracy,

41
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:44,360
we have a 10 meter accuracy. So, so that's the first thing. Second, as people will

42
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,840
gathering a lot of data from the city like the Google card does, we also map out the whole city,

43
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:57,800
but the routers in the city. Okay. So we map the city literally, we like to

44
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:06,280
do it, exactly where all the Wi-Fi is for time. Okay. And commercial, all pieces of space, and also

45
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,720
organization. Oh, so we're not talking about movements within the store. We're talking about

46
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:14,440
movements out the world. Yeah. Above. Like inbound and outbound. Okay. Well, or outside the store,

47
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,920
like an urban level, like a city level, but also inside the store. Okay.

48
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:29,640
Okay. And so you are collecting all this, this database, you're basically locating the

49
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:33,320
individuals. And then what are you doing with that data? How are you aggregating it?

50
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, we aggregated as analytics, as Scarlett said, dashboards. Like, so our clients can understand

51
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:49,000
when do they users arrive? How much time do they spend? How do they move inside the store?

52
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:57,000
But also as users naturally connect to Wi-Fi on certain locations, then with the opt-in,

53
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:05,480
like with the consent of the user, we can match their device IDs to their online profiles.

54
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:13,080
And in that way, we can like make the whole cycle and start delivering smart campaigns.

55
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:20,200
For example, one of our clients is a major burger chain in here in the US. And they're using

56
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:27,800
our solution for a lot of stuff. But one of the main points is to understand how people,

57
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:36,040
like their loyalty, their recency, how often do they go. And if they notice a pattern,

58
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:43,400
and that's where one of the ways that we use machine learning and AI for our product,

59
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,800
if we identify that the user is going to churn, like it's going to bail out for a competitor,

60
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,800
because we compare their behavior to a lot of past behavior from other profiles.

61
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:02,920
Then we send an aggressive campaign to that user, because we know that he is like in danger

62
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:10,200
of bailing out of the brand. And so to make that a little bit more concrete,

63
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:21,480
I'm a burger chain A customer. If I spend more time in an area that you might surmise,

64
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:28,200
I'm sitting in a burger chain B, is that an example? Or are you finding deeper patterns

65
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:35,000
that would suggest that I might be more likely to churn? Well, there are three main

66
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:43,560
like things that we look at in building the model. Okay. First is as people connect to the places,

67
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:52,440
well generally they connect to the places they go to eat, like to have food, that we can have

68
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:59,960
like a sense of the competitors. If you go to somewhere, we can know if you have connected to

69
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:07,080
some competitor. First, second, we can understand where people live and work based on their previous

70
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:15,400
Wi-Fi locations. So we can understand the socio-economical status of the person in that sense,

71
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:24,280
that it's like they comply with that. And third, we see the patterns of the visits,

72
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:30,920
just like in Google Analytics, or in any like analytics, we have an analytics suite. You can see

73
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:39,400
how often the person goes. If they go daily, if they go weekly, if they go two times a month.

74
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:46,120
And then we compare that and we see, oh, we have seen some similar behaving customers that after

75
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:53,720
bail, after not going to the burger chain in three weeks, we never see them again.

76
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,640
That's when we know that we have to activate some campaign. Okay. Okay, interesting.

77
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,400
Tell me a little bit about your backgrounds and how you arrived at this problem.

78
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:09,320
Yeah, well, as Paul mentioned before, we met at the market in agency. I was a head of innovation.

79
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,360
My background is at the telecommunications engineer. I was in a gig since I was a kid. I learned

80
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,120
to call when I was 13, just from phone. And the thing is that it put me all through this to call

81
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:25,400
this and everything. I went to Singularity University and I was being, I am a maker. I've been

82
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:36,520
drones. Okay, sure. Well, we met there and at a marketing agency, I was a BP of analytics.

83
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:43,880
And all my whole career was in the marketing and analytics space. I majored in, well,

84
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:50,200
my knowledge in marketing, but I majored in applied statistics and then I studied a master's

85
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:58,120
degree in analytical sciences. So I always like tried to solve marketing problems using analytics

86
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:03,800
and data. And Carlo asked, he is very strong with technology and sensors. It was like a perfect match

87
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:11,080
for this venture. One of the things that I'm sure you get asked a lot is around the privacy

88
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:18,520
implications of what you're doing. How do you, you know, what are the questions that you're most

89
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:28,120
asked around that? And how do you respond to those? Sure. Well, they ask us a lot of about that

90
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:37,720
because it's like a sensical topic. We know that we're not the first company to aggregate customer

91
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:44,520
behavior and activate campaigns. A lot of companies have done that before. And we know that we're

92
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,960
not the only company that tracks people's movements with cell phones, with cell phone signals.

93
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:58,360
But first and foremost, we know that if we that we have to put privacy at like the first of every

94
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:05,800
decision that we make, because at the end of the day, we are not interested in individual

95
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:11,160
behaviors, but on aggregated behaviors. Like that's why we're called clostera because of the

96
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:19,640
cluster analysis that we do for the people. So in terms of how the two main questions that we

97
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:29,080
get asked is this legal? And the answer is yes. We have a very solid legal framework that

98
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:36,040
like allows, for example, to gather aggregated data and make sense of it in terms of

99
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:43,960
dashboards of analytics without infraging any kind of privacy law or anything, nor in Latam or

100
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:52,280
the US. And second is, well, if it's anonymous, how do you can activate campaigns? And the answer to

101
00:11:52,280 --> 00:12:01,400
that question is that when the user opts into our platform, they complied that we can use their

102
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:08,760
data to send more relevant advertising. And that's what Google and Facebook does. They take,

103
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,120
for example, your birthday and they send some special promotion because it's your birthday.

104
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:19,080
I don't think that any of you can like argue or be mad about it.

105
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:27,480
And so are all of the users opted in users? And what are they actually opting into? Is it

106
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,440
some app that you're providing or something that the customer is providing that they want to get

107
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:41,800
some value from? It's the Wi-Fi portal. And I get Wi-Fi networks. Okay. So and you guys are running

108
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,480
the Wi-Fi networks. So you have agreements with existing Wi-Fi networks to do this? Both, both.

109
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:56,520
Okay. Yeah, we can go and install just a sensor or like a Wi-Fi sensor. It's like a very small router.

110
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:04,680
Okay. That goes up on top of the existing Wi-Fi technology that all our clients have.

111
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,440
Or if there are some hotspot companies that we're partnering in Mexico, where we just

112
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:18,520
like put our platform in their existing sensors and then we can match the user profiles.

113
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:24,440
I was going to ask about this earlier and we'd moved on to something else. The degree to which

114
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,360
the infrastructure needs to be changed in order to support what you're doing. And it sounds like

115
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,440
it sounds like yes. So does that mean that in order to in order to grow you need to

116
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:46,200
like who do you have to go after these Wi-Fi portal owners basically?

117
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:53,640
What are they? But they're not the beneficiaries of analytics necessarily. That's the retailer.

118
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:59,160
So what's in it for them? How do you make them want to get engaged with you guys?

119
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:06,360
Well, first we give them the ability to better serve their clients without spending more,

120
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:13,640
like without because they give a very simple dashboard, simple analytics of the Wi-Fi.

121
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:21,160
And we tell them how if you put this code in your portal, then you will be able to give a better

122
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:25,240
product to the client that is paying you and you don't have to pay anything.

123
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:31,160
Okay. And it sounds like an interesting and complex ecosystem. So you've got the portal folks

124
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:40,120
that they maybe are their clients like Starbucks or someone that's hosting that's providing

125
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:50,040
at their location and then you guys are trying to use the data for the retailer. Well, it's more change. They already

126
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,480
are providing Wi-Fi to their customers. In this case, these chains, they also like we get on top of

127
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,880
what they have. And in this case, these chains always have contracts, maybe locations and that's

128
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:08,920
what we also have. Okay. Okay. Makes sense. So maybe a little bit more on how you're using

129
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:15,560
machine learning and AI to solve as what kinds of techniques and approaches come into play to

130
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:21,000
solve this particular problem. Well, as I mentioned before, you see that part of the analytics

131
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,240
is a building block towards the end product. That is the blockchain and audience. It's great,

132
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:31,160
great targeting profiles for the people. In the case of the analytics literature to measure people,

133
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:37,400
we need to identify which people is a visitor of the place and a passerby. Since from that

134
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:44,920
perspective, we need to classify those type of customers. The raw data that we get is a very

135
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:50,200
messy data because it's a lot of data that is coming from the cell phones is literally signals

136
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:56,280
from the cell phones. And we use models to classify which one is in the store, which was passing

137
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,960
in front of the store. And then after that, classify them in bucket like, okay, this is a new

138
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:09,160
comer is a returning visitor, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, also to predict future behavior. We get

139
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,680
that asked a lot like, where is the AI and what you have because in some other companies is very

140
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:23,080
straightforward. Right. However, in ourselves, we think like 10 years ago, maybe it was or 20 years

141
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:30,280
ago, it was very hot to say you were an internet company. Sure. And now it's very hot to say we're

142
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:39,160
you're an AI company. And we think that that it's going to like, how do you say that? Like,

143
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:46,760
it's going to permeate in all companies. So maybe in one or two years, it's not going to make

144
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,400
sense to say that you are an AI company. Sure. Everybody is doing that. It's like you say,

145
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:58,120
I'm an electric electricity energy company now. Right. Just because you use electricity.

146
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:05,400
This is a tool. Yeah. You are in the tool business selling pickaxes. Well, you sell pickaxes.

147
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,920
In this case, we use the pickaxes to build stuff. Right. Right. And the folks that listen to

148
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:15,240
the podcast like to hear about what kind of pickaxes you use. And it sounds like clustering is a big

149
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,120
one of the big pickaxes. You want to mean you want me to get pretty technical on this? Sure.

150
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:25,000
Sure. Well, you see we have many many many branches here. First of all,

151
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,880
is that all the holidays come for that. Of course, we use the cloud. Otherwise, we

152
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,720
don't have any any any any on premiums and stuff. And then first of all, all these cloud

153
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:40,920
go through that the pipeline that is drawn on the spark. Okay. We use to classification

154
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,400
sees a logistic regression and a decision tree. And based on that. What was the first one?

155
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,280
A logistic regression. Just a regression. Got it. And a decision tree. And with that,

156
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:57,960
we get to the analytic side and the first cluster, let's say, then we get the models for the

157
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,640
clustering of the of the behavior of the people based on the profile and also the behavior they

158
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:12,120
have some before. Yeah, that's my favorite part because we started using like her article clustering.

159
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,000
But then we started pioneering with a technical, not pioneering, but using a technique called

160
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:25,080
self-organizing maps that that it like takes all the features of the of the people and like makes

161
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:31,960
like like self-organizing map. It's like a technique used more for like machine vision.

162
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:37,960
Okay. Where we're using that to to make sense of all the the information of the of the data of

163
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:47,240
the users and gather them into very more, more smart or smarter segments that if we use just plain

164
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,360
clustering. Okay. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Yeah. And also we have different layers of information

165
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,160
that we get from the people in the case of what is just analytics well is just an ID is your macadras.

166
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,400
The macadras doesn't say anything about you. Right. That's why we are legal because it's not

167
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,560
personal identifiable information. The macadras doesn't give you the names, they give you the

168
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,680
phone numbers, they give you the email doesn't give you anything. Just the brand of the phone.

169
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,040
Uh-huh. Okay. Well, how did you be having such a physical place? But in the case of the people

170
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:20,280
opting in this in the Wi-Fi spots, we ask them to put an email. Oh, in these many 90% of the cases

171
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:26,040
face to logging, social logging. Okay. And once we get the social logging, we can we can know the gender,

172
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:33,160
the beard day, the likes, what pictures do they have like before. And based on that, we can literally

173
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,680
create a really good profile of what about you because, okay, do I see you in a hotspot that is

174
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:44,600
in a brewery or in a coffee place? And then I see you in another city, et cetera, et cetera.

175
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,400
It's literally reflecting your behavior. Right. And then with those closer, with those

176
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:56,600
audiences is where the way we make business. Okay. Okay. Well, that's exciting stuff. Can you

177
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,880
maybe share anything else you'd like to add or maybe you can share how folks can find you and learn

178
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:09,240
more? Sure. It's well, that first that we're very thankful for the interview and we're very

179
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:17,480
excited to be in this space and in New York. I think it's a very thriving scene. And that for all

180
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,960
our listeners that we would like to tell them that yes, there are a lot of there's a lot of hype

181
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:32,760
in the space. And like we were marketing themselves, sorry, yes, the machine learning company,

182
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,880
but nobody understood that. And then when we started solving the problem using all the

183
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:44,120
pigs and tools and hammers that Carol said, that's when things started moving around. So maybe

184
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:55,240
like have this change of perspective about the AI in on startups. I think that's that's important.

185
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:03,720
And we were based in Mexico City. So we can come visit us anytime you want. And we are at

186
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:16,920
Plastera K L U S D E R A dot com. Okay, great. Great. Well, thanks for being on the show. Thank you.
