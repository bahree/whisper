00:00.000 --> 00:10.720
All right, everyone. Welcome to another episode of the Twinmal AI podcast. I'm your host,

00:10.720 --> 00:17.600
Sam Charrington, and today I'm joined by Ori Kellegg, an assistant professor at CU Boulder.

00:17.600 --> 00:21.840
Before we get into today's conversation, be sure to take a moment to head over to Apple Podcast

00:21.840 --> 00:27.280
or your listening platform of choice. And if you enjoy the show, please leave us a five-star rating

00:27.280 --> 00:32.640
and review. Ori, welcome to the podcast. Thanks so much for having me, Sam. I'm excited to be here.

00:33.440 --> 00:38.960
Excited for this conversation. We're going to be talking about your research into collective

00:38.960 --> 00:44.800
communication in insect swarms. And I've already learned that there are multiple species of

00:44.800 --> 00:51.600
firefly. It never occurred to me that that was the case. We'll dig into that and a lot more.

00:51.600 --> 00:54.960
But before we do, I'd love to have you share a little bit about your background and

00:54.960 --> 01:02.640
how you came to work with machine learning. Sure. So my background is pretty interdisciplinary,

01:02.640 --> 01:08.320
and even within the realm of interdisciplinary backgrounds, I think it's a little bit all over

01:08.320 --> 01:14.720
the place, so bear with me. I started with an undergrad in computer science and physics,

01:15.520 --> 01:24.000
then moved to a master's in physics, where I studied soft materials using computational

01:24.000 --> 01:30.880
techniques. I then moved to, so that was in Israel where I grew up and then I moved to Switzerland

01:30.880 --> 01:37.120
for PhD in material science, where I started applying some of these computational techniques

01:37.120 --> 01:43.680
to biological materials. Usually small things like proteins and how they fold or how they interact

01:43.680 --> 01:50.800
with each other to be the larger complexes. And then for the postdoc, I made a switch,

01:50.800 --> 01:57.520
so first of all, I moved to the US. I spent time in a few departments first in chemistry,

01:57.520 --> 02:02.560
and then in applied math, so you get my drift on all over the place.

02:03.760 --> 02:10.640
And I made a big conceptual switch to study materials that are on the larger scale, on the level

02:10.640 --> 02:17.280
of a super organism, instead of small proteins, because I was really interested in animal behavior,

02:17.280 --> 02:23.520
and it was a really nice segue into that. And after that, I landed in Colorado,

02:23.520 --> 02:28.000
where I am today. I'm officially in the computer science department, and I have a joint

02:28.000 --> 02:33.760
appointment with the Bio Frontiers Institute, which is a very interdisciplinary institute,

02:33.760 --> 02:39.360
bringing people from many departments to study problems in biology. And I'm also associated with

02:39.360 --> 02:47.600
the Santa Fe Institute for complex systems. So it's a nice spot to be for people with background,

02:47.600 --> 02:54.240
like mine, where we apply lots of different disciplines to understand problems in biology.

02:54.880 --> 02:59.680
And naturally, since I'm in the computer science department, and we use a lot of computer science,

02:59.680 --> 03:04.720
we also use a lot of machine learning techniques for analyzing our experimental data,

03:04.720 --> 03:13.280
classifying behavior, and also in the simulation and agent-based models that we're using as coupled

03:13.280 --> 03:17.840
technique to understand animal behavior. Okay, okay. You said something interesting in there.

03:19.120 --> 03:27.440
You kind of characterize your work now, or your work with kind of systems of animals as large-scale

03:27.440 --> 03:35.200
materials. Can you elaborate on that a little bit? Yeah, so I'm specifically referring to

03:35.200 --> 03:43.440
honeybee swarms in one particular phenomenon that they or behavior they exhibit is that many,

03:43.440 --> 03:49.680
many bees, tens of thousands of bees, connect their bodies by holding hands or legs or whatever they

03:49.680 --> 03:56.160
can. And they create these really, really large materials that are completely made of honeybees,

03:56.160 --> 04:02.960
and they're extremely adaptable. They can suspend themselves from tree branches or rooftops,

04:02.960 --> 04:10.160
you know, lots of different surfaces. And that was then, I guess, an analogy for

04:10.160 --> 04:17.360
or a microscopic manifestation of biological material. Yeah, interesting. You have been fascinated

04:17.360 --> 04:25.440
by this whole idea of swarming behaviors for a while. I was initially introduced to it in the

04:25.440 --> 04:33.280
context of trying to emulate swarming behaviors that occur naturally in distributed computing systems.

04:34.160 --> 04:40.720
And this idea that you can take kind of the, you know, a set of simple primitives or rules

04:40.720 --> 04:48.080
and have each system or each participant in a larger system kind of implement these simple

04:48.080 --> 04:51.840
primitives without any knowledge of what anyone else is doing. And then you have these kind of

04:51.840 --> 04:59.520
emergent behaviors across the broader system. It's super fascinating stuff. How did you,

05:00.320 --> 05:05.680
like, what was what was kind of your entryway into thinking about these broader problems,

05:05.680 --> 05:11.440
these kind of systems? So, first of all, yes, I can very much relate to that connection to

05:12.000 --> 05:17.840
distributed algorithms and distributed hardware and swarm robotics, although we don't work on

05:17.840 --> 05:23.760
it specifically in my lab, I think that we have so much to learn from nature, from swarms that

05:23.760 --> 05:29.840
had a privilege of eons of evolution to perfect some of these collective communications. I find

05:29.840 --> 05:37.760
it fascinating. And I guess I kind of expanded, you know, I started with the honey bee swarms materials

05:37.760 --> 05:42.400
that I just mentioned. But there are just so many interesting things that the bees do, which we

05:42.400 --> 05:49.600
observed while performing experiments on on the honey bee swarms. For example, they use chemical

05:49.600 --> 05:57.920
communication where one bee produces a chemical signal, but because it's so it's very volatile,

05:57.920 --> 06:03.520
it can decay very rapidly in time and space. So, other bees actually serve as signal amplifiers.

06:03.520 --> 06:08.320
They stop at a certain distance and they generate a signal and then another bee does this and

06:08.320 --> 06:13.920
another bee so they can transmit the signal over larger distances. I almost sounds like spiking

06:13.920 --> 06:21.280
neurons. I think there's a deep relation to neurons and their synchronization or activities.

06:22.160 --> 06:30.640
Absolutely. Yeah, so when I opened up my own lab at CU Boulder, I sort of, you know, took

06:30.640 --> 06:38.080
some time to think what would be cool new ideas and new systems to study. And yeah, the honey bees

06:38.080 --> 06:42.240
was a kind of natural because I was already working on it, but the fireflies is another

06:43.600 --> 06:50.400
beautiful example of collective synchronization in nature where individuals flash on off.

06:52.080 --> 06:59.040
And it's probably as close as it gets to computer language in the natural animal communication

06:59.040 --> 07:04.560
in nature because it's such a simple signal. It's very similar to Morse code. So I saw some

07:04.560 --> 07:10.320
had intuition and gut feeling that these would be cool systems to focus on.

07:10.880 --> 07:16.640
Awesome. Awesome. And let's dig into that a bit more deeply. You presented on that at this past

07:16.640 --> 07:23.200
CVPR, some of your research in that area and the ways that you use machine learning in your research.

07:23.200 --> 07:30.240
Let's maybe start by having you expand a bit on the phenomenon that you were observing and

07:30.240 --> 07:35.200
trying to characterize and then we'll get into the way you apply ML to help with that. Okay, sounds

07:35.200 --> 07:41.440
good. So I'll start with maybe a bit of a broader background about fireflies since not everybody's

07:41.440 --> 07:50.080
familiar with this. So fireflies are are beetles and they have an organ in the abdomen that is called

07:50.080 --> 07:54.720
the lantern. So it can produce light. It's called light. It's based on chemical reaction.

07:54.720 --> 08:01.040
And they use that lantern in order to communicate with each other. Usually it's in the context

08:01.040 --> 08:08.320
of mating swarms. So that happens once a year where lots of fireflies congregate at a certain

08:08.320 --> 08:16.480
area and then males would advertise themselves by producing a flash pattern. So a certain sequence

08:16.480 --> 08:23.520
of flashes on and off. And then if a female perceives that signal and likes it and there's lots

08:23.520 --> 08:29.280
of different ways to understand what what a female likes. She would respond also in a species

08:29.280 --> 08:36.960
specific pattern. So these patterns the important issue about them is that they're species specific.

08:37.680 --> 08:44.480
Each species and there's thousands of species of fireflies has its own unique flash pattern.

08:44.480 --> 08:50.880
Can you imagine that if there is let's say one firefly in in in an area if you're just observing

08:50.880 --> 08:57.520
one firefly then it's pretty easy to connect the dots. So you know that there's one firefly here

08:57.520 --> 09:01.840
every time you see a flash that came from that one individual. So you can easily connect the dots

09:03.040 --> 09:08.320
and kind of construct the flash pattern that is individual performed. But as soon as you have

09:08.320 --> 09:13.680
more fireflies and you cannot see them when they're not flashing this becomes a really hard problem.

09:13.680 --> 09:17.120
How do you connect the dots? How do you know which flash came from which individual?

09:17.120 --> 09:24.240
In a sense it's similar to the cocktail party problem that it's a classical problem studied

09:24.240 --> 09:31.840
in neuroscience where the idea is that you're present in a loud wrong with many people but humans

09:31.840 --> 09:38.400
are really good at focusing on the person that they're speaking to and seems like fireflies are

09:38.400 --> 09:44.080
somehow able to do it as well but we don't really understand how they do that. So we do know that

09:44.080 --> 09:51.200
there's two main groups of fireflies species. There's fireflies who synchronize their flashes

09:51.200 --> 09:56.240
and then naturally that increases the signal to noise ratio of the collective swarm and there's

09:56.240 --> 10:02.480
fireflies who don't synchronize their flashes. So my lab studies both groups for the synchronous

10:02.480 --> 10:08.240
fireflies the species that we started working with a couple of years ago. We try to understand

10:08.240 --> 10:17.360
how they synchronize their flashes. So it's actually a non-phenomena. People have been

10:17.360 --> 10:22.560
knew that fireflies can synchronize their flashes for a long time but it was kind of dismissed at

10:22.560 --> 10:33.280
first as maybe people were just imagining it. Maybe the observers blinking somehow makes it

10:33.280 --> 10:39.040
you know when they perceive it makes it look like the fireflies are flashing in unison. Maybe the

10:39.040 --> 10:48.800
boat so it was in particular the first synchronous species were observed in Thailand on mangrove

10:48.800 --> 10:54.880
trees on the banks of a river so people were on boats or some another potential hypothesis was

10:54.880 --> 11:01.920
that the movement of the boat is maybe changing something about the perceived signal. But no it's

11:01.920 --> 11:09.600
after several decades of rigorous studies turns out the fireflies do synchronize their flash

11:09.600 --> 11:17.360
patterns and there has been lots of mathematical models to explain how this synchronization might occur

11:17.360 --> 11:24.480
but very little quantitative experimental data to actually validate these models and that's the gap

11:24.480 --> 11:33.200
that me and my lab members were after. Got it, got it. Before we dig into that kind of returning to

11:33.200 --> 11:42.560
the thousand or thousands of species of fireflies it is the species distribution highly geographical

11:42.560 --> 11:48.240
or is it the case when I'm walking down the street in July and see fireflies I'm observing

11:48.240 --> 11:53.200
many different species at work. The information about the geographical distribution is a little

11:53.200 --> 11:59.840
bit sparse at the moment. Fireflies have been very understudied relative to other insects but it

11:59.840 --> 12:10.640
is known that some of the species of fireflies do coexist. So it's not that uncommon to walk

12:10.640 --> 12:17.200
down the street or maybe in forest and actually observe swarms that contain two species of

12:17.200 --> 12:23.120
fireflies. And then the problem of course becomes even more interesting because we can have synchronous

12:23.120 --> 12:31.360
species and non-synchronous species overlapping and I'm really fascinated by how the females are

12:31.360 --> 12:38.640
able to interpret those signals and detect their own species. Kind of getting into the experimental

12:38.640 --> 12:44.800
part of your work kind of how do you set up those experiments and I'm imagining that's going to

12:44.800 --> 12:52.560
lead us to the role of computer vision. Yes exactly exactly so I imagine that until a few years ago

12:52.560 --> 12:59.680
there wasn't sufficient quantitative data to validate the models and we wanted to acquire that kind

12:59.680 --> 13:07.040
of data. And nowadays actually with very simple cameras, goal pros, sometimes even with our smartphones

13:07.040 --> 13:13.600
we can capture the very dim light of the fireflies. It wasn't the case always so I think that's one of

13:13.600 --> 13:20.320
the reasons it hasn't been it has been a bit understudied. And so what we do is we go to the field

13:21.280 --> 13:27.280
with cameras so it's kind of an unusual experience for computer science professors,

13:28.080 --> 13:33.600
PhD students and postdocs we all go together to the field which is really exciting so we get to

13:33.600 --> 13:42.480
see the fireflies and we record their flashes. Now in some of the mathematical models that I mentioned

13:42.480 --> 13:51.440
before the concept is that there's some kind of coupling between each agent whether that's a

13:51.440 --> 13:59.600
firefly, a person, a heart cell or actually even electrons in a in a superconductor.

14:00.720 --> 14:06.560
There are somehow coupled to their neighbors that coupling can decay as a function of distance

14:06.560 --> 14:11.040
between the two agents which makes sense if you think about fireflies maybe as they get further

14:11.040 --> 14:15.200
and further away from each other the you know the light is dimmer and dimmer and they cannot see

14:15.200 --> 14:23.200
each other very well. So space is really important we really want to capture where and when the fireflies

14:24.240 --> 14:32.720
flash and to capture the spatial aspect we need stereo vision. So we have two cameras and that

14:32.720 --> 14:41.120
kind of works like our own depth estimation as humans we have two eyes so we can capture

14:41.120 --> 14:45.920
you know the same objects from two different views and from that triangulate how far away that

14:45.920 --> 14:56.160
object is. So we do the same thing with fireflies and stereo vision has been very well used so

14:56.160 --> 15:04.720
there's actually code to to interpret these kind of data but we extended that method a little bit

15:05.600 --> 15:11.440
to eliminate camera calibration. Camera calibration is one of the most annoying things in stereo

15:11.440 --> 15:18.400
recording you have to go especially when in the field you have to calibrate the cameras both

15:18.400 --> 15:24.720
temporarily so make sure that the same frame from each camera view is synchronized as well as

15:24.720 --> 15:32.320
spatially so you need to know the exact relative positions of the camera and what we what we did

15:32.320 --> 15:39.040
is we could only do this because the firefly flashes are so bright in comparison to the background

15:39.040 --> 15:46.560
we actually use the firefly flashes to calibrate our cameras so we apply some basic computer vision

15:46.560 --> 15:54.000
we threshold the image to find where the flashes are in both camera views and then to we solve the

15:54.000 --> 16:00.960
alignment and calibration as an optimization problem so we find out for example how many flashes

16:00.960 --> 16:06.160
were recorded from each camera view and you plot that as a function of time and then we align

16:07.680 --> 16:13.440
this information from both cameras until they match so it's so it's incense an optimization

16:13.440 --> 16:18.960
problem where the output is what was the temporal difference between the two cameras.

16:18.960 --> 16:26.000
And do the cameras always have the exact same field of view or do you also have to account for

16:26.000 --> 16:30.720
kind of overlapping but not perfectly aligned field of view. Exactly they're not perfectly aligned

16:30.720 --> 16:39.360
so but we use the fraction of the field of view where they do align so that's a good point and

16:39.360 --> 16:45.840
we have to account for that yes. And so in terms of the optimization problem are you using

16:45.840 --> 16:53.360
any particular algorithms to do that or? Yeah so we're using some well-known

16:55.120 --> 17:00.400
I guess optimization code some of the codes we usually depending on how many parameters we need

17:00.400 --> 17:05.520
to optimize for the temporal aspect it's we just want parameter which is the time difference

17:05.520 --> 17:12.880
between the camera for the spatial arrangement there's actually more parameters because each

17:12.880 --> 17:21.360
camera has a three-dimensional position in space X, Y, Z and actually it's represented by a three-by-three

17:21.360 --> 17:28.560
matrix so we have enough parameter to start worrying about using more efficient optimization code so

17:28.560 --> 17:37.840
we we use a lot in the lab a method called CMAES covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary

17:37.840 --> 17:43.200
strategy that's a little extension of that and it's actually really cool because it's based on

17:43.200 --> 17:51.680
biological evolution and it's calculating the covariance matrix that each parameter set is

17:51.680 --> 17:59.760
giving you and making sure that covariance matrix is large so when the covariance matrix is large

17:59.760 --> 18:07.440
it means that you're more exposed to different landscapes on the function that you're trying to

18:07.440 --> 18:14.480
optimize and less likely to get stuck in local equilibrium and more likely to get towards the

18:14.480 --> 18:21.840
global equilibrium that's just one example and there's a few other methods that we use and

18:21.840 --> 18:26.640
we haven't invented them they're really just out of the box methods that people use for solving

18:26.640 --> 18:32.720
optimization problems. Got it and where does the evolutionary aspect of that come in to play?

18:32.720 --> 18:39.200
There is in each generation of the optimization code or optimization function there is basically

18:39.200 --> 18:48.080
a for loop and there's a certain number of points on the landscape. Each point corresponds to one

18:48.080 --> 18:57.280
parameter set and these points we kind of keep keep count whether they helped increase the area

18:57.280 --> 19:02.720
of the covariance matrix or decrease it. If they helped increase it then they're more likely to

19:02.720 --> 19:08.640
survive the next generation and that's where the evolutionary aspect comes to play. There is a

19:08.640 --> 19:15.440
fitness function to the points on the energy landscape in a sense. Interesting, interesting and

19:15.440 --> 19:22.320
on the temporal side is it you're doing some kind of like sliding window kind of thing or you're

19:22.320 --> 19:27.920
trying to see where and so once you have that aspect of machine learning is just helping you kind

19:27.920 --> 19:34.240
of set up your experiment and know where your cameras are and get them all aligned. Do you use

19:34.240 --> 19:40.560
machine learning further along in the research or the experimentation process? So that's the main

19:40.560 --> 19:45.520
aspect for the data acquisition and I will just I just want to point out that we don't do it only

19:45.520 --> 19:52.800
for ourselves. We are actually hoping to really extend the data acquisition and there's an

19:52.800 --> 19:57.920
ongoing increasing attention to five light behavior. So we hope to be able to actually crowdsource

19:57.920 --> 20:03.440
data acquisition and for that eliminating the calibration process is really crucial.

20:03.440 --> 20:07.920
Oh wow. So allowing someone to just download this onto a couple of phones and

20:07.920 --> 20:13.040
put them on a tripod or something and start to collect data. That's what we hope to do and

20:13.040 --> 20:19.840
actually this year we have an amazing group of scientists and just far fly enthusiasts,

20:20.640 --> 20:26.560
enthusiastic people who are volunteering to help us collect data and we're testing that method.

20:28.160 --> 20:35.600
And is the these alignment steps that we're talking about? Is that a post processing step or

20:35.600 --> 20:40.800
are you trying to do some kind of real-time alignment? So it's actually a post processing step

20:40.800 --> 20:46.320
although in post processing it can also be aligned along different windows of the recording

20:48.240 --> 20:54.240
which means that anybody who has a pair of cameras can potentially just record and then send us

20:54.240 --> 21:00.720
the data and we can do everything in post processing. So there is no you don't need anything else

21:00.720 --> 21:06.800
besides cameras and and tripods. Talk a little bit about what you do with the the aligned data

21:06.800 --> 21:14.800
once you have it. Okay so the once we have the aligned data there's two main ways that we use it.

21:15.520 --> 21:21.120
One is to understand far fly behavior, how they're synchronizing their flashes for example

21:23.200 --> 21:28.640
and I can talk more about that and I'll just mention the other the other way that we use it is for

21:28.640 --> 21:35.120
population monitoring. So as I mentioned each species of far fly has different flash patterns

21:35.120 --> 21:40.400
so just by using this recording and tracking the far flies in three dimensions we can reconstruct

21:40.400 --> 21:46.720
what was the flash pattern and from there we can identify the species of the far fly using again

21:46.720 --> 21:52.000
machine learning techniques. And that's important for far fly conservation which is has been

21:53.040 --> 22:01.440
generally neglected until a few years ago and and turns out that far flies do suffer from

22:01.440 --> 22:09.680
population decline due to climate change and due to light pollution. So there's an increasing

22:09.680 --> 22:14.720
amount of programs that are trying to objectively characterize the far fly populations.

22:16.480 --> 22:22.080
Right now the the way that people measure far fly populations or quantify them is kind of by

22:22.080 --> 22:28.160
eye so they go out to the field and try to count how many flashes they they see in which species

22:28.160 --> 22:32.560
but that's really hard to do once you have lots of individuals in the same spot so we hope that our

22:33.200 --> 22:36.960
more passive way to record far flies is is going to help there.

22:44.800 --> 22:51.840
Exactly it's hard for them to make when the lights are on in a sense they can find each other

22:51.840 --> 22:59.840
they directly changes the contrast between the far fly flashes and the background and they

22:59.840 --> 23:07.520
definitely flash less when when it's bright outside. So in your description of the ways that the

23:07.520 --> 23:13.760
things that you're doing with the data you mentioned identifying the synchronization patterns

23:13.760 --> 23:20.800
identifying the individual far flies I guess in a frame or in a video and kind of tracking their

23:20.800 --> 23:26.800
movement through the frame it sounds like there are a bunch of potential ML applications and all

23:26.800 --> 23:32.560
that to use machine learning for those areas as well or more traditional methods. At the moment we're

23:32.560 --> 23:40.720
using more traditional methods like thresholding and filling out you know little holes in the in the

23:40.720 --> 23:48.000
flash of the pattern these kind of things but it doesn't always work of course because if you're

23:48.000 --> 23:54.240
doing classical motion detection but there's little things that move in the background like maybe

23:54.240 --> 23:58.880
there's a tree and there's a little bit of wind so the leaves are moving that can really mess up

23:58.880 --> 24:05.760
with these classical methods so our next step is actually to use more advanced machine learning

24:05.760 --> 24:12.560
techniques to track the far flies which has been done a lot with insect swarms we did it with other

24:12.560 --> 24:22.160
insect swarms like carnivies it seems like it's a possible possible approach and we haven't done

24:22.160 --> 24:27.360
it yet but we hope to do it as the next step and I'm imagining that kind of collecting and

24:28.480 --> 24:34.080
labeling curating a data set is one of the big challenges to overcome in order to make it all work

24:34.080 --> 24:41.360
that's always a challenge so yeah preparing the training set basically is always the maybe the most

24:41.360 --> 24:47.760
time-consuming thing so you mentioned honeybees again talk a little bit more about what you're

24:47.760 --> 24:56.800
looking at when you're studying honeybees okay so honeybees totally different animal let me

24:57.520 --> 25:04.560
just give you a very brief background so honeybees living very very large are usually congested

25:04.560 --> 25:14.800
colonies there is one queen and most of the the rest of the bees are female workers there's maybe 10%

25:16.160 --> 25:23.040
drone males and the numbers we're talking about is tens of thousands or you know even more sometimes

25:23.040 --> 25:28.720
for a particular colony so it's really really large and the the communication there is extremely

25:28.720 --> 25:34.240
distributed is you know there's a queen but the queen doesn't really tell them what to do they make

25:34.240 --> 25:39.840
a lot of decision based on local information that they sense around them either from neighboring

25:39.840 --> 25:46.480
bees or from the environment and they make decisions based on that and somehow there's a lot of

25:46.480 --> 25:53.360
interesting emergence behavior emerging behavior in how they for example ventilator hive how they

25:53.360 --> 25:59.360
maintain mechanical stability as a swarm these are the swarm the materials made of bees that I

25:59.360 --> 26:07.680
mentioned before and they do a lot of interesting things as a collective as a coherent aggregated

26:07.680 --> 26:14.480
group but one thing we were interested in was how do they become a coherent group in the first

26:14.480 --> 26:20.880
place we know that bees can sense the pheromones of the queen pheromones are chemical signals that

26:20.880 --> 26:27.440
they're very volatile they they cave very rapidly in time and space so bees that are close to the

26:27.440 --> 26:33.120
queen maybe have no problem to sense these signals but bees that are further away are going to

26:33.120 --> 26:37.840
struggle so that that was one of the problems the first problems we started working on when I

26:37.840 --> 26:45.440
opened my lab how do bees that are further away our pheromones modulated at a frequency

26:45.440 --> 26:55.440
kind of fast enough for communication I kind of think of them as a much longer kind of wavelength

26:55.440 --> 27:04.000
signal so it really depends on the the half-life time of that chemical signal I think you write that

27:04.000 --> 27:11.040
usually it's more it's less instantaneous than a far-fly flash for example and it's sometimes

27:11.040 --> 27:16.880
it's passive so it's just you know the queen for example has lots of pheromones glands on her body

27:16.880 --> 27:22.080
she doesn't really do anything active in order to transmit these pheromones it just kind of diffuse

27:22.720 --> 27:26.960
passively from from her body so I think these are the two main differences

27:28.400 --> 27:34.400
okay so how do bees that are further away from the queen are able to find her of course the queen

27:34.400 --> 27:38.880
is really important because there's only one queen she's the only fertile bee actually that can

27:38.880 --> 27:49.440
lay eggs and help the colony maintain its colony size so it turns out that bees can serve as

27:49.440 --> 27:56.240
little signal amplifiers and they do something that in the beekeeping jargon is called

27:56.240 --> 28:04.720
sending so they stick their abdomen upwards and they open up a pheromone gland by applying this

28:04.720 --> 28:12.240
body posture and they fender wings so the airflow draws air across this pheromone gland and they

28:13.360 --> 28:18.560
depending on how their body is oriented in which direction that also determines the direction

28:18.560 --> 28:23.840
in which the signal is going to propagate so it basically propagates from their head backwards

28:26.000 --> 28:31.840
and we found out doing some preliminary experiments that bees use that sent in behavior to

28:31.840 --> 28:36.240
inform bees that are further away from the queen so there are like little Wi-Fi extenders

28:37.040 --> 28:43.600
exactly exactly it's like a little telecommunication network where the bees a bee that senses the

28:43.600 --> 28:48.960
pheromones of the queen would stop at a particular distance start sending further away from the queen

28:48.960 --> 28:53.760
towards the less informed bees and then another bee would come from behind to do the same thing

28:53.760 --> 28:59.840
and the same thing and the same thing so they create this really interesting dynamical network of

28:59.840 --> 29:06.480
communication that is extremely robust and adjustable also to environmental perturbation so

29:06.480 --> 29:12.480
I think it's a fascinating behavior that the bees kind of managed to do and we wanted to

29:12.480 --> 29:18.480
understand that a little bit better and that's where machine learning came into into the play so

29:19.440 --> 29:25.920
we wanted a way to classify the behavior of the bees in a high throughput way I mean we can see

29:25.920 --> 29:30.800
by eye that they're sending but as you just mentioned creating these training sets and

29:31.600 --> 29:36.800
marking the bees when they're sending that can take a very very long time just to give you

29:36.800 --> 29:44.080
the sense for one experiment we spend months basically cataloging and classifying the behavior

29:44.080 --> 29:52.000
of the bees that are sending so to overcome that we use machine learning where the training set was

29:52.000 --> 30:01.200
a collection of either snapshots or movies of bees that are performing sending or not performing

30:01.200 --> 30:09.040
sending and the output is yes or not or no are these bees sending producing the signal or not

30:09.040 --> 30:15.120
and also in which direction they're sending and these are the two important aspects of that

30:15.120 --> 30:21.280
behavior that we can then use to better understand why the bees are sending how they make decisions

30:21.280 --> 30:30.320
about sending in which direction they usually send and when we when we ran the experiments and

30:30.320 --> 30:37.040
the analysis with the machine learning classification of the behavior we noticed that indeed the bees

30:37.040 --> 30:43.360
the rest of the worker bees create a global map to where the queen is so they all sent in a

30:43.360 --> 30:51.920
direction that if you follow all the sending events you would end up where the queen is and we

30:51.920 --> 30:57.280
think that what happens is that they do so so that the further away bees the less informed ones

30:57.280 --> 31:02.000
can follow these signals to find the queen gives another meaning to gradient descent

31:02.000 --> 31:14.800
there's endless funds you can use with the bees actually interesting and so how do you use

31:16.800 --> 31:22.480
the kind of the understanding that you gained around this network and the directionality of

31:22.480 --> 31:29.520
the sending behavior yeah so finding out whether that information is indeed leading to the queen

31:29.520 --> 31:34.800
all the sending direction that was the first step that was kind of a proof of concept that we found

31:34.800 --> 31:42.720
an interesting communication signal that really has a meaning and in that case it's the global

31:42.720 --> 31:50.000
position of where the queen is now we can actually dive deeper we can ask things like

31:50.560 --> 31:55.360
how do bees make decisions how does it be decide oh now I'm going to stop and I'm going to

31:55.360 --> 32:03.600
stand backwards or now I'm just going to follow the signal of the other bees and from that we noticed

32:03.600 --> 32:09.360
a few interesting hints from the experiments we noticed that bees that are sending

32:10.240 --> 32:16.720
position themselves at a very particular distance from other bees that are sending and we can

32:16.720 --> 32:22.240
only do that because we have this you know big data set with the machine learning high throughput

32:22.240 --> 32:30.000
analysis so since we're dealing with a chemical signal that diffuses or has some kind of advection

32:30.000 --> 32:35.120
a particular distance from a source would imply a particular concentration particular

32:35.120 --> 32:39.360
concentration of that signal from the source if you just think about the classical physical

32:39.360 --> 32:44.960
equations of diffusion for example so that's really interesting maybe it means that the bees get

32:44.960 --> 32:50.720
triggered by a threshold of concentration of the pheromone so if the threshold is above a certain

32:50.720 --> 32:56.240
threshold sorry if the concentration is above a certain threshold then they start triggering

32:56.240 --> 33:02.320
their behavior their sending behavior another thing we notice is that this there's a little bit of

33:02.320 --> 33:09.680
estochasticity to that process so there is the bees have certain probability once they sense that

33:09.680 --> 33:16.720
chemical chemical concentration above a threshold then you know maybe 50% of the time they stop

33:16.720 --> 33:24.880
sending and 50% of the time they ignore it and then what we did is take these hints from the

33:24.880 --> 33:30.400
experiments and we actually plug them into an agent-based model that mimics what the bees do

33:31.120 --> 33:38.400
and we actually again used optimization strategies or machine learning to explore the parameters

33:38.400 --> 33:47.600
base in the agent-based model to find optimalities of the process interesting interesting going

33:47.600 --> 33:56.880
back to the kind of characterizing the pheromone is there is there just is there one pheromone or

33:56.880 --> 34:04.080
is pheromone kind of a family of chemicals in there are I'm trying to get a sense for the granularity

34:04.080 --> 34:09.520
of pheromones as a communication vehicle yeah it's it's actually a fascinating fascinating field

34:10.720 --> 34:14.800
I'll you know to lower your expectation I would say we don't really know we know that there's

34:14.800 --> 34:20.160
definitely more than one pheromone and the granularity of different pheromones pheromone is kind of

34:20.160 --> 34:24.240
like a cocktail of different chemicals and so it can you can have different concentrations of

34:24.240 --> 34:30.560
these chemicals different bees within a colony can have different pheromones sometimes it depends

34:30.560 --> 34:36.960
on their age bees from different colonies would have a different combination of chemicals

34:36.960 --> 34:43.280
that lead to their pheromones this is how they distinguish between nest mates and non-nest

34:43.280 --> 34:50.240
mates and it's a fascinating of action in animal communication is a fascinating topic that

34:51.120 --> 34:57.120
I think it's really not clear what is the right level of granularity in bees but also in other

34:57.120 --> 35:04.160
species so in your research do you ultimately think of it as kind of a binary signal you know

35:04.160 --> 35:11.920
with maybe some with regard to some threshold the bees either you know propagating pheromones

35:11.920 --> 35:16.960
or not exactly you're not trying to get to a low you're not trying to get to a lower low

35:16.960 --> 35:23.200
no we for simplicity we're starting as a yeah as you said a zero or one are they are they

35:23.200 --> 35:30.640
producing chemical signals or not in the future if it ever becomes possible to actually measure

35:30.640 --> 35:34.960
the chemical concentration of these pheromones I think it would be really interesting to try to

35:35.760 --> 35:39.760
further classify and dig deeper whether different bees have slightly different

35:39.760 --> 35:46.640
combination of chemicals and how they affect the yeah the behavior of the rest of this one

35:46.640 --> 35:51.360
earlier you mentioned that you were talking about the difficulty of data collection

35:51.360 --> 35:58.240
in this case as well and you mentioned that you overcame you it sounded like you were saying

35:58.240 --> 36:07.520
you overcame that by doing some some data collection and some classification I wanted to make

36:07.520 --> 36:13.760
sure that I understood specifically what you're doing were you kind of like bootstrapping

36:13.760 --> 36:23.040
a broader you know something that was able to operate on large scale by doing creating a small

36:23.040 --> 36:30.880
scale classifier like some kind of hierarchical thing oh no no not that advanced what we did

36:30.880 --> 36:38.960
is we basically prepared a training set so we had a set of movies or snapshots of bees that are

36:38.960 --> 36:46.560
sending or not sending that those were hand labeled and also the body orientation was hand labeled

36:46.560 --> 36:55.680
and then we train either a CNN or an RNN on on this data in order to get the output which is

36:55.680 --> 37:03.680
yes no is this be sending or not or and if yes in which direction it is propagating the information

37:03.680 --> 37:12.480
to got it got it and then you you're applying that kind of frame by frame on this these images

37:12.480 --> 37:19.600
that you capture and are you creating like some kind of you know at each for each be like a point

37:19.600 --> 37:25.680
vector of like if they're sending in what direction that kind of thing exactly and then what we do

37:25.680 --> 37:32.560
is integrate we take all these vectors and we construct a higher dimensional surface from the

37:32.560 --> 37:37.840
vectors are kind of gradients we use them we treat them as gradients we reconstruct the surface

37:37.840 --> 37:42.960
so then high values on that surface should correspond to where the target is in this case it's where

37:42.960 --> 37:50.560
the queen is in terms of kind of next steps for both the the fireflies and the honey bees and any

37:50.560 --> 37:58.320
other species that you're investigating are there things that you're seeing kind of coming down

37:58.320 --> 38:06.960
the pike in the you know or kind of already established in the machine learning world that you

38:06.960 --> 38:10.640
you know think are promising for your research and are looking forward to applying?

38:10.640 --> 38:16.000
Yeah so one thing we already kind of talked about briefly was applying more sophisticated

38:16.000 --> 38:23.120
machine learning computer vision tools for a firefly behavior I think that that's absolutely

38:23.120 --> 38:28.960
necessary and I think it would help us a lot to get rid of environmental noise and capture more

38:28.960 --> 38:36.160
flashes we might also be able to capture something interesting about the movement of the firefly so

38:36.160 --> 38:41.040
I only mentioned temporal information but the fireflies are actually moving and when they're moving

38:41.040 --> 38:47.920
they're almost like drawing you know a line particular particular shape with with their flashes

38:47.920 --> 38:54.400
so we're really wondering if there's any further information encoded in in the movement as well

38:54.400 --> 39:02.640
and we're hoping to extend our both tracking and also species classification based on that

39:02.640 --> 39:07.920
in the movement as well and that wouldn't be unheard of don't bees have like communicate via

39:07.920 --> 39:12.160
movement patterns or something like that I think I remember reading them yeah yeah very true

39:12.160 --> 39:18.320
so the bees use the waggle dance to inform other bees about a target that is usually further away

39:19.360 --> 39:25.120
so they use the sensing for things that are within a few meters beyond that they're actually

39:25.120 --> 39:30.960
using the waggle dance that is a slightly you know it has slightly different accuracy but it's

39:30.960 --> 39:39.200
fine or for long distances and the waggle dance basically tells the bees that can perceive that

39:39.200 --> 39:47.440
signal where is a good source of food or in a site how far it is and in which direction they should fly

39:48.720 --> 39:54.640
yeah so you know there's there's actually lots of different communication signals in bees

39:54.640 --> 40:00.320
it can be characterized with machine learning computer vision tools like the waggle dance

40:01.360 --> 40:06.160
maybe there's auditory signals that they use and actually people keep finding more and more

40:06.160 --> 40:14.080
new communication signals that the bees use usually they're based on just a person kind of

40:14.080 --> 40:19.360
staring at what the bees are doing and then notice some patterns but actually using machine learning

40:19.360 --> 40:28.000
tools can be a really powerful ways to more subjectively find some interesting new communication

40:28.000 --> 40:36.080
methods or signals that the bees use and that to me suggests kind of unsupervised type of an approach

40:36.080 --> 40:40.560
or clustering approaches that's something that you've experimented with yeah I'm definitely

40:40.560 --> 40:48.560
familiar with the methods we haven't tried it on the bee communication or experiments that we

40:48.560 --> 40:53.280
work with in my lab but I think it could be really promising future direction yeah all right well

40:53.280 --> 40:58.880
all right thanks so much for taking the time to share what you've been working on and the way you're

40:58.880 --> 41:05.600
applying machine learning to study communication and insect super fascinating stuff thank you so much

41:05.600 --> 41:32.320
it was fun chatting with you and thanks again for having me
