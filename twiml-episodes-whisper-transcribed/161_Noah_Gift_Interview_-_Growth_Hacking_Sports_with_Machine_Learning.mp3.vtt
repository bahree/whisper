Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

00:16.320 --> 00:21.480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:21.480 --> 00:31.400
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:31.400 --> 00:36.800
In this episode of our AI and sports series, I'm joined by Noah Gift, founder and consulting

00:36.800 --> 00:41.440
CTO at Pragmatic Labs and professor at UC Davis.

00:41.440 --> 00:46.280
Noah previously worked for a startup called Score Sports, which used machine learning to

00:46.280 --> 00:51.560
uncover athlete influence on social media and internet platforms.

00:51.560 --> 00:55.120
Noah and I look into some of his findings in that role, including how to predict the

00:55.120 --> 00:57.920
impact of athlete's social media engagement.

00:57.920 --> 01:02.640
We also discussed some of his more recent work using social media to predict which players

01:02.640 --> 01:07.720
hold the most on-court value and how this work could lead to more complete approaches

01:07.720 --> 01:09.320
to player valuation.

01:09.320 --> 01:14.840
Finally, we spent some time discussing some areas that Noah sees as ripe for new research

01:14.840 --> 01:17.360
and experimentation across sports.

01:17.360 --> 01:22.320
And we take a look at his upcoming book, Pragmatic AI, an introduction to cloud-based machine

01:22.320 --> 01:23.480
learning.

01:23.480 --> 01:27.040
For those interested in pre-ordering the book, be sure to check out the link in the show

01:27.040 --> 01:29.560
notes for a nice discount code.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.280
And now on to the show.

01:31.280 --> 01:34.640
All right everyone, I am on the line with Noah Gift.

01:34.640 --> 01:42.720
Noah is a consulting CTO and professor at UC Davis and was recently CTO of a sports company

01:42.720 --> 01:46.840
Score Sports. Noah, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.040
Hi, glad to be here.

01:49.040 --> 01:50.560
It's great to have you on the show.

01:50.560 --> 01:55.000
It is our tradition here to have our guests introduce themselves to the audience.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.840
And why don't you do that and tell us a little bit about how you got involved in AI and

01:59.840 --> 02:00.840
machine learning.

02:00.840 --> 02:07.240
Yeah, so I have, I think a pretty unusual background in that for a period of my life when I was

02:07.240 --> 02:10.960
about 10 years old, I worked in television and film, I grew up in Los Angeles.

02:10.960 --> 02:17.720
So I have this other career as a teenager and it culminated in working as a editor for

02:17.720 --> 02:21.800
ABC Network News on, you know, national news.

02:21.800 --> 02:26.200
You know, I remember distinctly cutting the story about OG Simpson and passing that live

02:26.200 --> 02:27.200
on the air.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.200
Oh wow.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.200
Yeah, so I had to keep going.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.760
And then just put push-paws on that.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.440
Like how did that happen?

02:33.440 --> 02:39.080
Is that like, did you start as like the typical child star thing and find your way into the

02:39.080 --> 02:42.600
quote-unquote back office or editing or something like that or was it a totally different

02:42.600 --> 02:44.640
path from what we might imagine?

02:44.640 --> 02:49.040
Well, it was totally different in that my dad had a television production company.

02:49.040 --> 02:52.920
So I guess it's a little bit like how, you know, there's kids now that are writing

02:52.920 --> 02:56.440
iPhone apps at 10 because her dad was a programmer.

02:56.440 --> 03:02.160
Well, my dad worked television and he had a company and I was working with him.

03:02.160 --> 03:08.360
I guess as an apprentice, television, camera, you know, microphones, editing, just knew

03:08.360 --> 03:09.360
all the stuff.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.360
Awesome.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.080
And then it just accommodated and I eventually got it.

03:13.080 --> 03:16.240
It's again, there's a lot like a programmer, you get a job as an editor.

03:16.240 --> 03:21.600
At the time, as you had to know the equipment, you go into, you know, a lot like a programming

03:21.600 --> 03:22.600
test.

03:22.600 --> 03:25.160
You go to let's say ABC and you say, hey, I'm an editor and they say, okay, well, let's

03:25.160 --> 03:29.200
see if you can edit and they give you a test and if you pass it, then they hire you.

03:29.200 --> 03:35.760
And so I passed it and I worked for the news for a while and this is 1992, I think,

03:35.760 --> 03:40.600
the 1993, and at the time I was, I was getting paid like $500 a day.

03:40.600 --> 03:43.640
So for a teenager, that was, that was, that was very nice.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.600
That was very happy with that salary.

03:46.600 --> 03:52.320
And then I just, I was actually given the opportunity to do that as a full-time job.

03:52.320 --> 03:58.760
But even though my dad was actually encouraging me to never go to college, I was, I rebelled

03:58.760 --> 04:00.800
and decided to go a different path.

04:00.800 --> 04:07.280
And I think part of it was that I've always been really interested in sports and I was

04:07.280 --> 04:13.520
competitive at basketball, football, track and, and in college, did to Cathlon.

04:13.520 --> 04:17.640
And basically, there's a period in my life where there's, I wanted to be a professional

04:17.640 --> 04:18.640
athlete.

04:18.640 --> 04:22.480
I didn't care what sport was, track, basketball.

04:22.480 --> 04:27.600
Even at one point, Ultimate Frisbee, I remember, there was, in my mid 20s, there's a guy

04:27.600 --> 04:31.680
that was trying to, you know, get me onto his pro, Ultimate Frisbee, or semi-pro, I

04:31.680 --> 04:33.680
guess, Ultimate Frisbee team.

04:33.680 --> 04:39.200
But that's probably why I eventually ended up getting a bachelor's degree from Cal Poly

04:39.200 --> 04:44.360
San Francisco was, in nutritional science, was just, that was my passion.

04:44.360 --> 04:49.480
And then when I, there was a period after I graduated from Cal Poly that, that I was training

04:49.480 --> 04:51.520
to play professional basketball.

04:51.520 --> 04:57.160
And I was training with some people that played on teams in Europe and I, you know, had

04:57.160 --> 05:04.360
some trials scheduled and then at the same time I was, my back at plan was to get a job

05:04.360 --> 05:05.360
somewhere.

05:05.360 --> 05:08.880
And I'd, I'd happen to get a job offer at Cal Tech.

05:08.880 --> 05:14.600
And so it was a very difficult decision for me to go, oh, wow, this is a Cal Tech or

05:14.600 --> 05:19.320
try to play professional basketball and make, you know, 20 grand a year.

05:19.320 --> 05:22.840
And I decided to work at Cal Tech.

05:22.840 --> 05:27.080
You know, I still in that way have some regrets about that, but I work, I, I, I got a

05:27.080 --> 05:33.120
job at Cal Tech and I, I really it, from there it changed a lot of the way I think in it.

05:33.120 --> 05:39.760
That's really what got me interested in AI was some of the people I met, I mean, really

05:39.760 --> 05:40.760
changed my life.

05:40.760 --> 05:47.160
I learned about Python there back in 2000, nobody used Python, but it was just something

05:47.160 --> 05:48.480
that all my friends did.

05:48.480 --> 05:51.240
So I figured I had to do it.

05:51.240 --> 05:55.560
And then I met a lot of really famous AI people.

05:55.560 --> 05:56.560
Just accidentally.

05:56.560 --> 05:57.560
It was like Forest Gump.

05:57.560 --> 06:02.560
I mean, the, the Feifei, who is in charge of AI at Google, I remember having dinner

06:02.560 --> 06:09.480
with her, just randomly meeting her, um, Kristoff Coke at the CNS lab, who is in charge

06:09.480 --> 06:16.640
of Paul Allen's Institute, just some guy I knew, um, one of my really good friends and mentors

06:16.640 --> 06:20.360
was this guy named Dr. Bogan, who did the first hemisfrectomy.

06:20.360 --> 06:25.440
Um, I remember going to his house all the time, hemisfrectomy, hemisfrectomy, removing

06:25.440 --> 06:31.800
half of the brain, uh, it was a, it was a, it was a procedure that was done to, um, you

06:31.800 --> 06:35.800
know, they didn't do it that often, but it was done for epileptic patients that had,

06:35.800 --> 06:38.480
you know, basically debilitating seizures.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.480
Okay.

06:39.480 --> 06:45.600
And he was working under Kristoff Coke and, and he became a mentor to me and I, I distinctly

06:45.600 --> 06:51.080
remember having many conversations at dinner about neural networks and how they're used

06:51.080 --> 06:57.320
to, uh, figure out who would be, uh, a fighter pilot and, and, and so all these ideas about

06:57.320 --> 07:03.080
AI and neural networks were, what percolating at the time I was, you know, an okay, you

07:03.080 --> 07:10.360
know, I would say, uh, amateurish, you know, cis admin type programmer, but so in a way

07:10.360 --> 07:16.560
as funny, I was much more interested in AI back then in my early 20s, um, and, and in

07:16.560 --> 07:22.120
fact, before I was even interested in programming, and I remember talking to a professor at,

07:22.120 --> 07:27.360
at Caltech and he'll probably, you know, he'll probably not admit to this, but I remember,

07:27.360 --> 07:31.560
we're asking him, like, hey, I'm so excited about AI, and he said, oh, you should even,

07:31.560 --> 07:32.920
uh, think about that.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.920
It's a dead field.

07:33.920 --> 07:37.960
It's, uh, you know, AI winter, you know, just, you're wasting your time.

07:37.960 --> 07:42.120
And I, I just remember thinking, well, I think I'll, I think I'll be interested in it

07:42.120 --> 07:43.120
in a way.

07:43.120 --> 07:49.760
And, and I had, I actually set this goal for myself that, um, and it's, I think I've achieved

07:49.760 --> 07:55.360
it, which is that by the time I'm 40, I wanted to be doing something serious and AI, and I

07:55.360 --> 07:58.080
wanted to be fluent in several programming languages.

07:58.080 --> 08:00.080
And that's pretty much happened.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.080
And nice.

08:01.080 --> 08:04.920
I think, yeah, I was part of it was just the people I met and, and also, I guess I've

08:04.920 --> 08:08.680
always been motivated by people that tell me, maybe it's the sports part of me, but

08:08.680 --> 08:10.880
people that told me, oh, oh, you can't do that.

08:10.880 --> 08:16.520
And it's like, oh, okay, well, that's exactly what I'm going to do that very nice, very

08:16.520 --> 08:17.520
nice.

08:17.520 --> 08:24.040
And so you, uh, Cal Tech led to a bunch of other places and most recently before you

08:24.040 --> 08:29.280
went off on your own to do consulting, you were at a startup called score sports.

08:29.280 --> 08:30.280
Is that right?

08:30.280 --> 08:31.280
Yeah.

08:31.280 --> 08:37.960
So, so score sports was interesting to me, again, because of the, the, the athletic component

08:37.960 --> 08:38.960
to it.

08:38.960 --> 08:45.240
And before that worked in film and had a whole other history of, you know, what a digital

08:45.240 --> 08:49.720
avatar and Disney future animation and so many image works, really cool film companies

08:49.720 --> 08:51.680
and where I did a lot of Python programming.

08:51.680 --> 08:57.840
But then, uh, and then I spent a long time in, in startups and, you know, doing that in

08:57.840 --> 08:58.840
San Francisco.

08:58.840 --> 09:04.200
But then there was a part of me that was a little not perfectly fitting in, I guess, with

09:04.200 --> 09:08.680
the culture of San Francisco and that, and that, again, I've always been really athletic

09:08.680 --> 09:14.960
and into sports and there, there's, there's almost like an anti healthy, I think it's changed

09:14.960 --> 09:15.960
now.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.920
But there's almost like this, like, oh, you exercise.

09:17.920 --> 09:18.920
Oh, that's weird.

09:18.920 --> 09:22.720
You know, like, at least I felt that way at the start of movie, but maybe I was, I had

09:22.720 --> 09:23.720
a couple of likes.

09:23.720 --> 09:24.720
I don't know.

09:24.720 --> 09:29.840
But, um, I really liked that this was a sports company and people worked out together

09:29.840 --> 09:35.600
and they, they actually did, um, mixed martial arts at lunch and so it was really interesting

09:35.600 --> 09:36.600
to me.

09:36.600 --> 09:41.600
I mean, this is, this is a, this is a really cool culture and I started there.

09:41.600 --> 09:48.080
We really didn't have a product and we, we struggled a little bit initially to build something

09:48.080 --> 09:54.120
and the first three months I was there, though, we, we were able to build a, um, a, uh, lightweight

09:54.120 --> 09:58.480
fantasy app that had a lot of traction and we're like, and we were like, okay, this is,

09:58.480 --> 10:02.600
this is maybe, we're on to something here and we were very fortunate, though, because

10:02.600 --> 10:08.840
we had some, um, secret, uh, weapons, I guess and one of our secret weapons was Brett

10:08.840 --> 10:09.840
Farve.

10:09.840 --> 10:14.840
He was on the board of the company and, you know, he, he was, we knew that if we built something

10:14.840 --> 10:20.480
that was marginally useful that having him a part of it would, would really take off.

10:20.480 --> 10:26.000
And so the idea for the company was that we were going to be a sports specific social network

10:26.000 --> 10:31.560
and I guess in a way, thinking about Facebook and it's funny now, there's a lot of controversy

10:31.560 --> 10:38.920
around Facebook because of, um, trolls and, you know, uh, yeah, fake news and, and, and,

10:38.920 --> 10:42.400
and, and at the time, though, I think really that the premise was a good premise, which

10:42.400 --> 10:45.640
is there are people that just really don't want to be on Facebook.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.200
They just want to talk about sports.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.200
Right.

10:48.200 --> 10:51.240
And that was the idea it was that I kept, they don't want to, they don't want to rethink

10:51.240 --> 10:52.240
news.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.640
They don't want to talk about politics or religion.

10:53.640 --> 10:55.240
They just want to talk about sports.

10:55.240 --> 10:59.520
And so that's what we started to build and took us about a year and we built, um, a social

10:59.520 --> 11:04.280
network and I remember we had, you know, almost no traffic and one of the first things we

11:04.280 --> 11:10.880
did though was we were pretty smart and that we, we used Brett Flarge to create a prediction

11:10.880 --> 11:13.560
around the NFL draft in 2014.

11:13.560 --> 11:16.840
And this is when Johnny Menzel was, was a big deal.

11:16.840 --> 11:21.440
He was in the NFL draft and, and he talked about it and posted it on score and then, and

11:21.440 --> 11:26.760
then linked to it from Facebook and Twitter and it just, I mean, it was like, uh, you

11:26.760 --> 11:32.880
know, one of the biggest, uh, traffic's days of all time almost, you know, it was, it

11:32.880 --> 11:37.760
was, it was, I think we got, uh, something like five million page views in an hour, like

11:37.760 --> 11:40.880
just a lot of, yeah, just incredible traffic.

11:40.880 --> 11:46.200
And then some of the comments were, you know, I'm crying, I'm so happy that Brett Flarge

11:46.200 --> 11:51.320
talking to me and liking my pose and we're like, okay, this, we're on to something here.

11:51.320 --> 11:56.640
And so as we, as we, at, we knew that there were, and this is where some of the ML and AI

11:56.640 --> 12:04.800
stuff comes in is that originally the thought process too was to, was to provide, um, tools

12:04.800 --> 12:09.440
for athletes to better engage with their fans, um, make revenue.

12:09.440 --> 12:14.640
We felt like they were getting ripped off by Facebook, um, and that if, if you look at

12:14.640 --> 12:18.880
the organic reach of some of these athletes, you know, they're, they're going down to one

12:18.880 --> 12:20.240
to three percent.

12:20.240 --> 12:26.560
And so we, we, the idea was that we wanted to, you know, give intelligent tools, athletes,

12:26.560 --> 12:28.440
create a specific channel.

12:28.440 --> 12:32.640
And then we knew that it's based on some of the historical data that some celebrities

12:32.640 --> 12:35.320
were like Brett Flarge created a lot of traffic.

12:35.320 --> 12:41.720
So the thought process was instead of what typical startups do, uh, by, by buying a lot of

12:41.720 --> 12:47.920
Facebook ads, we were going to create organic growth by partnering with athletes and, but

12:47.920 --> 12:53.120
first finding the athletes that were influential, partnering with them.

12:53.120 --> 12:59.400
And then because we, we're helping them, it was a synergistic relationship and that not

12:59.400 --> 13:05.560
only, um, would we get growth from the platform, but when you pay somebody oftentimes, they're

13:05.560 --> 13:06.560
very friendly with you.

13:06.560 --> 13:09.080
And so they're, they're open to other opportunities.

13:09.080 --> 13:14.480
So that led to two business, um, units in a company that I helped develop, along with some

13:14.480 --> 13:19.440
other people, which were, um, influential marketing, uh, part of the company, which,

13:19.440 --> 13:23.600
ultimately grew to millions of dollars of revenue, uh, and culminated probably the biggest

13:23.600 --> 13:26.520
deal we had was with machine zone, and Connor McGregor.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.880
And then we also had a merchandising part of our company.

13:28.880 --> 13:33.480
So we pay, we pay athletes, we find the best athletes, they, they create growth on our

13:33.480 --> 13:38.720
platform because we have this, um, you know, great relationship with the athletes there

13:38.720 --> 13:43.920
that open to do more deals, which are other influencer marketing deals and also merchandising.

13:43.920 --> 13:50.560
But the, the, the beginning stage there was that as we, as we learned from the data, uh,

13:50.560 --> 13:54.640
that was coming in from the page views and where it came from, we, we did realize that

13:54.640 --> 13:59.760
there was something there that we could, we could use machine learning on to enhance.

13:59.760 --> 14:06.840
And really that, the, the, the core of it was that we were able to look at signals, um,

14:06.840 --> 14:11.840
on Facebook, look at signals on, on Twitter and look at signals and other sources, including

14:11.840 --> 14:17.840
with Wikipedia and create an algorithm that told us who were the most influential, um,

14:17.840 --> 14:19.240
athletes.

14:19.240 --> 14:23.240
And there were some stars that we discovered and one of them was Connor McGregor and Connor

14:23.240 --> 14:24.240
McGregor.

14:24.240 --> 14:29.360
I think is a very interesting one and that, uh, I did this talk of strata just, um, uh,

14:29.360 --> 14:34.920
week ago, but when, when we partnered with him in 2014, I think his average likes per

14:34.920 --> 14:40.360
a post were something like 50, you know, which I think I've gotten posts that are, you

14:40.360 --> 14:44.800
know, 50, 50 likes on them, I mean, maybe not all of them, but it, and then if you look

14:44.800 --> 14:50.880
at now, it's something like, um, I don't know, 4,000 or 5,000.

14:50.880 --> 14:57.760
And so he's, I think had 7,000 times, uh, engagement growth in the last four years.

14:57.760 --> 15:02.640
And what, that was, that was one of the things that we noticed in terms of, um, in signals

15:02.640 --> 15:07.800
was that, is that the follow accounts are really, and I probably people know this by now,

15:07.800 --> 15:13.240
but follow accounts are really meaningless because of the bots and people buying things.

15:13.240 --> 15:17.760
Really the thing to look at is, is what is in, in relative terms, what's the engagement?

15:17.760 --> 15:25.040
You know, our, our, you know, if the meeting level engagement is, is, is very high in relative

15:25.040 --> 15:29.400
uh, percentage to your followers, then that means you're a star and you're going to be

15:29.400 --> 15:33.800
eventually growing, you know, like Connor McGregor, for example.

15:33.800 --> 15:38.040
And so those are the kind of signals that we look for, and then as we got more athletes

15:38.040 --> 15:42.320
that we partnered with, we would get more historical data and the algorithm would get better.

15:42.320 --> 15:49.760
And, um, in a nutshell, it did lead to us getting, uh, for a period of time, uh, sustained,

15:49.760 --> 15:54.320
you know, tens of millions of monthly active users on, on our platform, and then ultimately

15:54.320 --> 15:58.600
culminated in a partnership with, um, one of the largest soccer clubs in the world,

15:58.600 --> 16:05.480
which is Bayern Munich, um, but like, I think, uh, 97% of startups, we ultimately, ultimately

16:05.480 --> 16:08.160
failed, but there was definitely a good run there.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.400
Can you talk a little bit about how you used machine learning in that example?

16:11.400 --> 16:16.480
I think the way you set up the problem, it sounds like simple math, right, divide aggregate

16:16.480 --> 16:20.440
number of likes by a number of followers or something along those lines, uh, but it

16:20.440 --> 16:26.040
sounds like you were doing something else involving collecting historical data and training

16:26.040 --> 16:27.040
a model.

16:27.040 --> 16:28.040
Can you talk a little bit about that?

16:28.040 --> 16:29.040
Yeah.

16:29.040 --> 16:32.880
There's definitely a super, I mean, and this is one of the things I think it's interesting

16:32.880 --> 16:39.960
about machine learning and, um, in reading books or, or teaching, you know, in teaching

16:39.960 --> 16:45.920
a class at, at Davis, when I'm talking to this, uh, about this, is that it's easy to get

16:45.920 --> 16:49.440
a book that you read about some algorithm or psychic learning or Kaggle.

16:49.440 --> 16:54.240
It's like, oh, look, I have this supervised learning data set, but in the real world, you

16:54.240 --> 16:56.400
don't even know what it is you're solving.

16:56.400 --> 17:00.600
And that's in a way, kind of the fun thing is like, what, what, what problem are we even

17:00.600 --> 17:01.600
trying to solve?

17:01.600 --> 17:03.920
And it's, oh, we want to, we want to predict page views.

17:03.920 --> 17:07.840
That's what we ultimately came up with is, oh, so the more page views we get, the, the

17:07.840 --> 17:11.600
more users come on our platform and then they go through our conversion funnel and, and

17:11.600 --> 17:17.200
we get, uh, low, low, um, uh, acquisition rate for users, like a much lower, so what,

17:17.200 --> 17:21.320
what, what, okay, first, first thing was to look at, you know, what are the features, right?

17:21.320 --> 17:27.680
Like, what, what can we, what are the signals, um, that are telling us, uh, you know, how

17:27.680 --> 17:28.680
to predict page views?

17:28.680 --> 17:33.280
And so that did, that, that actually was a very complex problem in a way for, for a few

17:33.280 --> 17:34.280
different reasons.

17:34.280 --> 17:38.560
One is that, you know, in general, again, if it's not a Kaggle data set, we were like,

17:38.560 --> 17:42.480
oh, look, all my features are here, you know, like, in this case, you don't just don't,

17:42.480 --> 17:43.480
you just don't know.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.480
And labels.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.680
Yeah, and labels and, yeah, it's like, let me just search through here and figure out

17:47.680 --> 17:48.680
what's happening.

17:48.680 --> 17:53.080
So even in the case of, let's say, Twitter or Facebook, we had to, to carve through and

17:53.080 --> 17:57.720
look at, you know, what was interesting and what wasn't interesting and, and one of the

17:57.720 --> 18:03.600
ones that, that really ultimately came, turned out to be very predictive was the median

18:03.600 --> 18:07.920
level of engagement, uh, you know, per, per athlete.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.840
And I guess that would be for anybody on Twitter, but like the median level of likes, the

18:11.840 --> 18:16.400
median level of, of, uh, uh, uh, retweets, and the reason why median is so important is

18:16.400 --> 18:22.960
that if you look at just, you know, you just took necessarily, um, all of them, you get

18:22.960 --> 18:28.000
these outliers and it just blows up the data set, um, because there are sometimes somebody

18:28.000 --> 18:30.320
gets lucky and they get like a giant retweet.

18:30.320 --> 18:35.320
And it's like, ah, that just does not indicative of, of really their normal performance.

18:35.320 --> 18:36.320
Right.

18:36.320 --> 18:40.440
Um, so that's one part of it, uh, that, and then, and then also trying to strengthen the

18:40.440 --> 18:46.000
signal by finding other sources like, for example, I, I eventually stumbled upon Wikipedia

18:46.000 --> 18:50.560
and realized that, wow, that this is a, well, in general, I would say, I'm amazed that

18:50.560 --> 18:52.960
more people don't use Wikipedia as a data source.

18:52.960 --> 18:58.560
It's just amazing, but, but definitely correlates very strongly with, um, Twitter and Facebook.

18:58.560 --> 19:02.880
And so if you look at, uh, Wikipedia page views and you look at Twitter engagement, Facebook

19:02.880 --> 19:04.880
and engagement, they're very correlated.

19:04.880 --> 19:09.720
And so, meaning, if you're looking at influencers on Twitter and Facebook that also have Wikipedia

19:09.720 --> 19:11.960
pages about them, that you can correlate them.

19:11.960 --> 19:12.960
Okay.

19:12.960 --> 19:16.320
And, and, and, and so those are all plugging into the model.

19:16.320 --> 19:22.640
And, um, the other part that's, again, one of these cold syrup type or, or real world,

19:22.640 --> 19:23.640
I would say it's cold.

19:23.640 --> 19:28.560
I guess, yeah, it's a combination of cold syrup and real world problems is that, um, it

19:28.560 --> 19:34.720
is non-trivial to get, you know, let's say a thousand, um, social media handles, right?

19:34.720 --> 19:39.720
I mean, you, you have, you have, um, athletes, for example, that have the same name.

19:39.720 --> 19:45.360
So Anthony Davis is one of the stars in India right now for the Pelicans and there was

19:45.360 --> 19:48.400
it one period of time at Anthony Davis and the NFL.

19:48.400 --> 19:53.640
And so it's, it's, even in intern would get tripped up by that.

19:53.640 --> 19:58.520
And so that was a very, very significant problem in that, you know, you're just going to get

19:58.520 --> 20:04.400
garbage results if you don't have really high quality control around the inputs that are

20:04.400 --> 20:06.040
going into your collection.

20:06.040 --> 20:13.440
So, um, that, one of the ways that we solve that was ultimately, we landed upon mechanical

20:13.440 --> 20:14.440
jerk.

20:14.440 --> 20:19.560
And so what we did was we created these mechanical jerk jobs that would, um, ask, let's say

20:19.560 --> 20:25.520
nine people who they thought the social media handles were Twitter handle, Facebook handle,

20:25.520 --> 20:26.840
Wikipedia handle.

20:26.840 --> 20:29.680
And let's say if seven of the nine agreed, I think that's what we figured out was like

20:29.680 --> 20:35.240
a good number for the quorum, then we would, we would select that handle and feed that

20:35.240 --> 20:40.440
into our job collection system, which would then go out and collect the raw data.

20:40.440 --> 20:46.840
And, and then even that part of the problem is another significant problem is that, um,

20:46.840 --> 20:52.920
you know, Twitter APIs will blow up on you, uh, you know, you get rate throttling, Facebook

20:52.920 --> 20:55.760
APIs will blow up on you, you know, you get bad data.

20:55.760 --> 21:02.280
So, um, again, the real world part of it is it ultimately, it took maybe like a year

21:02.280 --> 21:09.320
to really get something with the jobs framework, the collection system, uh, you know, we're

21:09.320 --> 21:16.280
able to accurately, you know, get the handles and, and regularly, you know, run, run our

21:16.280 --> 21:18.160
collection algorithms.

21:18.160 --> 21:21.600
And then, and then all that was, again, about a year.

21:21.600 --> 21:25.960
And so the, the whole 80, 20 thing of, you know, cleaning the data and collecting it takes

21:25.960 --> 21:28.560
all, it's for me is absolutely the truth in the real world.

21:28.560 --> 21:33.360
I'd say even longer than the model, uh, training the model was almost nothing.

21:33.360 --> 21:34.360
Wow.

21:34.360 --> 21:40.760
And so the model output was, it was a, it was a predictor of the number of page use specifically

21:40.760 --> 21:44.240
or some intermediate page use.

21:44.240 --> 21:49.800
So basically, we could, we could at that point, um, feed in all those signals and figure

21:49.800 --> 21:54.080
out very accurately, uh, forget off the top of my head what the root mean squared error

21:54.080 --> 21:59.600
was, but, um, we had a pretty low root mean squared error and we, you, you basically knew

21:59.600 --> 22:03.800
exactly if you partnered with this person that give you, let's say, a thousand page use

22:03.800 --> 22:04.800
for posts.

22:04.800 --> 22:05.800
Huh.

22:05.800 --> 22:06.800
Interesting.

22:06.800 --> 22:07.800
Yeah.

22:07.800 --> 22:10.560
And then what's great about that is, is that I don't know if it's changed, I've been out

22:10.560 --> 22:15.000
of the VC game for a little bit, but, you know, if you look at, um, cost per, uh, cost per

22:15.000 --> 22:18.000
user, you know, we're getting users at like 80 cents a user.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
Okay.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.760
So you could back that into a cost per acquisition, cost per user and then use that as part

22:23.760 --> 22:27.120
of your, your fundraising and all that kind of stuff.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.120
Exactly.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.160
I mean, if you say users worth 40 to 80 bucks or whatever, you know, it's like, hey, we

22:31.160 --> 22:35.600
can acquire them for a dollar and then, you know, every dollar you put in is, it's a 40

22:35.600 --> 22:40.040
time to 80 time return depending on, you know, how you value users.

22:40.040 --> 22:41.040
Hmm.

22:41.040 --> 22:47.800
And so you, you went on from working on, uh, this kind of, uh, growth hacking type of

22:47.800 --> 22:55.600
application of machine learning and AI to developing some or at least, you know, starting

22:55.600 --> 23:01.800
to think through ways that you could more, uh, apply a machine learning and AI kind of

23:01.800 --> 23:04.240
more to the core of the company's products.

23:04.240 --> 23:05.240
Is that right?

23:05.240 --> 23:06.240
Yeah.

23:06.240 --> 23:10.120
So then once, once we realized that we really were on to something, uh, then we started

23:10.120 --> 23:14.160
to turn it into something we call it athlete intelligent dashboard.

23:14.160 --> 23:20.920
And we were on the, in the process of, uh, and we had some, some preliminary, like kind

23:20.920 --> 23:25.840
of beta tools that were dashboards that an athlete or a team could look at and they

23:25.840 --> 23:29.840
would show them, they would be able to see similar information to the information that

23:29.840 --> 23:31.080
we used for growth hacking.

23:31.080 --> 23:36.000
So they could, they could see, you know, in relative terms, how did, how does their team

23:36.000 --> 23:40.280
or how does their athlete or their whole roster of athletes, how did, how do they compare

23:40.280 --> 23:44.640
and social media, like, what do they rank, um, how many page views would they give in

23:44.640 --> 23:49.240
a, in a campaign, uh, who are their fans, what are some demographic information?

23:49.240 --> 23:53.280
And then as we started to sell things, we were also linking in, um, sales data.

23:53.280 --> 23:59.040
So, you know, what's, how many, how many, how many items could this, uh, athlete or team

23:59.040 --> 24:00.040
sell?

24:00.040 --> 24:02.960
You know, if, if there's, uh, a product that they're endorsing.

24:02.960 --> 24:03.960
Okay.

24:03.960 --> 24:08.240
And then when we spoke, uh, prior to starting the show, you mentioned, uh, at least I

24:08.240 --> 24:14.640
took the note as, uh, doing some work to predict the best players based on their fans, social

24:14.640 --> 24:15.640
media engagement.

24:15.640 --> 24:21.040
Were you speaking of best in terms of best performing from a kind of marketing influence

24:21.040 --> 24:26.400
or perspective, or was there a crossover to actual player on the field performance based

24:26.400 --> 24:29.080
on their fan engagement?

24:29.080 --> 24:30.080
Yeah.

24:30.080 --> 24:35.720
So, uh, after, after the startup, you know, unfortunately, you know, ran out of cash

24:35.720 --> 24:40.960
and, and some business deals that work out and, and, and I left, um, and ultimately they

24:40.960 --> 24:41.960
don't exist anymore.

24:41.960 --> 24:45.480
Uh, I, I still was thinking about the problem because it was a, it was a really interesting

24:45.480 --> 24:46.480
problem.

24:46.480 --> 24:52.880
And over the last year, as I've decided to write a book on this, I'm not exactly a hundred

24:52.880 --> 24:55.880
percent the subject, but I, I was digging into it more and more.

24:55.880 --> 25:00.880
And one of the, the, the areas that I was interested in was, is that social media was

25:00.880 --> 25:06.080
able to predict, you know, basically, uh, how many page views somebody could give to a

25:06.080 --> 25:11.240
platform and how many products, but I was curious whether it could also predict how good

25:11.240 --> 25:12.240
a player was.

25:12.240 --> 25:18.440
And, in fact, even predict, um, you know, winning, winning like, like, uh, how, you know,

25:18.440 --> 25:20.440
how many wins a player could bring to the team.

25:20.440 --> 25:27.360
And so, I've spent, I would say several months on this this year and the preliminary information

25:27.360 --> 25:33.640
I have is very promising and that some of the conclusions so far are that it does appear

25:33.640 --> 25:40.400
that in the NBA that, that, that owners will play, uh, will pay, um, versus points.

25:40.400 --> 25:46.160
And so anybody that's, uh, a basketball, um, statistics person knows that points are

25:46.160 --> 25:51.520
not, I mean, they're, they're, they're, they're a reasonable predictor of, of winning and,

25:51.520 --> 25:55.360
um, you know, play, uh, play up performance, things like that, but, but there's a lot more

25:55.360 --> 25:56.360
to it.

25:56.360 --> 26:00.920
So players will be paid by, uh, in general by the owners, but, you know, something like

26:00.920 --> 26:03.200
about a point, a million point.

26:03.200 --> 26:07.680
So if you, you know, 10 points a game, you make 10 million, but, but if you really dig

26:07.680 --> 26:13.880
into it, uh, one of the best measures of, of how productive a player is is wins over, essentially

26:13.880 --> 26:17.680
the wins over replacement or, um, I think it's wins, RPM.

26:17.680 --> 26:21.000
So how many wins are attributable specifically to you?

26:21.000 --> 26:24.720
And off the top of my head, I think LeBron James, for example, is a, is a perfect, you

26:24.720 --> 26:31.440
know, like, an outlier in that, I think it's something like 23 or 25 games, just, you

26:31.440 --> 26:37.120
know, there's what 70 something games in the NBA and just LeBron James himself to the

26:37.120 --> 26:39.880
Cleveland Cavaliers is like 23 games.

26:39.880 --> 26:45.800
So he basically puts them in the playoffs just here, you know, and, um, what, uh, so what

26:45.800 --> 26:52.920
I, what I was digging into was, well, do fans engage more highly with, um, uh, players

26:52.920 --> 26:59.000
who have high points or, or players who have, um, you know, better, let's say, say, overall

26:59.000 --> 27:01.480
performance like wins, like wins RPM.

27:01.480 --> 27:05.760
And it does appear that the, that fans, and, you know, but I have, I don't have enough

27:05.760 --> 27:09.920
data to do, to collect this and maybe if somebody wants to hire me to do a year project

27:09.920 --> 27:17.360
on, I would dig more, but it does appear that, um, that, that fans are, are actually really

27:17.360 --> 27:23.480
good judges in terms of, they like to engage with the best players and, and, and, and if,

27:23.480 --> 27:28.080
if you look at, you know, they're, they're engaging lesser with the hype, the high point.

27:28.080 --> 27:32.760
I mean, they're obviously engaging them, but if, if you look at, if you plot, uh, you

27:32.760 --> 27:38.360
know, wins over replacement versus points, you can see the fans more, uh, are more engaged

27:38.360 --> 27:43.720
with the true players who are, who are, um, contributing to their overall team's performance.

27:43.720 --> 27:49.240
So the, I guess the takeaways there, again, this is still pretty, pretty, preliminary

27:49.240 --> 27:54.640
and it's possible I'm, I'm making something in accurate conclusions, but the takeaways

27:54.640 --> 28:00.440
are that, you know, you could start to feed this into, um, uh, you know, better, you know,

28:00.440 --> 28:06.640
algorithms, for example, or, uh, fantasy, you know, you know, you know, fantasy team and,

28:06.640 --> 28:11.440
and, uh, I think it's pretty fascinating again that if you just look at Wikipedia, you

28:11.440 --> 28:15.600
know, it's got this free data set for you, and it's got this incredible power to show

28:15.600 --> 28:21.200
you that, you know, that, that even with the page views, like, if you look at page views,

28:21.200 --> 28:26.160
that, that it appears that, that the best players in terms of the true metrics, like, uh,

28:26.160 --> 28:32.120
Windsor PM, they get, they get higher page views, and if you look at points, hmm.

28:32.120 --> 28:37.320
And do you, is this a, is this something that you think might be, you know, granted your

28:37.320 --> 28:41.680
early in, in the research here, but is this something that you think might be usable as

28:41.680 --> 28:47.560
a leading indicator, meaning helping teams find the next LeBron James or someone who's

28:47.560 --> 28:53.360
undervalued relative to what they're being paid now and help them kind of, uh, you

28:53.360 --> 28:59.800
know, take advantage of that kind of information in, uh, draft type of situations or scouting

28:59.800 --> 29:05.720
types of situations or is it more, um, you know, what's happening in, you know, Wikipedia

29:05.720 --> 29:10.560
social media is an indication of what's happening now and, and not necessarily, you know, having

29:10.560 --> 29:11.560
predictive value.

29:11.560 --> 29:16.160
No, I think it could be a leading indicator and let's, let's take kind of a greater, for

29:16.160 --> 29:17.160
example.

29:17.160 --> 29:25.560
So, um, I will readily admit, uh, I've been a, been a, I would say a, uh, someone new

29:25.560 --> 29:32.160
fan to, um, to, to MMA and UFC, and, you know, part of it was working at the company,

29:32.160 --> 29:36.480
but I remember when Conor McGregor came out and thought, ah, you know, this, this guy's

29:36.480 --> 29:40.960
a showboat, you know, he's, he's going to get destroyed eventually, but the fans, if

29:40.960 --> 29:47.000
you look at the engagement, they must have known something because, um, the, the engagement

29:47.000 --> 29:49.960
level was just incredible in relative terms.

29:49.960 --> 29:55.840
And so I do think there's something there where, you know, the collective wisdom of fans

29:55.840 --> 30:02.160
who really know this local athlete that really, really, really, it says something like, like,

30:02.160 --> 30:04.240
they know something that other people don't know.

30:04.240 --> 30:09.320
And so it, in a way, I think it's a signal that absolutely you could use, and again, this

30:09.320 --> 30:13.640
would be a really fascinating project, it's to look at, let's say NFL drafts and, and

30:13.640 --> 30:18.080
look at the local engagement for, let's say, uh, players.

30:18.080 --> 30:23.840
And if you, instead of looking at these BS stats like, you know, the four yard dash and

30:23.840 --> 30:27.480
all these things that they've shown that I have very little correlations to successfully

30:27.480 --> 30:32.960
NFL, I'd be interested if you plotted that against their social media engagement.

30:32.960 --> 30:37.840
If you would then show if that's predictive of their future success in NFL, again, just

30:37.840 --> 30:41.920
a theory, but I, but I, I have suspicions that there's something there.

30:41.920 --> 30:48.680
Are there players that are that have kind of an outsized social media impact that doesn't

30:48.680 --> 30:55.040
correlate to wins or performance like the exact opposite of, you know, what we're speculating

30:55.040 --> 31:01.480
about now, um, a player that, you know, has, you know, super high social media engagement

31:01.480 --> 31:08.320
and, and potentially as a result of that hat brings super, you know, high value to a team

31:08.320 --> 31:13.720
from a kind of marketing and, and audience engagement perspective, but isn't necessarily

31:13.720 --> 31:17.520
a winning or high scoring player, does that kind of scenario ring any bells?

31:17.520 --> 31:22.800
Yeah, I mean, I could, I could see how you could maybe do some clustering and you could,

31:22.800 --> 31:28.320
you could, you could maybe even classification, like you could, you could say there's, let's

31:28.320 --> 31:31.920
just, off the top of my head, just, just kind of brainstorming here, but like you, you

31:31.920 --> 31:38.080
have Tim Tibo cluster, you know, like, where, like super, super engaged fans, but turns

31:38.080 --> 31:39.480
out, not that good.

31:39.480 --> 31:45.060
And then you have, um, and then you have another cluster, which is that super, super engaged

31:45.060 --> 31:49.520
fans that turns out that they're actually, uh, above average, like significantly above

31:49.520 --> 31:50.520
average.

31:50.520 --> 31:51.520
So, right.

31:51.520 --> 31:54.920
Yeah, I think there is some, there is some probably some, you know, there's a BCG matrix

31:54.920 --> 32:01.720
here that's like your, your popular winners, your popular losers, your, um, popular losers

32:01.720 --> 32:07.160
that you need to get rid of and then your, uh, your winners that are unpopular that maybe

32:07.160 --> 32:11.120
are your, I don't know what you, what the cute names you would assign to these quadrants

32:11.120 --> 32:15.720
are, but, you know, maybe those year, you know, hidden gems are undervalued folks or

32:15.720 --> 32:19.920
something like that that you need to figure out how to, you know, engage with, with fans

32:19.920 --> 32:20.920
or something.

32:20.920 --> 32:21.920
Yeah.

32:21.920 --> 32:22.920
Yeah.

32:22.920 --> 32:26.520
I, I, there's definitely, you know, there's definitely something there and it's surprising

32:26.520 --> 32:29.360
that, uh, I have not heard more about it.

32:29.360 --> 32:30.360
Hmm.

32:30.360 --> 32:31.360
Yeah.

32:31.360 --> 32:35.520
I, you know, I have, I have said on the podcast before that I'm not the, the biggest sports

32:35.520 --> 32:42.800
fan, uh, at all, our producer is a huge sports fan and so we, uh, have, have some interesting

32:42.800 --> 32:50.040
plans to do, uh, some conversations around how machine learning and NAI apply to sports.

32:50.040 --> 32:57.880
But I, I will say that my appreciation for sports, you know, multiplied by, you know,

32:57.880 --> 33:00.520
who knows how many orders of magnitudes after reading money ball.

33:00.520 --> 33:06.240
I thought that, that, you know, the treatment of, um, Billy Bean and the A's and kind of

33:06.240 --> 33:12.040
understanding how he used this insight about a particular metric was being undervalued

33:12.040 --> 33:19.320
by the marketplace and really changed the way folks, staff, baseball teams, um, that

33:19.320 --> 33:20.320
was amazing.

33:20.320 --> 33:21.320
That was fantastic.

33:21.320 --> 33:28.280
Well, it's, and I, I'm not 100% sure how much I could talk about this, but, uh, there,

33:28.280 --> 33:34.480
I'll, I'll just, I'll say in rough terms that there was a company that were, you know,

33:34.480 --> 33:40.480
I knew of from when I used to play pickup basketball at Caltech, um, with, with the founder

33:40.480 --> 33:46.400
and, um, he was working with some teams, the NBA and also with NFL and they, they, they

33:46.400 --> 33:53.160
were looking at motion tracking data and, and actually they had algorithms that gave

33:53.160 --> 33:58.600
teams insights like, uh, the center in the fourth quarter is going to just be horrible.

33:58.600 --> 34:04.800
So go out of, you know, or, you know, it, it, take, this player has a horrible left hand

34:04.800 --> 34:10.800
and so, um, basically make them go left and, and I won't, I won't say what's teams or,

34:10.800 --> 34:12.360
I don't know if I'm supposed to say it or not.

34:12.360 --> 34:15.520
So I'll just, I'll just leave it, but, but they're definitely are, they're definitely

34:15.520 --> 34:21.680
are, um, they're, this is happening, um, in sports and there are people that are using

34:21.680 --> 34:26.280
machine learning, uh, especially on like things like motion tracking data and they do have

34:26.280 --> 34:32.800
some, some secret information that I'm sure is playing a, a role in the amount of wins

34:32.800 --> 34:33.800
they have.

34:33.800 --> 34:37.920
And so, you know, I think you can make an argument for teams, let's say the NBA because

34:37.920 --> 34:42.600
I have some, a little bit of information that maybe some of the teams that, even we can

34:42.600 --> 34:48.120
think of off the top of our head, um, that, that have a lot of wins may have some secrets

34:48.120 --> 34:54.240
that, that, that, uh, they have algorithms that, that let them have insights that other

34:54.240 --> 34:55.240
teams don't have.

34:55.240 --> 35:01.400
And so there, there's a little bit of a, um, uh, a race, I guess, uh, I don't, I don't

35:01.400 --> 35:03.720
have all the info, but, but I know a little bit.

35:03.720 --> 35:08.280
Yeah, you've got to imagine that, uh, you know, the popularization and money ball, if

35:08.280 --> 35:13.240
it wasn't already kind of an open secret, the data can make a difference in sports, you

35:13.240 --> 35:19.880
know, that kind of blew the top off and, uh, now that, uh, machine learning has become

35:19.880 --> 35:25.600
so much more accessible, um, you've got to imagine that any owner or general manager

35:25.600 --> 35:32.720
kind of worth their salt is at least experimenting with, um, how to apply this both on the field,

35:32.720 --> 35:38.200
on the court, as well as in terms of the business, uh, ticket sales and advertising and all

35:38.200 --> 35:39.200
that kind of stuff.

35:39.200 --> 35:44.600
Yeah, well, and, and so that was, that, that, that actually does lead to a, uh, other area

35:44.600 --> 35:48.440
that I was doing a little bit of research on that again, I, I'm, you know, how, I would

35:48.440 --> 35:54.120
love to do more research on is how is the valuation of a team set, uh, and what's interesting

35:54.120 --> 35:59.960
is in the NBA, for example, uh, the two most valued teams are the Los Angeles Lakers

35:59.960 --> 36:03.720
and the New York Knicks, uh, each are, we're several billion dollars.

36:03.720 --> 36:08.640
And if you look at their, their, their, um, records, I think the lake is a little better

36:08.640 --> 36:09.640
this year.

36:09.640 --> 36:12.480
But if you look at their records the last few years, it's, I mean, they're, they're

36:12.480 --> 36:13.480
very bad.

36:13.480 --> 36:14.480
I mean, very bad.

36:14.480 --> 36:19.560
And, and what's interesting is that attendance really doesn't seem to be affected by this

36:19.560 --> 36:20.560
evaluate.

36:20.560 --> 36:23.960
And, and then if you dig into it, it's, you know, what, what are the things that predict

36:23.960 --> 36:29.000
the most, uh, valuations of a team and it, it's actually pretty boring so far as like,

36:29.000 --> 36:33.160
you know, things like what's the meeting home price and what's the population density?

36:33.160 --> 36:34.160
Yeah.

36:34.160 --> 36:37.680
So my immediate market size when you mention those two teams.

36:37.680 --> 36:38.680
Yeah.

36:38.680 --> 36:42.360
So like if you live in a major metropolitan area with high real estate values, you're going

36:42.360 --> 36:43.760
to have a highly, highly valued team.

36:43.760 --> 36:49.800
And so in a way, uh, maybe, and I, I, I don't know how long, I know the clippers, for

36:49.800 --> 36:54.360
example, I don't, I forget how long Donald's stringing on them, but they've for so long

36:54.360 --> 36:55.680
were just a horrible team.

36:55.680 --> 37:00.480
I mean, I mean, just one of the worst teams in the NBA, but I guess if you're just strictly

37:00.480 --> 37:06.680
talking about, um, an investment, yet maybe it doesn't even pay, uh, in terms of valuation

37:06.680 --> 37:12.720
to do anything because if you're in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, you, and you're just

37:12.720 --> 37:16.200
there, you, you will just make money and people will show up.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.600
They have a losing suck.

37:17.600 --> 37:22.600
So you want to try to help fly some of this stuff to try to figure out how to win.

37:22.600 --> 37:26.200
If you're going to have to show up every day, you might as well try to win at least.

37:26.200 --> 37:27.200
Yeah.

37:27.200 --> 37:30.080
Well, I, I, I do wonder though if there's some teams like that are like that where they

37:30.080 --> 37:34.400
just, they just, they, it's an investment or vanity thing and they just, I mean, like

37:34.400 --> 37:38.840
the clippers come to mind if you, you know, if you, you, you've been a NBA fan, like, there

37:38.840 --> 37:43.240
was a period for like 10 or 20 years, I think, where they're in Los Angeles and you're

37:43.240 --> 37:45.840
like, how, how can you be this bad?

37:45.840 --> 37:47.520
It's like you're trying to be this bad.

37:47.520 --> 37:53.320
But I guess if you look at the, the clippers when they were sold, there was a, um, pretty

37:53.320 --> 37:54.320
substantial profit.

37:54.320 --> 37:59.960
And so, yeah, that, that, that, that's kind of another, yeah, like sports equivalent of

37:59.960 --> 38:04.600
like a self storage facility, it's like it, yeah, this is our parking lot.

38:04.600 --> 38:09.000
It's like, those are real estate play, it has nothing to do with, uh, actually providing

38:09.000 --> 38:10.000
the service.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.000
Yeah.

38:11.000 --> 38:14.680
So, so yeah, I think, I think the, the, the more interesting part of the story, maybe

38:14.680 --> 38:20.240
that if you look at, um, and I, and I have some, uh, in, in the talk of it, I, I showed

38:20.240 --> 38:22.000
some 3D graphs about this.

38:22.000 --> 38:27.440
But like if you look at some of the cheaper teams, like, uh, I don't know, Dallas or Houston,

38:27.440 --> 38:31.080
and, and you can, you can look at those and go, you know, if you were rich enough to buy

38:31.080 --> 38:36.040
a team, like, that's maybe where you'd want to buy a team is somewhere where they have

38:36.040 --> 38:41.840
lots of wins, but they're, they're very, very low valued versus, if, again, if you cared

38:41.840 --> 38:46.920
about performance, but if you just wanted to make a real estate play, then, yeah, try to

38:46.920 --> 38:52.920
buy, buy low it in, in Los Angeles or, or New York, um, uh, so we've talked about a bunch

38:52.920 --> 38:58.440
of, uh, ideas along these lines, uh, but I'm curious if you've got, uh, if you've got

38:58.440 --> 39:04.560
others in mind, if you're a data scientist practicing hobbyist, whatever, and you're

39:04.560 --> 39:12.840
also interested in sports, uh, what are some areas that you think are ripe for, you

39:12.840 --> 39:14.640
know, experimentation and research?

39:14.640 --> 39:18.960
What do you think folks could go in and have some fun and, and maybe, you know, make an

39:18.960 --> 39:19.960
interesting difference?

39:19.960 --> 39:25.240
Yeah, so I, I do have some off the top of my head. Um, in the last five years, in particular,

39:25.240 --> 39:31.720
I've really gotten into Brazilian Jitsu and, um, got me really interested more in the

39:31.720 --> 39:37.280
UFC, which is because of Brazilian Jitsu is a pretty big component of it. And, uh, one

39:37.280 --> 39:43.800
of things that does seem like it's massively ripe for, uh, data scientists, hobbyist, data

39:43.800 --> 39:50.200
scientists is the, um, machine learning around, um, things like, uh, submissions, for example.

39:50.200 --> 39:56.880
So, you know, uh, what's really interesting is that if you just look and you plot the

39:56.880 --> 40:02.360
submissions, uh, for the last 20 years, I think I have a project right at this. They're,

40:02.360 --> 40:09.360
the career naked choke is number one, one, then, I don't know, it's like arm bar and, uh,

40:09.360 --> 40:14.600
a triangle, you know, a leg triangle are, are, you know, coming next. But what's really

40:14.600 --> 40:19.960
I think could be very interesting is, is, is the chain effective. It, is it, is a

40:19.960 --> 40:25.040
rear naked choke, the best high percentage, um, submission because you started with that

40:25.040 --> 40:29.400
or, or did you start with a bunch of other submissions? And so I, I think there could

40:29.400 --> 40:34.760
be, uh, a lot of interesting things that could happen in terms of, you know, what, what,

40:34.760 --> 40:40.720
what are the chain of submissions that someone would try, uh, and, and are there sequences,

40:40.720 --> 40:45.440
like almost like a, a Pac-Man game. I don't know if you remember the 80s. There was, uh,

40:45.440 --> 40:49.800
maybe I'm too old, but, um, for people to remember this, but there, there, what, I remember

40:49.800 --> 40:54.320
when I was a little kid and, and I used to play Pac-Man. I bought this book. There was

40:54.320 --> 40:59.240
like, how to cheat at Pac-Man. And there was literally a screen that you went through.

40:59.240 --> 41:03.680
And then you could beat every, every screen for a while. Right. And I could, I could think,

41:03.680 --> 41:08.520
I, I could see how in the same thing with Jiu-Jitsu out, maybe there's, there's some moves

41:08.520 --> 41:13.520
that work in certain situations and, uh, sorry, it seems like there's, like, those at the

41:13.520 --> 41:19.040
Konami Code, like, up, up, down, down. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So I, I'll be very curious if,

41:19.040 --> 41:24.240
like, if that, that's, that's one area, um, you know, another one too would, would just

41:24.240 --> 41:28.920
be some of the really interesting statistics that have been generated. Another sports,

41:28.920 --> 41:34.120
like baseball and NBA because they're so popular, you know, those, those things haven't really

41:34.120 --> 41:40.880
been applied to, um, the UFC or Belator, these, these mixed martial arts forums. And so,

41:40.880 --> 41:45.760
you know, even from a financial perspective, uh, I could imagine there could be a lot of

41:45.760 --> 41:50.480
money made by somebody going in and, and really figuring out, you know, who is the best

41:50.480 --> 41:54.960
player or who are the best fighters in the UFC and who are, you know, what are the best

41:54.960 --> 42:00.400
techniques and, um, yeah, I, I think that in particular, there's a, is a, is a, is a

42:00.400 --> 42:06.520
very interesting one. Um, I also think in terms of, um, other sports, like track and field,

42:06.520 --> 42:12.560
I think are, are, are, are also, um, there's, there's some things that, if I was independently

42:12.560 --> 42:17.280
wealthy, I would pursue, like, one of them is, like, what is the optimal amount of training

42:17.280 --> 42:22.080
and what's the best periodization schedule for, let's say track athletes, like a 400 meter

42:22.080 --> 42:27.160
runner or a 200 meter runner. And I, I, I think there's a lot of, uh, ground that can

42:27.160 --> 42:33.800
be covered in, I guess the way I would classify it as like a, a ways for fitness where you,

42:33.800 --> 42:38.080
you have something that's constantly telling you the right thing to do. And, and the thing

42:38.080 --> 42:42.280
that's interesting about the human body is that there, it, it, it's, it's not a linear

42:42.280 --> 42:46.560
relationship. Like, oh, I just exercise more and then I get better. There, there, there,

42:46.560 --> 42:51.040
there's these really complex things that are happening. And, and that's why periodization

42:51.040 --> 42:55.720
is, is so effective as, you know, you do, let's say, a, a really, a strength cycle in,

42:55.720 --> 43:00.360
in, in track, for example, and then go on and during cycle. And, and so I, I think that's

43:00.360 --> 43:05.600
a period that's a, that's a, um, an area where, where machine learning artificial intelligence

43:05.600 --> 43:12.360
can, can play a, a really significant role. And it hasn't, to my knowledge, there, there

43:12.360 --> 43:17.760
hasn't been a lot of traction there. Interesting. I did an interview with, uh, with

43:17.760 --> 43:24.680
Ilka Corjonan, who is a technology VP at first beat, which is the company who, like, they

43:24.680 --> 43:31.680
have their, their models embedded into a lot of the fitness watches, um, for like, doing

43:31.680 --> 43:36.520
analytics on the heartbeat and the heartbeat rate, but they're, but the heartbeat interval,

43:36.520 --> 43:43.200
uh, forget the, the name of the specific acronym. But they do, in addition to their business

43:43.200 --> 43:50.320
where they sell these, you know, models and IP to the watchmakers, they also have this,

43:50.320 --> 43:56.160
like pro athlete training or insight or whatever business where they will apply that data

43:56.160 --> 44:02.240
to, like that, I think their stuff is what allows a lot of the watchmakers to now produce,

44:02.240 --> 44:10.120
like, VO2 max and, and, um, some of these, uh, some of these other metrics off of the

44:10.120 --> 44:14.600
heart rate data from the watches. And the VO2 max, I think, has something to do with,

44:14.600 --> 44:20.800
like, training and rest intervals and stuff like that. Um, so if anyone wants to take on

44:20.800 --> 44:26.600
that challenge, check out, uh, twomal talk number one, oh, six, uh, any other ideas?

44:26.600 --> 44:32.800
You know, I think, I think the other one that's, I guess, somewhat, somewhat related is,

44:32.800 --> 44:38.240
is just in terms of, um, nutrition as well. So my, my background, my undergraduate

44:38.240 --> 44:42.880
degrees in nutritional science, and I still haven't let go of, of a lot of ideas that I

44:42.880 --> 44:48.400
learned. And I, I think another one, again, is, is that I have not seen this yet as,

44:48.400 --> 44:53.960
is machine learning around nutrition. And the closest I've seen is, there's some longitudinal

44:53.960 --> 44:59.360
studies that came out last several years about, I think it was, there's a nurse study

44:59.360 --> 45:05.280
that was 20 or 30 year period where they, they, they showed the predictive power of, of a food

45:05.280 --> 45:11.520
in terms of how much weight you would have. So if you, if you eat more, um, yogurts, you

45:11.520 --> 45:15.080
over a five year period, the more servings of yogurt, you eat the, the lower your body

45:15.080 --> 45:19.520
weight, the more servings of, um, not to eat the lower your body weight, the more servings

45:19.520 --> 45:25.160
of coke, uh, chips, the higher your body weight. And, and so I could see a, again, from just

45:25.160 --> 45:30.520
athletes and just regular people that, um, you know, you could, you could basically have

45:30.520 --> 45:36.360
something that's constantly, again, very non intuitive. And I think this is where AI

45:36.360 --> 45:40.920
comes in. You could, you could, you could basically constantly be telling someone, you,

45:40.920 --> 45:45.720
you can, you could actually have forecast, like, you could forecast based on what somebody's

45:45.720 --> 45:49.080
eating, what they're going to weigh. Right. And so it's certainly not counting calories.

45:49.080 --> 45:52.880
You're not, you're, you're literally just telling someone constantly like, yeah, here's

45:52.880 --> 45:56.760
your, here's your forecast for a year from now based on what I, what I've seen you doing.

45:56.760 --> 46:01.600
So if you want the forecast to go down, you know, you need to be, there's four, here's

46:01.600 --> 46:07.840
four choices. Interesting. Interesting. That makes me think of, um, you know, it'd be cool

46:07.840 --> 46:14.400
to have an app that like you just, and I've seen when, when we were at the peak of the

46:14.400 --> 46:19.520
quantified self thing, I've seen versions of this, but I don't think they had the AI stuff

46:19.520 --> 46:25.840
on the back end and access to all the center data. But an app where you just rate kind

46:25.840 --> 46:31.760
of how you feel on, you know, a handful of dimensions, like physically, mentally, whatever,

46:31.760 --> 46:39.480
happiness. And then it looks at your historical rating patterns, your sleep patterns from

46:39.480 --> 46:44.000
your watch or other, you know, sensors, pillow sensors that they're selling now, all that

46:44.000 --> 46:51.840
kind of stuff, your diet that you put into, uh, your tracking app and just tells you,

46:51.840 --> 46:54.880
you know what, this spaghetti is going to taste really good, but you're going to be

46:54.880 --> 47:00.720
crabby as hell tomorrow or whatever. Um, and just make some simple predictions based on

47:00.720 --> 47:04.640
that or, you know, you're, you know, it's, it's 1130. You, you want to stay up until half

47:04.640 --> 47:08.880
an hour to work on this project or finish this movie or something like that, but you're

47:08.880 --> 47:16.400
going to feel like crap tomorrow. Yeah, I, I, I do think that is the future of AI and

47:16.400 --> 47:21.000
those are the kind of things that I personally am interested in for this next decade of

47:21.000 --> 47:27.000
my life is, is that, that AI assistant where, where it, there are things that are not

47:27.000 --> 47:33.160
easily thought about. The brain is, there's just not good at. And I think things like health,

47:33.160 --> 47:36.840
nutrition, sleep, all, you know, driving, all there's, there's all, there's all these things

47:36.840 --> 47:41.960
where, where algorithms can do it better. So I, I do think that's going to actually be

47:41.960 --> 47:46.280
a significant, uh, impact on humanity in a positive way.

47:46.280 --> 47:55.720
Mm, mm, awesome. Uh, before I let you go, if I may, uh, you are in the final stages of

47:55.720 --> 48:01.080
getting a book out the door, is that right? Yeah. So I, I spent about the last year working

48:01.080 --> 48:08.600
on a book called, uh, Pragmatic AI. Um, and the premise of the book is that, that there's

48:08.600 --> 48:14.360
a lot of AI, like, like many of the conversations we had here that, that is, is very straightforward

48:14.360 --> 48:21.560
and practical and that it should just be done versus, uh, AI is not just self-driving cars

48:21.560 --> 48:28.280
that are fully autonomous and addition that, uh, the cloud plays a big role in, um, in, in

48:28.280 --> 48:32.760
getting things into production. When are you expecting that to hit the shelves?

48:32.760 --> 48:38.440
I think it's June. So I, I'm in technical review this week. So then it goes into production. So,

48:38.440 --> 48:43.880
yeah, I think, I think June, I believe, is when it gets on the shelves. And is it, uh, hands-on,

48:43.880 --> 48:50.120
practical coding kind of book or, you know, this is the opportunity, landscape, higher-level

48:50.120 --> 48:56.600
kind of book? No, super, super hands-on. So, uh, there's examples of, um, doing, you know,

48:56.600 --> 49:00.920
for example, the social media stuff we talked about, there's, there's a whole exploration with code

49:00.920 --> 49:07.080
on that. Um, there's, uh, how to analyze the GitHub project and figure out, you know, what's wrong

49:07.080 --> 49:14.760
with your team. Um, and then there's solutions for AWS, um, Azure, uh, Google Cloud,

49:14.760 --> 49:20.840
TPUs, like, so yeah, very, very, um, hands-on with code examples, mostly in Python, there's a little

49:20.840 --> 49:27.320
bit of R and a lot of Jupyter notebooks. Okay. Oh, very cool. Uh, well, I will, uh, keep an eye out

49:27.320 --> 49:33.880
for that. But I appreciate you taking the time to, to jump on the call and to, to chat with you.

49:33.880 --> 49:38.200
I enjoyed, uh, enjoyed learning about what you're up to. Yeah. Thank you so much for inviting me,

49:38.200 --> 49:43.400
