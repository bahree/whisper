00:00.000 --> 00:12.400
All right, everyone, I am here with Cariann Bergen.

00:12.400 --> 00:16.400
Cariann is an assistant professor at Brown University.

00:16.400 --> 00:19.520
Cariann, welcome to the Twimal AI podcast.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.280
Hi, thanks for having me.

00:21.280 --> 00:25.040
I am looking forward to diving into our conversation.

00:25.040 --> 00:31.120
You have roles in both data science and earth sciences

00:31.120 --> 00:35.840
at Brown, and we'll be talking about that and more.

00:35.840 --> 00:38.960
But to get us started, I'd love to have you share a little bit

00:38.960 --> 00:41.680
about your background and how you came to work

00:41.680 --> 00:45.040
and the confidence of those two fields.

00:45.040 --> 00:48.480
Yeah, so I actually am back at Brown.

00:48.480 --> 00:52.560
I was an undergraduate here a few years ago,

00:52.560 --> 00:55.360
and I studied applied math and physics.

00:55.360 --> 00:57.080
And at the time, I was studying applied math

00:57.080 --> 00:59.400
because I thought, I really liked math and, you know,

00:59.400 --> 01:01.160
in high school and I had taken computer science

01:01.160 --> 01:03.240
and I really liked these kind of topics.

01:03.240 --> 01:05.400
And I thought, math is really useful.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.240
So it'll be fine.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.880
It's a great thing to study.

01:07.880 --> 01:09.760
But I'd never heard the term data science.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.640
Like, I didn't know that it existed.

01:11.640 --> 01:12.920
I just was like, math is useful.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.160
It's everywhere.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.640
So I studied applied math.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.600
And then I graduated and went to work

01:18.600 --> 01:22.200
at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, which is a federally funded research

01:22.200 --> 01:25.760
and development center outside of Boston.

01:25.760 --> 01:28.040
And there I was doing, essentially I came in.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.600
I had an applied math degree.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.600
And they were like, have you ever heard

01:31.600 --> 01:33.840
of any of these neural networks support vector machine

01:33.840 --> 01:36.360
and I had, because I'd taken unapplied statistics course

01:36.360 --> 01:37.680
that covered these things.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.400
And so they gave me this sort of applied machine learning

01:40.400 --> 01:43.760
project trying to look at data from different sensors

01:43.760 --> 01:48.280
and try to determine if there had been a bio agent release

01:48.280 --> 01:51.320
or this kind of thing using sensor data.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.160
And the job title that I had was software engineer.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.200
But I was like, this doesn't feel like software engineering.

01:56.200 --> 01:59.800
I'm kind of prototyping analysis and algorithms in MATLAB.

01:59.800 --> 02:03.840
And so then I decided to go back to school

02:03.840 --> 02:04.360
after that.

02:04.360 --> 02:05.760
I'd never considered doing a PhD.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.080
But I wanted to do kind of an interdisciplinary

02:08.080 --> 02:11.680
more application-focused or sort of engineering-oriented

02:11.680 --> 02:13.480
applied math kind of program.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.080
So I went to Stanford.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.280
And then once I got to Stanford, I

02:16.280 --> 02:19.080
started to hear about data science everywhere.

02:19.080 --> 02:20.880
And I originally thought I was going to do more of like

02:20.880 --> 02:23.000
the, I was in the program that's called computational

02:23.000 --> 02:24.240
mathematical engineering.

02:24.240 --> 02:27.040
So that's kind of traditionally has been more like scientific

02:27.040 --> 02:29.600
computing and computational sciences.

02:29.600 --> 02:32.280
But there was a big shift toward data science.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.760
So I went to Stanford.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.200
Everyone's talking about data science.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.800
If you're doing applied and computational mathematics,

02:37.800 --> 02:40.600
the natural place to apply that is in data science

02:40.600 --> 02:41.320
and machine learning.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.160
So I ended up kind of moving more in that direction

02:44.160 --> 02:45.760
than I had anticipated.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.360
Again, I'd never heard of big data data science

02:48.360 --> 02:50.640
until I went over to Stanford.

02:50.640 --> 02:54.200
And then it was sort of everywhere.

02:54.200 --> 02:58.760
And while I was at Stanford, I got

02:58.760 --> 03:01.160
interested in doing these more applied problems.

03:01.160 --> 03:02.680
Because I do think it's a really interesting way

03:02.680 --> 03:04.560
to find challenging data science problems

03:04.560 --> 03:08.120
as to go talk to scientists or other people who have data

03:08.120 --> 03:10.200
and don't know what to do with it.

03:10.200 --> 03:11.240
They have a problem they want to solve,

03:11.240 --> 03:14.680
but they don't quite know how to get the solution.

03:14.680 --> 03:16.600
And so just by a sort of chance, I

03:16.600 --> 03:18.200
mentioned that as an undergrad, I had taken

03:18.200 --> 03:19.720
a handful of our science courses.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.200
And I thought they were interesting,

03:21.200 --> 03:22.680
but I didn't really see the connection

03:22.680 --> 03:26.280
between our sciences and the kind of mathematics and computing.

03:26.280 --> 03:27.640
But I mentioned this to Professor.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.880
And she introduced me to a seismologist

03:29.880 --> 03:32.840
who had a lot of data.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.080
And so we started collaborating on this project

03:35.080 --> 03:36.880
that ended up becoming my PhD thesis

03:36.880 --> 03:40.720
about trying to detect really small earthquakes

03:40.720 --> 03:44.280
in really long duration waveform recordings

03:44.280 --> 03:46.160
from seismometers, which are the sensors

03:46.160 --> 03:48.360
that measure vibrations of the Earth.

03:48.360 --> 03:51.480
And so I'm trying to pick out really, really small earthquakes.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.080
And so that kind of got me into this feel

03:53.080 --> 03:57.640
of the intersection of data science and geophysics.

03:57.640 --> 04:01.080
And then I sort of continued on in a postdoc position

04:01.080 --> 04:05.000
and ended up applying to faculty positions

04:05.000 --> 04:07.440
and ended up back at Brown, where

04:07.440 --> 04:09.880
I was hired by the Data Science Initiative, which

04:09.880 --> 04:12.680
is one of these kind of interdisciplinary homes

04:12.680 --> 04:16.200
for data science at Brown, with a joint appointment

04:16.200 --> 04:18.680
in Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences,

04:18.680 --> 04:21.600
which is a different department than the one I was in here

04:21.600 --> 04:24.520
as an undergrad, but it was kind of fun to come back.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.760
My opinion is Brown undergraduates are the most fun

04:26.760 --> 04:28.560
and greatest undergraduates in the world,

04:28.560 --> 04:29.560
the best ones to work with.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.520
So I was excited to come back and teach them

04:31.520 --> 04:33.520
and work with them again.

04:33.520 --> 04:37.000
And so I was excited to come back to Brown.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.880
I also have a courtesy appointment in computer science.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.680
So I hopefully will be able to start working

04:40.680 --> 04:43.120
with some computer science students as well.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.120
I just started this year.

04:44.120 --> 04:46.400
So I'm still new to Brown.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.920
But yeah, it's fun to be back.

04:49.920 --> 04:50.440
Fantastic.

04:50.440 --> 04:54.720
Do you anticipate continuing on?

04:54.720 --> 04:57.680
Well, I guess you're partially appointed

04:57.680 --> 04:59.720
in Earth and Environmental Sciences.

04:59.720 --> 05:03.360
So you're going to continue on with research building

05:03.360 --> 05:05.320
on your dissertation.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.120
Is that the idea?

05:06.120 --> 05:06.400
Yeah.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.640
So there's definitely one aspect of the research

05:09.640 --> 05:11.440
that I'm going to continue to do.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.320
I have some collaborations that are hopefully,

05:14.320 --> 05:15.960
it's a little tricky during the pandemic

05:15.960 --> 05:18.040
to keep these collaborations with scientists going

05:18.040 --> 05:20.920
and kick off new ones as a new assistant professor.

05:20.920 --> 05:24.760
He started during transition institutions during this time.

05:24.760 --> 05:26.320
But hopefully to continue collaborating

05:26.320 --> 05:29.000
with people who are doing earthquake science,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.840
I have a current project I'm working on,

05:31.840 --> 05:34.080
where I'm trying to work on a similar problem,

05:34.080 --> 05:36.720
which is also this kind of waveform classification

05:36.720 --> 05:39.800
and classifying the data that are recorded by seismograms.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.760
But trying to do so in a way that's a little more interpretable.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.560
So I do have interest in those kind of projects.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.640
And in general, sort of signal processing event detection

05:48.640 --> 05:52.040
and sensor networks are problems that I've worked on.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.120
Actually, that's what I was doing.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.800
Also at Lincoln Laboratory was a problem

05:54.800 --> 05:58.720
with detecting sort of rare events in a sensor network.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.520
I'm doing kind of the same with earthquakes.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.880
So that's an area of interest.

06:02.880 --> 06:04.920
But also moving more towards looking

06:04.920 --> 06:08.480
at other kinds of applications and thinking more about,

06:08.480 --> 06:11.160
how do we do machine learning through in the right way

06:11.160 --> 06:12.800
and the sciences and developing tools

06:12.800 --> 06:16.480
that are specifically designed for scientists

06:16.480 --> 06:18.840
as opposed to kind of taking techniques from industry

06:18.840 --> 06:21.320
and adapting them, which is what I did during my PhD.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.040
We were using these kind of audio processing techniques,

06:24.040 --> 06:27.080
applying it to seismic data, and sometimes that works.

06:27.080 --> 06:28.720
But sometimes scientists need tools

06:28.720 --> 06:30.080
that are specifically designed

06:30.080 --> 06:33.280
with their sort of domain expertise, knowledge

06:33.280 --> 06:36.360
of this sort of underlying, you know,

06:36.360 --> 06:39.320
domain knowledge, the physics, and all of that as well.

06:39.320 --> 06:42.200
So there's a lot of I think needs that scientists have

06:42.200 --> 06:44.160
that are not necessarily being addressed

06:44.160 --> 06:47.280
by some of the research that's going on

06:47.280 --> 06:50.680
that's more industry focused in many cases.

06:50.680 --> 06:55.240
But digging into the work that you did on the dissertation,

06:55.240 --> 06:58.600
you mentioned you were applying audio techniques

06:58.600 --> 07:00.320
or techniques from audio processing,

07:00.320 --> 07:02.440
were they machine learning techniques

07:02.440 --> 07:07.440
or traditional audio processing techniques or a mixture?

07:07.440 --> 07:09.000
Yeah, so it's kind of a mixture.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.600
So we were doing trying to detect the signals

07:12.600 --> 07:15.360
from these weak earthquakes in a sort of unsupervised way.

07:15.360 --> 07:18.600
So in a lot of science applications,

07:18.600 --> 07:19.680
I think the sciences in general

07:19.680 --> 07:21.440
is common to have really big data sets,

07:21.440 --> 07:23.600
but you don't always have like labels for them

07:23.600 --> 07:25.200
or very good set of labels.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.640
And especially if your goal is to find something new,

07:27.640 --> 07:29.080
then, you know, the label data

07:29.080 --> 07:31.680
you have may not be helpful for finding

07:31.680 --> 07:34.080
and discovering new things in the data.

07:34.080 --> 07:35.400
So we wanted to develop something

07:35.400 --> 07:39.680
that we would be able to discover new earthquake signals

07:39.680 --> 07:40.920
in these continuous data sets

07:40.920 --> 07:44.000
without having to have a lot of labeled data.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.360
And this continues to be a need in this field

07:47.360 --> 07:48.520
because label data is something

07:48.520 --> 07:50.000
that people often don't have.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.120
And so we were using more of a data mining approach.

07:52.120 --> 07:55.240
So we are trying to look for repeating patterns

07:55.240 --> 07:57.520
in the data as a way of picking out earthquake signals

07:57.520 --> 07:59.520
because earthquakes often repeat.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.520
When I started the project,

08:00.520 --> 08:01.800
I didn't realize the seismograms.

08:01.800 --> 08:02.800
You see, if you've ever seen one,

08:02.800 --> 08:04.880
they're like, look at these kind of wiggles.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.200
And to me, I thought they just were really random.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.200
I didn't know that there is a lot of information

08:09.200 --> 08:10.200
that's sort of in there.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.200
But if you have two earthquakes

08:11.200 --> 08:13.040
that are roughly the same location

08:13.040 --> 08:15.520
and they're recorded by the same instrument,

08:15.520 --> 08:17.440
then the wiggles that are recorded for that,

08:17.440 --> 08:18.840
they look almost identical.

08:18.840 --> 08:21.840
And so you can use that as a way to pick out earthquakes.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.640
If you know what one of the signals looks like,

08:23.640 --> 08:27.240
you can essentially use that as a sort of template

08:27.240 --> 08:29.680
and find other events that were roughly the same location.

08:29.680 --> 08:32.000
And so that's called template matching

08:32.000 --> 08:34.440
and that's a commonly used approach in that field.

08:34.440 --> 08:35.720
So we were trying to do template matching

08:35.720 --> 08:37.960
without template sort of template discovery

08:37.960 --> 08:40.360
by looking for these kind of repeating signals.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.560
And so we were using techniques that you would use

08:42.560 --> 08:44.440
for like audio retrieval

08:44.440 --> 08:47.400
because the waveform data we have in seismology,

08:47.400 --> 08:50.560
the sort of best or most similar kind of data

08:50.560 --> 08:53.040
that's out there that there's been a lot of tools for

08:53.040 --> 08:54.880
is audio.

08:54.880 --> 08:56.960
There's obviously some differences between the two types,

08:56.960 --> 09:01.480
but sort of searching large audio data sets

09:01.480 --> 09:05.800
for you know sort of repeating segments

09:05.800 --> 09:08.080
is something that there were techniques.

09:08.080 --> 09:10.520
And so we were using in particular localities

09:10.520 --> 09:12.200
instead of passing was the technique

09:12.200 --> 09:13.960
we were using to kind of cluster

09:13.960 --> 09:16.360
and find do kind of a near neighbor search

09:16.360 --> 09:18.360
to find similar waveforms.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.120
And then another piece of it is,

09:20.120 --> 09:21.800
then a piece that's different from audio

09:21.800 --> 09:23.760
is then what do you do when you have multiple sensors

09:23.760 --> 09:24.800
at different locations?

09:24.800 --> 09:27.800
And so that was a big focus of my work.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.520
And so with that's again under the hood,

09:29.520 --> 09:31.160
there was some sort of machine learning going on

09:31.160 --> 09:32.880
like some basic, you know, some clustering,

09:32.880 --> 09:33.960
these kinds of things.

09:35.120 --> 09:39.480
But yeah, it was kind of an interesting project

09:39.480 --> 09:42.480
just because it was really combining a lot of different

09:42.480 --> 09:44.880
tools and really, it was a very, very, you know,

09:44.880 --> 09:48.600
multidisciplinary and really fun.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.160
We had a team of people from,

09:50.160 --> 09:52.640
I was sort of the data science person

09:52.640 --> 09:54.480
and we had some seismologists involved.

09:54.480 --> 09:57.000
We had some computer scientists involved as well.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.080
So we had people from, you know,

09:58.080 --> 10:01.040
three different academic units all involved in the project.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.680
So that was good and fun.

10:03.680 --> 10:07.840
Well, when you mentioned that the signal,

10:07.840 --> 10:12.840
if you record two seismic events from the same location,

10:13.520 --> 10:18.360
the signals will be identical as the implication

10:18.360 --> 10:21.800
that if you're in a different location

10:21.800 --> 10:23.720
that the signals won't be identical

10:23.720 --> 10:28.720
and that kind of speaks to me to some of the challenges

10:29.040 --> 10:32.360
of using machine learning, you know,

10:32.360 --> 10:35.000
might be that you can train a model,

10:35.000 --> 10:37.440
but it's very location specific

10:37.440 --> 10:41.040
and doesn't necessarily generalize to other locations.

10:41.040 --> 10:42.720
Is that one of the things you see?

10:42.720 --> 10:44.840
Yeah, so for this particular project,

10:44.840 --> 10:47.040
it is true that so the reason why you would see similar

10:47.040 --> 10:49.200
signals that are coming from events

10:49.200 --> 10:52.880
that have the sort of same or close nearby sources

10:52.880 --> 10:54.440
and then recorded at the same location

10:54.440 --> 10:57.360
is that essentially the source is the same in that case

10:57.360 --> 10:58.800
because you have sort of slip along a fault

10:58.800 --> 11:00.480
at roughly the same location.

11:00.480 --> 11:01.680
Then you have the seismic waves

11:01.680 --> 11:03.600
are traveling the same path

11:03.600 --> 11:05.120
and then they're recorded at the same location.

11:05.120 --> 11:06.280
So everything's kind of the same

11:06.280 --> 11:07.640
all of these pieces that contribute

11:07.640 --> 11:08.800
to what the waveform looks like,

11:08.800 --> 11:11.120
but if you have a different location.

11:11.120 --> 11:15.320
I thought you were referring to multiple earthquakes,

11:15.320 --> 11:17.960
you know, separated by time.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.120
Captured from the same location.

11:20.120 --> 11:20.960
Oh, yeah, they are,

11:20.960 --> 11:23.360
but if they might be having at the same location

11:23.360 --> 11:24.200
along the fault.

11:24.200 --> 11:28.640
So they would be separated by, you know, minutes,

11:28.640 --> 11:30.840
years, you know, the amount of time

11:30.840 --> 11:34.360
could be pretty much any amount of time.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.040
We were processing data sets up to 10 years.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.960
So up to 10 years of time,

11:37.960 --> 11:40.520
we would look for those,

11:40.520 --> 11:42.160
but they would have to be roughly

11:42.160 --> 11:45.600
at the same location and recorded at the same instrument.

11:45.600 --> 11:47.720
But in terms of generalization,

11:47.720 --> 11:49.880
now they're actually in the last,

11:49.880 --> 11:50.960
I would say about three years,

11:50.960 --> 11:53.440
which is around the time I finished up my PhD.

11:53.440 --> 11:54.560
There has been a shift

11:54.560 --> 11:57.520
toward using supervised approaches for this.

11:57.520 --> 12:00.480
And there are general characteristics of earthquakes.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.880
So you have this sort of initial wave arrival,

12:02.880 --> 12:03.960
which is called a P wave

12:03.960 --> 12:06.000
and then you have another sort of major arrival

12:06.000 --> 12:07.240
called an S wave.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.360
And you have all these different,

12:08.360 --> 12:09.800
they call them seismic phases.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.080
And so you can see these,

12:11.080 --> 12:12.880
they have some patterns in the data

12:12.880 --> 12:15.880
that seismologists can learn to identify them

12:15.880 --> 12:17.600
by looking at the waveform data.

12:17.600 --> 12:21.600
They can look at some of these seismic recordings

12:21.600 --> 12:22.960
and they can say, okay, that's a P wave,

12:22.960 --> 12:24.680
that's an S wave and all that.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.440
So you can also train a machine learning model to do this.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.440
If you have a large labeled data set,

12:29.440 --> 12:32.120
which that's something that,

12:32.120 --> 12:33.440
as a student, I was frustrated by

12:33.440 --> 12:34.600
because there weren't these large

12:34.600 --> 12:35.960
labeled data sets in this field.

12:35.960 --> 12:36.960
And I kept saying,

12:36.960 --> 12:38.880
if we want to use supervised learning,

12:38.880 --> 12:40.320
then we are going to have to put together

12:40.320 --> 12:41.240
this kind of data set.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.400
And so a few years ago,

12:42.400 --> 12:46.400
there was sort of a push for that to happen.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.000
And now there are some of these data sets.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.280
And so there has been a movement towards supervised learning.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.360
And it does work fairly well.

12:52.360 --> 12:54.960
They do tend to generalize well

12:54.960 --> 12:56.000
from different locations

12:56.000 --> 12:57.760
because you do have these kind of general,

12:57.760 --> 13:00.960
like P wave and S waves patterns

13:00.960 --> 13:03.360
that you can train a seismologist to pick them out.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.200
So training and machine learning algorithm

13:05.200 --> 13:08.920
is, it's very feasible to do.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.320
But this only works for the kind of earthquakes

13:11.320 --> 13:12.840
that we have a lot of examples of

13:12.840 --> 13:15.360
in the catalogs and more conventional earthquakes.

13:15.360 --> 13:17.920
There's still a lot of demand for

13:17.920 --> 13:22.320
these more unsupervised or kind of data limited methods

13:22.320 --> 13:24.000
for other kinds of events.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.120
So there's lots of different kinds of seismic events

13:27.120 --> 13:28.800
that people are interested in.

13:28.800 --> 13:29.840
There's things like tremor,

13:29.840 --> 13:32.880
which is another kind of sort of seismic event.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.120
People also study environmental events,

13:35.120 --> 13:37.840
like those study ice quakes or landslides

13:37.840 --> 13:40.080
or avalanches, these kind of things.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.800
And there's also seismometer on Mars.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.680
So if you're trying to, you know, this,

13:43.680 --> 13:45.840
you can train a model to detect earthquakes on Earth.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.160
But if you try to apply it to Mars, like, you know,

13:48.160 --> 13:50.000
all bets are off, and that's a case

13:50.000 --> 13:51.520
where you don't have a lot of examples.

13:51.520 --> 13:54.400
You don't really know what you're gonna find.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.280
So there are, you know, there's,

13:56.280 --> 13:59.520
there has been this movement towards supervised learning,

13:59.520 --> 14:01.720
but it's only for those cases

14:01.720 --> 14:04.640
where you can put together a large label data set.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.320
But it does, it does work well for those problems.

14:07.320 --> 14:09.760
Do we call them earthquakes if they're on Mars?

14:09.760 --> 14:12.760
You would call them probably a Mars quake, I guess.

14:12.760 --> 14:15.000
I don't know, I haven't looked so much at the,

14:15.000 --> 14:16.400
I've seen some of the data for it,

14:16.400 --> 14:18.720
but when I look at it, it doesn't look like anything to me.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.120
I've sort of learned, I've learned, you know,

14:20.120 --> 14:24.320
I'm sort of a human, I've done my sort of human machine,

14:24.320 --> 14:27.680
you know, learning and learned how to identify,

14:27.680 --> 14:29.480
sort of P and S waves and pick out earthquakes.

14:29.480 --> 14:30.800
But if I look at the Martian ones,

14:30.800 --> 14:32.000
it doesn't look like anything to me,

14:32.000 --> 14:33.320
which is why I don't think machine learning

14:33.320 --> 14:34.800
would be able to pick them out either

14:34.800 --> 14:36.200
if they were trained on Earth.

14:36.200 --> 14:39.080
And so you mentioned that an as an element

14:39.080 --> 14:44.080
of your project was trying to incorporate data

14:44.120 --> 14:45.480
from multiple locations.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.240
Yeah, so what I was trying to do is one of the challenges

14:48.240 --> 14:51.080
with our approach of trying to look for repeating signals

14:51.080 --> 14:54.600
is that other things can generate repeating signals.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.240
Like if you have the same truck

14:56.240 --> 14:58.360
that drives past the sensor every day,

14:58.360 --> 15:00.960
then you may get a repeating signal from that.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.360
And so there's kind of two places

15:02.360 --> 15:07.360
where you can try to suppress those kinds of false detections.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.520
And one of them is kind of on the front end,

15:09.520 --> 15:11.960
you can try to choose features where you're not going to see,

15:11.960 --> 15:14.520
you know, maybe that's not in the right frequency range

15:14.520 --> 15:16.640
or something that don't look like earthquakes.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.440
But you also can try to do it on kind of the output side

15:19.440 --> 15:22.040
and say like which of these signals are consistent

15:22.040 --> 15:23.520
with being an earthquake.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.200
And one thing that you can try to do

15:25.200 --> 15:26.720
is use machine learning to classify those.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.120
But actually what works best is to look at the physics

15:29.120 --> 15:32.240
and say are we seeing something that's consistent

15:32.240 --> 15:35.280
with a single event where you have a waveform propagating

15:35.280 --> 15:38.520
in space and it's being recorded on different sensors

15:38.520 --> 15:41.400
in a way that's consistent with a shared event.

15:41.400 --> 15:45.040
And so that's a problem that generally when you do detection

15:45.040 --> 15:47.840
in this field, you first pick out what you think are earthquakes

15:47.840 --> 15:49.120
and then you look at different sensors

15:49.120 --> 15:51.360
and say are we seeing the same event.

15:51.360 --> 15:54.960
But the waveforms they arrive at different stations

15:54.960 --> 15:57.800
at different times because they travel,

15:57.800 --> 15:59.640
they don't travel instantly.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.440
So they hit the stations at different times.

16:01.440 --> 16:03.160
You actually try to make sense of this

16:03.160 --> 16:05.680
and like are these arrivals we're observing

16:05.680 --> 16:09.240
at different locations consistent with a shared event.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.280
And that problem is something they call phase association

16:11.280 --> 16:12.120
in this field.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.880
And so for our particular detector,

16:14.880 --> 16:16.880
one of the parts of the project that I worked on

16:16.880 --> 16:19.800
there's been a lot of time on was trying to come up

16:19.800 --> 16:22.440
with a method to do that for multiple stations

16:22.440 --> 16:23.720
for our particular approach.

16:24.760 --> 16:28.120
And it turns out that because we're doing our detections

16:28.120 --> 16:30.080
we're identifying similar events,

16:30.080 --> 16:31.680
there's an invariant quantity we can use

16:31.680 --> 16:33.680
to that we see across the network

16:33.680 --> 16:36.600
that we can identify and pull them out.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.480
So the problem just actually sort of reduces

16:38.480 --> 16:41.040
the problem of finding these kind of patterns

16:41.040 --> 16:43.400
in a giant sparse matrix, which was the output

16:43.400 --> 16:44.640
of our detector.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.480
And so kind of doing this like clustering,

16:47.480 --> 16:49.640
finding these kind of specific cluster shapes

16:49.640 --> 16:51.480
and patterns in this matrix.

16:51.480 --> 16:55.600
And that technique or you mentioned location invariant

16:55.600 --> 16:58.000
hashing, is that what you call that?

16:58.000 --> 17:01.120
So sorry, locality sensitive hashing is a technique

17:01.120 --> 17:02.840
from like theoretical computer science

17:02.840 --> 17:05.720
for fast near neighbor search.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.800
And so that's what we use to pick out the waveforms

17:08.800 --> 17:10.400
that are similar to each other.

17:10.400 --> 17:12.680
And then once we do that for each of the instruments

17:12.680 --> 17:15.160
in our network, then we have to ask the question of like

17:15.160 --> 17:19.440
which of these pairs of events that we are seeing

17:19.440 --> 17:21.960
do we believe are real and that we're seeing

17:21.960 --> 17:23.960
at multiple stations?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.320
Because we see it in multiple stations

17:25.320 --> 17:27.160
and we think it's probably not just like a truck driving

17:27.160 --> 17:30.960
by one station or some other sort of nuisance signal

17:30.960 --> 17:32.400
we think it's really an earthquake

17:32.400 --> 17:35.760
if it's consistent with being observed over a larger

17:35.760 --> 17:36.840
spatial area.

17:36.840 --> 17:41.120
And so does the technique result at,

17:41.120 --> 17:44.440
is it a technique that an analyst or someone

17:44.440 --> 17:47.320
could apply or would apply to the data

17:47.320 --> 17:49.480
to help them make sense of it?

17:49.480 --> 17:53.560
Or does it feed into some machinery

17:53.560 --> 17:57.080
that you, like a classifier that ultimately says,

17:57.080 --> 17:59.520
this was an earthquake, this wasn't an earthquake?

17:59.520 --> 18:01.960
Yeah, so our approach is essentially

18:01.960 --> 18:03.920
trying to just detect the signals.

18:03.920 --> 18:06.440
So usually if the processing steps,

18:06.440 --> 18:08.600
what a seismologist would ultimately want

18:08.600 --> 18:10.440
would be to get a catalog of events.

18:10.440 --> 18:11.720
And so what they would usually do

18:11.720 --> 18:15.040
is take the events that are seen on multiple stations,

18:15.040 --> 18:17.320
they would try to then use, look at,

18:17.320 --> 18:19.240
identify the specific arrival times

18:19.240 --> 18:21.240
that each station of the P and S wave

18:21.240 --> 18:23.600
so these different phases.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.720
And then use that to try to locate where the event is

18:26.720 --> 18:28.720
and if you can sort of locate the event,

18:28.720 --> 18:30.640
that's when it's usually kind of put in a catalog

18:30.640 --> 18:31.840
and you could also characterize it,

18:31.840 --> 18:32.960
like how big was the event?

18:32.960 --> 18:36.000
What was the magnitude, maybe information

18:36.000 --> 18:37.240
about the source and so on?

18:37.240 --> 18:39.360
So that's kind of what the next step

18:39.360 --> 18:42.320
would be to locate and characterize the event

18:42.320 --> 18:43.920
and then put it in a catalog.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.560
And these catalogs are used by,

18:45.560 --> 18:48.280
this is sort of the starting point of a lot of research

18:48.280 --> 18:51.240
in geophysics and earthquake sciences.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.840
They want to have good catalogs of earthquakes

18:53.840 --> 18:55.840
so that they can then look for patterns

18:55.840 --> 18:58.520
or draw conclusions based on when and where

18:58.520 --> 19:01.360
they're seeing earthquakes and these kinds of things.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.720
You know, the people who are sort of trying to study

19:02.720 --> 19:04.600
like the physics of earthquakes and these kinds of things,

19:04.600 --> 19:06.960
they need to know where and when earthquakes happen.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.640
So on my end, I'm trying to help create

19:09.640 --> 19:12.880
that sort of data product for the scientists.

19:12.880 --> 19:16.640
And how would you characterize kind of where we are broadly

19:16.640 --> 19:21.640
with the application of machine learning to the field?

19:21.960 --> 19:25.680
Well, this particular problem of identifying earthquakes

19:25.680 --> 19:30.680
and seismological events and more broadly to earth sciences.

19:34.720 --> 19:36.480
Yeah, so this particular problem

19:36.480 --> 19:40.800
of doing this sort of waveform classification,

19:40.800 --> 19:42.480
this kind of seismic data analysis,

19:42.480 --> 19:44.120
it's really on kind of the front end

19:44.120 --> 19:46.920
of getting these catalogs.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.080
This is one of the problems that's,

19:48.080 --> 19:49.520
it's been studied for a long time.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.040
And it's also one of the areas I think within geophysics

19:52.040 --> 19:53.360
where there's been a lot more focus

19:53.360 --> 19:54.640
on applying machine learning

19:54.640 --> 19:57.200
because it's a problem that seems really well suited

19:57.200 --> 19:58.000
to machine learning.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.800
Like you have all of this data,

19:59.800 --> 20:03.320
you have some catalogs for some kinds of events

20:03.320 --> 20:04.840
and you want to be able to do better

20:04.840 --> 20:08.040
to do a better job of picking out the earthquakes,

20:08.040 --> 20:09.800
identifying when the arrivals are,

20:09.800 --> 20:13.080
getting the smallest events that we can and so on.

20:13.080 --> 20:15.040
And so that area I think there's been,

20:15.040 --> 20:16.440
there has been a lot of work on it.

20:16.440 --> 20:19.320
And I think it's actually starting to get incorporated

20:19.320 --> 20:22.160
into some of the like real time processing.

20:22.160 --> 20:25.440
So the tools that I was developing was more for researchers.

20:25.440 --> 20:28.240
So it was more geared towards like batch processing

20:28.240 --> 20:30.200
of large quantities of archive data.

20:30.200 --> 20:33.000
So we would apply it to like the last 10 years of data

20:33.000 --> 20:37.520
recorded in a particular region or set of stations.

20:37.520 --> 20:40.440
But there's also people who are like the US Geological Survey

20:40.440 --> 20:45.320
that are doing this kind of real time catalog generation.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.600
And so we were trying to develop,

20:46.600 --> 20:48.920
you know, more detailed catalogs for researchers.

20:48.920 --> 20:50.280
But there also was an interest in like,

20:50.280 --> 20:55.000
well, if we could just incorporate it into these kind of systems

20:55.000 --> 20:57.880
that are already generating the catalogs then

20:57.880 --> 21:00.680
and have better catalogs in the first place,

21:00.680 --> 21:02.720
I think that's an area where there is a lot of interest

21:02.720 --> 21:04.760
in including machine learning.

21:04.760 --> 21:05.960
One of the challenges there is just, you know,

21:05.960 --> 21:07.760
the USGS is public facing, right?

21:07.760 --> 21:09.160
So I think there are a little more,

21:09.160 --> 21:11.240
you know, risk averse in terms of like what,

21:11.240 --> 21:14.640
what how many, you know, false positives can you put

21:14.640 --> 21:16.200
or how accurate you need it to be

21:16.200 --> 21:19.560
as opposed to the catalogs researchers are working with.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.720
You know, they want to find everything they possibly can

21:21.720 --> 21:25.480
and then worry about later kind of some of these other issues

21:25.480 --> 21:28.640
about like the data quality or these kind of things.

21:28.640 --> 21:29.480
So.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.760
And so from your introduction,

21:32.760 --> 21:39.760
it sounds like your experience applying machine learning

21:39.760 --> 21:44.960
to this particular field of seismology kind of in form.

21:44.960 --> 21:51.440
Some, you know, some thoughts on kind of machine learning

21:51.440 --> 21:54.840
in general as applied to the scientists.

21:54.840 --> 21:57.920
You know, how do you think we're doing there?

21:57.920 --> 21:59.800
Yeah.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.680
So actually when I finished up this project,

22:02.680 --> 22:04.440
one of the things that I did was,

22:04.440 --> 22:05.880
as I was writing up my thesis,

22:05.880 --> 22:07.600
I like had all these kind of thoughts about like,

22:07.600 --> 22:08.680
well, how could machine learning,

22:08.680 --> 22:11.400
how could scientists better incorporate machine learning?

22:11.400 --> 22:13.880
And I sort of wrote this up and we ended up publishing

22:13.880 --> 22:16.920
like a review paper that include these kind of suggestions

22:16.920 --> 22:18.800
for the scientific community.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.240
But at the same time, I was kind of thinking about

22:20.240 --> 22:24.320
as a data scientist, like what do I see is sort of missing here.

22:24.320 --> 22:27.440
And I think right now there's a lot of focus like among scientists.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.920
There's a lot of interest in using machine learning.

22:29.920 --> 22:33.120
But for scientists, machine learning is just a set of tools

22:33.120 --> 22:34.920
that they don't necessarily,

22:34.920 --> 22:37.480
I mean, some of the, you know, younger scientists

22:37.480 --> 22:39.800
are really keen to learn more computer science

22:39.800 --> 22:41.680
to learn the data science techniques.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.240
But a lot of people are just sort of like,

22:43.240 --> 22:45.200
you know, give me this, you know, neural network,

22:45.200 --> 22:47.280
I'll just apply it to my data, get some results,

22:47.280 --> 22:48.640
and then, you know, move on,

22:48.640 --> 22:51.200
they're really motivated by the scientific questions.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.320
And not necessarily thinking about like, you know,

22:53.320 --> 22:55.680
how do I modify this technique to get it to work better

22:55.680 --> 22:58.480
or is this technique, you know, well suited to the problem

22:58.480 --> 23:00.520
or how could I incorporate domain knowledge better

23:00.520 --> 23:01.360
into this model?

23:01.360 --> 23:05.080
It's, you know, it's just, it's not the focus of their work.

23:05.080 --> 23:07.280
They're just, you know, they want a set of tools

23:07.280 --> 23:09.000
that they can kind of grab and go.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.640
And on the, I think, computer science side,

23:11.640 --> 23:14.320
a lot of the research there is driven by,

23:14.320 --> 23:15.920
you know, the needs of industry

23:15.920 --> 23:18.360
and certain kinds of data like text or images

23:18.360 --> 23:20.240
and these kinds of data sets,

23:20.240 --> 23:22.200
which often look different than the data sets

23:22.200 --> 23:23.640
that scientists have.

23:23.640 --> 23:26.120
And often there's sort of different assumptions

23:26.120 --> 23:31.120
about, you know, the needs and just the interest

23:31.880 --> 23:35.240
of scientists, I think, is often a little bit different.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.160
You know, things like knowing how confident

23:37.160 --> 23:38.240
they could be in their predictions,

23:38.240 --> 23:40.720
being able to interpret models and understand,

23:40.720 --> 23:42.360
you know, what's going on under the hood

23:42.360 --> 23:44.440
is something that's really important for scientists

23:44.440 --> 23:47.520
being able to use whatever machine learning models they have

23:47.520 --> 23:50.200
to then discover something new about science

23:50.200 --> 23:52.960
is really the, the ultimate sort of focus.

23:52.960 --> 23:56.360
And so I think there's not a lot as many people

23:56.360 --> 23:58.960
who are in this kind of, in between space,

23:58.960 --> 24:02.240
there's kind of the scientists who are using machine learning

24:02.240 --> 24:06.800
tools but not focused too much on developing new tools

24:06.800 --> 24:08.840
and then you have computer scientists who, you know,

24:08.840 --> 24:10.520
they might be interested in applying their tools

24:10.520 --> 24:13.400
to scientific data but not necessarily really digging

24:13.400 --> 24:16.640
into like learning more about the domain in order

24:16.640 --> 24:19.960
to make really like tailored tools for the scientists.

24:19.960 --> 24:22.640
And so I sort of think of it as a little bit of an analogy

24:22.640 --> 24:24.200
with like computational biology.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.000
You have this field where you have people

24:26.000 --> 24:28.240
who are essentially a sort of trained as computer scientists

24:28.240 --> 24:30.920
but they really learn a lot of the biology

24:30.920 --> 24:33.760
and then they're able to develop tools specifically

24:33.760 --> 24:36.000
for working with biological data

24:36.000 --> 24:38.680
for solving computational problems in biology.

24:38.680 --> 24:41.400
And I think for our scientists and for some

24:41.400 --> 24:42.920
of other, the other physical sciences,

24:42.920 --> 24:44.520
we don't really have that notion of this

24:44.520 --> 24:46.080
as kind of a distinct discipline

24:46.080 --> 24:48.280
that we're training students in and have

24:48.280 --> 24:50.600
as its kind of own research field.

24:50.600 --> 24:54.440
And so that's what I'm kind of hoping to work in that space

24:54.440 --> 24:58.320
and to try to build up and train students to work in that area.

24:58.320 --> 25:00.160
But it's kind of a new and growing area

25:00.160 --> 25:02.920
and you know, fields like computational biology took time

25:02.920 --> 25:04.200
to sort of grow and develop.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.840
And I think, in our sciences, I think we're a little behind

25:06.840 --> 25:08.600
but there are some areas I see a lot of work

25:08.600 --> 25:12.480
in like climate science where I think they're really far ahead.

25:12.480 --> 25:14.200
There's a lot of people who've been doing climate modeling.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.840
I think they're really computer savvy over there

25:16.840 --> 25:21.040
and like a lot of them are keen to adopt machine learning.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.560
Geophysics is also a very sort of,

25:23.560 --> 25:26.800
I was a geophysics is full of data scientists, you know,

25:26.800 --> 25:28.920
from before we were calling them data scientists.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.720
Like they've always had a lot of data,

25:30.720 --> 25:34.840
a lot of very high demand for computational solutions

25:34.840 --> 25:37.480
for analyzing big data sets.

25:37.480 --> 25:41.280
But the focus hasn't always been on, you know,

25:41.280 --> 25:43.800
looking to sort of modern tools from computer science.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.280
A lot of us sort of brute forcing things

25:45.280 --> 25:47.680
like just throwing a lot of compute at the problem

25:47.680 --> 25:48.960
and not thinking about how to, you know,

25:48.960 --> 25:50.520
carefully design the algorithms

25:50.520 --> 25:54.160
or really digging into the different statistical

25:54.160 --> 25:57.200
or sort of computational methods as much.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.680
Of course, there's always, there's always people

25:58.680 --> 26:00.640
in every field who have these interests.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.680
So I'm not like the first person who's ever,

26:02.680 --> 26:04.080
ever been in this intersection.

26:04.080 --> 26:06.320
But I think it's an area, there's a lot of growing interests.

26:06.320 --> 26:09.960
I hear from a lot of, you know, young scientists,

26:09.960 --> 26:11.440
early career folks who were interested

26:11.440 --> 26:12.720
in going into this area.

26:12.720 --> 26:15.840
And so it's an area that I'm hoping to develop more

26:15.840 --> 26:18.280
in my research, rather than kind of focusing on

26:18.280 --> 26:22.320
like this one particular problem of picking out earthquake signals,

26:22.320 --> 26:23.480
which is an interesting problem.

26:23.480 --> 26:26.680
But I think there's a lot more that we could do

26:26.680 --> 26:29.120
in this intersection, especially developing new tools.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.520
Like I think that's kind of the most, the most fun.

26:32.520 --> 26:36.320
And do you have a sense for the direction that that goes

26:36.320 --> 26:40.520
or specific tools that you think are needed?

26:40.520 --> 26:44.320
And maybe how domain specific are the new tools?

26:44.320 --> 26:47.200
Do you think there's an opportunity to create, you know,

26:47.200 --> 26:51.400
ML tools, you know, broadly for scientists?

26:51.400 --> 26:54.840
Or does that run the risk of kind of the same problem

26:54.840 --> 26:56.080
that you're trying to solve

26:56.080 --> 26:59.240
and what the tools aren't specific enough?

26:59.240 --> 27:00.840
Yeah, I mean, I think that's a good question, right?

27:00.840 --> 27:02.720
Because there is this sort of tradeoff, like the more kind

27:02.720 --> 27:06.080
of general purpose tool you make, like the more different problems

27:06.080 --> 27:09.000
you can apply it to and get like decent solutions.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.480
But then for any given problem,

27:10.480 --> 27:13.800
it's probably not going to be the best possible solution.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.600
So I think, but there are kinds of data,

27:15.600 --> 27:18.480
like I've been working with these, you know, seismic signals.

27:18.480 --> 27:20.080
And there aren't as many tools out there,

27:20.080 --> 27:22.560
for instance, for doing time series and signals.

27:22.560 --> 27:25.480
Like a lot of it is coming from like the audio processing

27:25.480 --> 27:28.600
community and some things that you, you know,

27:28.600 --> 27:30.280
use for other kinds of sequential data,

27:30.280 --> 27:32.520
like text you could apply to this, you know,

27:32.520 --> 27:33.360
these kinds of data.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.440
But maybe it's not it's natural to do it.

27:36.440 --> 27:39.080
And so you can think about, you know, you could,

27:39.080 --> 27:41.560
there is a need, you know, for just general tools

27:41.560 --> 27:45.160
for signals and time series, more work in that area.

27:45.160 --> 27:47.640
But then, you know, so that's kind of a more general area

27:47.640 --> 27:49.520
that people could contribute in.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.440
But at the same time, then it's not specific

27:51.440 --> 27:55.200
to these kinds of specific, like, you know, earthquakes

27:55.200 --> 27:58.480
and the seismic networks and all that.

27:58.480 --> 28:00.960
So there is, I guess there's kind of a trade off that,

28:00.960 --> 28:03.560
you can risk getting too far in either direction, I guess,

28:03.560 --> 28:05.960
making something too general.

28:05.960 --> 28:07.840
But I'm hoping to kind of be in that space of thinking,

28:07.840 --> 28:08.960
like when I'm thinking about stuff,

28:08.960 --> 28:10.600
even if I'm applying it to seismic data,

28:10.600 --> 28:12.880
I try to think, like, could this be applied more generally

28:12.880 --> 28:15.400
to other kinds of signals or time series?

28:15.400 --> 28:18.280
And that's often when I read papers, I think, like, you know,

28:18.280 --> 28:21.520
is this a method, like, could we adapt this to work for,

28:21.520 --> 28:22.920
you know, if it's designed for images

28:22.920 --> 28:24.560
or for other kinds of sequential data?

28:24.560 --> 28:26.240
Like, would this work for signal processing?

28:26.240 --> 28:28.680
What it worked for time series analysis?

28:28.680 --> 28:31.040
Because those are kinds of data you see a lot,

28:31.040 --> 28:33.360
or sensor networks of other sorts, right?

28:33.360 --> 28:34.960
There's a lot of different time series

28:34.960 --> 28:37.720
where you have multiple sort of sources

28:37.720 --> 28:40.560
where you're recording them, multiple sensor locations.

28:40.560 --> 28:43.680
And so, you know, a lot of times the relationship,

28:43.680 --> 28:44.960
this sort of spatial relationship

28:44.960 --> 28:47.720
between those may be different in different applications.

28:47.720 --> 28:49.800
But I think there's still, you know,

28:49.800 --> 28:52.720
there's still potentially insight

28:52.720 --> 28:54.440
from one problem that could be applied to the other.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.600
So, I don't really have a good answer to that problem.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.640
Like, it is, is a spectrum, it just depends,

28:59.640 --> 29:01.240
like, you could get really specific

29:01.240 --> 29:03.440
to a particular problem or to general

29:03.440 --> 29:05.880
so that you're not solving anyone's problem.

29:05.880 --> 29:10.880
As a new faculty, you know, with a new lab,

29:10.880 --> 29:15.880
you know, charting a direction through questions like that,

29:15.880 --> 29:20.400
how do you approach them, where do you start?

29:20.400 --> 29:22.280
So, I've been trying to, I have some sort of areas

29:22.280 --> 29:24.320
that I'm interested in where I think they're, you know,

29:24.320 --> 29:29.320
are contributions that we could make for kind of,

29:29.320 --> 29:30.320
I try to think like could this,

29:30.320 --> 29:31.720
is this seem like something that could help

29:31.720 --> 29:34.800
or scientists in general, but not always for a specific task?

29:34.800 --> 29:36.600
Although I often apply it to seismic data

29:36.600 --> 29:39.800
and then kind of show it to my seismology colleagues

29:39.800 --> 29:44.000
because it's a fun to talk to them about these things.

29:44.000 --> 29:46.120
But for instance, like right now,

29:46.120 --> 29:48.640
there's some of the areas that I think are really useful

29:48.640 --> 29:49.480
for scientists.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.440
One is like just getting back to this problem of like,

29:51.440 --> 29:52.480
well, how do you do learning

29:52.480 --> 29:55.800
when you don't have very many labeled examples?

29:55.800 --> 29:58.480
And for the method I developed as a PhD student,

29:58.480 --> 30:00.320
we sort of assumed you had no knowledge

30:01.280 --> 30:03.680
and you are no examples.

30:03.680 --> 30:05.440
And then you had to sort of bake some domain knowledge

30:05.440 --> 30:07.760
into your solution, but there's also, you know,

30:07.760 --> 30:09.680
you could also do like semi-supervised techniques.

30:09.680 --> 30:13.320
There's a lot of techniques using, you know, some labels

30:13.320 --> 30:15.000
and also using domain knowledge.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.080
So I think there's a lot of opportunities there

30:17.080 --> 30:19.640
in different scientific areas.

30:19.640 --> 30:23.040
I'm also interested in one area that I'm interested in,

30:23.040 --> 30:26.000
recently is looking at sort of interpretability

30:26.000 --> 30:27.760
and kind of explainable AI methods

30:27.760 --> 30:30.600
because I think now that a lot of geoscientists

30:30.600 --> 30:33.840
are throwing deep learning models at their solutions,

30:33.840 --> 30:34.920
you hear a lot of people talking about like,

30:34.920 --> 30:36.760
well, how do we, this is a black box.

30:36.760 --> 30:39.160
They don't like that it's a black box.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.800
Because scientists, they don't like black boxes.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.440
And the goal, if your goal is ultimately

30:42.440 --> 30:44.960
to discover something new, then just having

30:44.960 --> 30:46.920
some kind of a black box solution

30:46.920 --> 30:48.400
where you, you know, feed in an input

30:48.400 --> 30:51.360
and output something isn't very satisfying to scientists.

30:51.360 --> 30:56.120
So having tools that they can use to better interpret

30:56.120 --> 30:58.080
the models, one, to just, you know,

30:58.080 --> 31:00.360
one case maybe to understand the representations,

31:00.360 --> 31:02.480
the model is learning, because that itself may be the thing

31:02.480 --> 31:03.320
that we don't know.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.840
Like, we don't know how to model something.

31:04.840 --> 31:06.640
We can train a neural network to model it.

31:06.640 --> 31:07.720
And now we want to understand like,

31:07.720 --> 31:09.360
what did it actually learn?

31:09.360 --> 31:10.840
And the other case, and this is more

31:10.840 --> 31:13.680
for the kind of routine seismic processing example

31:13.680 --> 31:16.800
is you may want to be able to, you know, interpret the model

31:16.800 --> 31:19.680
to make sure that it's doing something that makes sense, right?

31:19.680 --> 31:21.560
You want to be able to trust that your model

31:21.560 --> 31:27.000
is making predictions that you're willing to trust

31:27.000 --> 31:29.560
and that you think are correct, especially when you start

31:29.560 --> 31:32.800
some of these seismic applications, you know,

31:32.800 --> 31:34.160
earthquakes are natural hazards.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.680
And so there's a lot of ways in which, you know,

31:37.680 --> 31:39.880
these, the decisions that your machine learning algorithm

31:39.880 --> 31:44.000
is making starts to get close to kind of making decisions

31:44.000 --> 31:46.080
that relate to, you know, public messaging

31:46.080 --> 31:49.400
or putting out warnings about things to the public.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.040
And so then you really want to have confidence

31:51.040 --> 31:53.440
in what your solutions are doing.

31:53.440 --> 31:57.160
And also for those applications, you do have a lot of,

31:57.160 --> 31:59.000
you do have some cases in which analysts

31:59.000 --> 32:01.480
are looking at the data and actually reviewing

32:01.480 --> 32:04.800
all of the earthquakes and events that are coming in.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.920
And so you also want tools that are going to help them

32:06.920 --> 32:08.600
understand what's going on, you know,

32:08.600 --> 32:11.080
where they should focus their attention.

32:12.280 --> 32:13.960
So that they're, you know, when they have to like review

32:13.960 --> 32:17.000
all of this, it's a lot of data to manually process.

32:17.000 --> 32:18.240
We have tools to automate it,

32:18.240 --> 32:19.800
but then you need something kind of bridge that

32:19.800 --> 32:23.360
and help point them to like, what are the strange cases?

32:23.360 --> 32:25.680
What are the cases where the model isn't really sure

32:25.680 --> 32:28.960
or, you know, how can we sort of combine

32:28.960 --> 32:31.560
both the analysts, expertise and the modeling?

32:31.560 --> 32:32.960
So there's a lot of different places

32:32.960 --> 32:37.200
where I think there's work to be done for this particular problem,

32:37.200 --> 32:39.280
but also just as kind of a general set of tools

32:39.280 --> 32:41.440
being able to interpret machine learning models

32:41.440 --> 32:44.000
is going to be useful for scientists.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.680
That's an area I'm kind of been focusing on recently

32:46.680 --> 32:48.240
and excited about.

32:48.240 --> 32:49.640
Awesome, awesome.

32:49.640 --> 32:52.320
When you're out talking to scientists

32:52.320 --> 32:57.320
that are, you know, familiar with machine learning

32:57.320 --> 32:59.320
in the sense that they know it's something

32:59.320 --> 33:00.640
that could potentially help them,

33:00.640 --> 33:04.440
but not, you know, necessarily trained in machine learning.

33:04.440 --> 33:07.760
What are the questions that you get most frequently?

33:07.760 --> 33:12.160
Yeah, so I think there's, I think scientists,

33:12.160 --> 33:15.000
I think it's different like five years ago than it is now.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.240
I think now a lot more scientists are generally familiar

33:18.240 --> 33:20.400
with machine learning, whereas when I first started working

33:20.400 --> 33:22.560
on this stuff, or even I would say as recently

33:22.560 --> 33:23.680
as like four or five years ago,

33:23.680 --> 33:24.760
there were a lot of people who are just like,

33:24.760 --> 33:25.760
what is machine learning?

33:25.760 --> 33:28.880
I don't quite know what it even is.

33:28.880 --> 33:31.240
I think now the questions actually get the most

33:31.240 --> 33:33.680
when I talk to people, I mean, sometimes they're like,

33:33.680 --> 33:36.080
you know, does this make sense for my data set

33:36.080 --> 33:37.840
and they kind of, you know, tell you about their problem?

33:37.840 --> 33:39.920
And usually they don't have enough labeled examples.

33:39.920 --> 33:43.720
They're like, is 20 enough in those kind of things?

33:43.720 --> 33:46.200
But the other thing, the big question is often,

33:46.200 --> 33:48.080
how do we teach this to our students?

33:48.080 --> 33:50.320
Like what skills do our students need?

33:51.280 --> 33:53.920
You know, what should, what classes should we be requiring?

33:53.920 --> 33:56.280
What statistical skills or computing skills

33:56.280 --> 33:59.320
should we be teaching them so that they can like learn

33:59.320 --> 34:02.080
to do this, or even, you know,

34:02.080 --> 34:04.240
if they decide to leave academia

34:04.240 --> 34:06.280
and go into a job and industry,

34:06.280 --> 34:08.960
like how do we train them so that they learn

34:08.960 --> 34:11.240
the data science skills because it's not something

34:11.240 --> 34:13.760
that's incorporated into sort of,

34:13.760 --> 34:15.280
at least at the undergraduate level

34:15.280 --> 34:18.360
in most universities into like a geology major

34:18.360 --> 34:20.400
or like environmental science type major,

34:20.400 --> 34:21.880
these kinds of programs,

34:21.880 --> 34:23.800
the students aren't necessarily learning these skills,

34:23.800 --> 34:25.240
but I think there's growing recognition

34:25.240 --> 34:28.520
that it's, you know, computing and data science

34:28.520 --> 34:29.760
are important in these fields

34:29.760 --> 34:31.160
and that students need to be learning it.

34:31.160 --> 34:33.120
So that's actually, I think the most common question

34:33.120 --> 34:35.160
recently that I got is just, you know,

34:35.160 --> 34:36.800
what should we be teaching our students?

34:36.800 --> 34:39.160
How do we train them to do this?

34:39.160 --> 34:40.600
How do you tend to answer that?

34:40.600 --> 34:44.600
Is it just yes, you train them in the stuff or?

34:44.600 --> 34:46.600
Well, I tend to, well, I mean, I tend to say, you know,

34:46.600 --> 34:48.640
I think students should, you know,

34:48.640 --> 34:51.000
I think we should, you know, all undergraduate,

34:51.000 --> 34:52.120
my opinion of a verb to me,

34:52.120 --> 34:54.040
I would have all undergraduates take a statistics class

34:54.040 --> 34:55.200
in a linear algebra course

34:55.200 --> 34:57.200
and then learn like Python or something.

34:58.480 --> 35:00.360
But I think it's still something

35:00.360 --> 35:03.560
where for a lot of science majors, it, you know,

35:03.560 --> 35:06.680
those kinds of courses, like they still have to take calculus

35:06.680 --> 35:08.560
and maybe there's a statistics requirement

35:08.560 --> 35:10.560
but they often don't have to take any computing

35:10.560 --> 35:13.560
necessarily a lot of the students are learning these skills

35:13.560 --> 35:14.920
but they're learning them informally,

35:14.920 --> 35:17.080
like they'll do a research project with a faculty

35:17.080 --> 35:20.320
and they'll kind of pick up how to do some like MAT lab coding

35:20.320 --> 35:23.440
or are whatever language is being used in the lab.

35:23.440 --> 35:26.000
But they're not, they're kind of picking it up as they go

35:26.000 --> 35:28.760
and I think some of the students are missing this

35:28.760 --> 35:31.040
and especially also the formal math training,

35:31.040 --> 35:33.160
like they see it in their physics courses,

35:33.160 --> 35:34.720
they'll see a little bit of linear algebra

35:34.720 --> 35:36.160
and they'll see a little bit of statistics

35:36.160 --> 35:38.520
that come up in their other science courses

35:38.520 --> 35:40.520
but they're not getting the sort of level of training

35:40.520 --> 35:42.640
that I think they need to really dig

35:42.640 --> 35:44.520
into some of these machine learning techniques,

35:44.520 --> 35:47.240
like they're learning how to enough to, you know,

35:47.240 --> 35:49.360
be able to, they can probably run, you know,

35:49.360 --> 35:51.280
a package like Scikit learn on their data

35:51.280 --> 35:53.640
and I teach the students in my class how to use it

35:53.640 --> 35:55.680
but if they really want to start then, you know,

35:55.680 --> 35:57.720
developing new tools that are, you know,

35:57.720 --> 36:00.120
tailored to their specific application

36:00.120 --> 36:02.440
that are incorporating domain knowledge into it

36:02.440 --> 36:05.240
a little bit more rather than using a tool out of the box,

36:05.240 --> 36:07.520
then they really need that mathematical background

36:07.520 --> 36:10.920
and that's something that I think some of the students

36:10.920 --> 36:12.520
who are sort of keen on that are getting,

36:12.520 --> 36:13.640
like they're learning it on their own,

36:13.640 --> 36:14.960
they're signing up for those courses

36:14.960 --> 36:18.880
but it's not, it's not something that's kind of standard

36:18.880 --> 36:20.640
in these fields yet.

36:20.640 --> 36:24.200
Well, Karen, thank you so much for joining us

36:24.200 --> 36:27.880
to share a little bit about what you're working on,

36:27.880 --> 36:29.680
best of luck with your new lab

36:29.680 --> 36:34.160
and looking forward to seeing lots of great stuff

36:34.160 --> 36:36.360
come from your and your team.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.680
All right, yeah, thank you so much.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.680
It was nice to have you.

36:39.680 --> 36:43.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
