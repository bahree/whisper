00:00.000 --> 00:16.080
All right, everyone. I am here with Jack Berkowitz. Jack is the chief data officer with ADP. Jack,

00:16.080 --> 00:21.840
welcome to the Twimal AI podcast. Thanks. Thanks for having me. I'm looking forward to digging into

00:21.840 --> 00:27.680
our conversation. We'll be talking about some of the ways that ADP is using machine learning,

00:27.680 --> 00:33.680
but to get us started, I'd love to have you share a little bit about your background and a little

00:33.680 --> 00:39.440
bit about your career. Sure. I've got a long career been at this for 30, 31 years now.

00:40.400 --> 00:47.120
Kind of three phases. First phase was largely doing work with DARPA. So early 90s, mid 90s,

00:47.120 --> 00:52.880
doing a lot of work and at that time it was cutting edge, things like ontologies,

00:52.880 --> 01:00.160
distributed reasoning technology. All sorts of stuff that people at DARPA would normally

01:00.800 --> 01:06.480
equate. Then I spent about 12 years doing various startups, some in the semantic web, some in search,

01:06.480 --> 01:14.080
some in analytics. And then for the past 10 years, split between Oracle and now ADP, really running

01:14.080 --> 01:19.360
large scale enterprise level analytics products. And so we build products for other people.

01:19.360 --> 01:25.920
And then my job at ADP is a combination of building products for clients. And then also doing

01:25.920 --> 01:33.120
some things internally that ADP uses. Awesome. Awesome. And when you started at ADP, you started out

01:33.120 --> 01:40.960
in a product-centric role and transitioned over to CDO. I'd love to have you share a little bit

01:40.960 --> 01:48.160
about that transition, how it came about, and how you, it sounds like you still retain some

01:48.160 --> 01:53.280
product ownership there. Yeah, sure do. So the CDO role really has two faces to it.

01:54.560 --> 01:59.680
On the one hand, we build product for clients. We have tens of thousands of clients that use

01:59.680 --> 02:07.920
our analytics for HR, people analytics, compensation analytics, recruiting, things like that.

02:07.920 --> 02:12.800
And then we also have a defensive nature to the CDO organization. So besides having all the data

02:12.800 --> 02:18.800
advantage, what do we do to protect the information? And one of the big messages that I spend a lot

02:18.800 --> 02:24.880
of time on is talking about data governance. So it's pretty funny because as product development,

02:24.880 --> 02:28.800
people as machine learning people, we hear the word data governance and we immediately think,

02:28.800 --> 02:34.480
okay, people are trying to get in our way. We're trying to hold us back. And actually what it means to

02:34.480 --> 02:40.880
us is it enables us to get the data into a nice, clean way so that we can share. And so that,

02:40.880 --> 02:44.880
you know, somebody builds a NML algorithm to do something. I don't know what, you know, but

02:46.400 --> 02:52.560
for job matching, the entire community of developers can then use that algorithm for job matching,

02:52.560 --> 02:57.200
right? So that's all part of that governance that we're putting in place today.

02:57.200 --> 03:03.440
So I'd love to come back to that data governance topic. Before we do, I've jumped right in and

03:03.440 --> 03:10.960
maybe taking it for granted that folks know who ADP is. And it may be the case that most do, but

03:10.960 --> 03:17.920
why don't you give us a quick summary of ADP and the company's focus? Yeah. So ADP is the world's

03:17.920 --> 03:26.240
largest provider of HR payroll benefit solutions. So we have over 920,000 clients in 140 countries.

03:26.240 --> 03:34.160
And, you know, most people know ADP because their W2 or their paycheck has been issued by ADP.

03:34.160 --> 03:39.200
Maybe not today, but maybe at some point in their career. And if it hasn't, it will be, right?

03:39.680 --> 03:44.160
One of the things that we talk a lot about ADP is it's not your grandfather's ADP, but it's

03:44.160 --> 03:50.000
actually my grandfather's ADP. So they've been around for about 70 years. He had a small gas station.

03:50.000 --> 03:56.560
The update is employees and the family through ADP. But, you know, a series of firsts of the

03:56.560 --> 04:01.600
company, really the first companies ever use computers for payroll. First company to build a,

04:02.400 --> 04:07.440
what we now call self-doors of service used to be called something else in the late 90s for doing

04:07.440 --> 04:16.880
HR. First company to do mobile apps for the employees of companies. And so every day, you know,

04:16.880 --> 04:23.120
every week you can check your payroll, you can clock in and out, you can, you know, check your 401K

04:23.120 --> 04:30.160
balance through the through your mobile app. So lots of people, about 58,000 people today,

04:32.800 --> 04:38.000
building products, and then providing great expertise. Because the one thing about HR is that

04:38.000 --> 04:43.360
it's not just about the software. You know, there's, you know, regulations that have to be maintained,

04:43.360 --> 04:48.560
there's problems for, for employees or clients that need to be solved, you know, what if I'm

04:48.560 --> 04:54.560
adopting cross-order? What's the impact on my pay or, or any sort of things like that? And so,

04:54.560 --> 04:59.040
you know, our CEO likes to say, hey, it's about building great products with great expertise.

04:59.040 --> 05:05.920
And that's really what we try to bring to bear. I think one of the consequences of that long history

05:05.920 --> 05:13.040
is, you know, the companies associated with some of those early technologies that maybe weren't

05:13.040 --> 05:19.280
so early when it first got started, you know, to be very clear when I think of kind of poster

05:19.280 --> 05:24.560
trials for the mainframe. ADP is one of those companies who comes to mind and yet we're connected

05:24.560 --> 05:30.320
because you were delivering a keynote at AWS re-invent, talking about some of the things the

05:30.320 --> 05:36.320
companies doing with machine learning as part of the data cloud product. Talk a little bit about

05:36.320 --> 05:42.800
what it means to be building cutting edge data-centric product in a company with that kind of history

05:42.800 --> 05:49.680
and legacy. Yeah, so we still have a little bit of those mainframes running around. And guess what?

05:49.680 --> 05:58.640
So does every bank and every, you know, DMV and everything else. And it's funny, right? As somebody

05:58.640 --> 06:04.320
who's always on the cutting edge, you heard like DARPA and cloud and everything, you know, what do

06:04.320 --> 06:08.880
you mean? Well, the data's got to come from somewhere, right? And if you want reliability,

06:08.880 --> 06:14.480
tell us, it doesn't actually matter where the data comes from. What we're able to do is harness

06:14.480 --> 06:19.840
the semantics of it, the meanings of it, bring it together and make it available in a platform

06:20.880 --> 06:27.200
in something that other people can use, blows and our own teams can use. And that's the essential part

06:27.200 --> 06:32.080
of it. And so, you know, when we were looking, how do we do that in a modern way and how do we

06:32.080 --> 06:37.040
keep up with the pace of business? And, you know, the pace of business is just unbelievable,

06:37.040 --> 06:44.000
particularly now since COVID hit, you know, for us moving it into the cloud made total sense,

06:44.000 --> 06:50.880
right? And so we're sinking information every single minute back and forth between, you know,

06:50.880 --> 06:55.840
those classic on-prem data centers, but their data centers, just the same way as any other data

06:55.840 --> 07:02.880
center. It's not like it's running under my desk or something. And we're sinking information,

07:02.880 --> 07:07.760
and we're extracting value out of it by taking advantage of all the services that we can get

07:07.760 --> 07:14.880
in the AWS cloud. You're coming about platforms, ties back to the the common and about governance,

07:14.880 --> 07:21.280
and what brings them together is this idea of making it easier for your teams to be productive

07:21.280 --> 07:26.800
with that data, to pull meaning out of it, make predictions with that kind of thing. Can you

07:26.800 --> 07:35.280
talk a little bit about the challenges with harnessing the data that the organization has at its

07:35.280 --> 07:40.160
scale? Yeah, let me give you a great example. I'll give you two different examples. Let me start

07:40.160 --> 07:45.120
with one though that it really summarizes not just harnessing the meaning, but also, you know,

07:45.760 --> 07:51.520
the amount of machine learning we're building, right? So in any given month, we pay about 30 million

07:51.520 --> 07:59.600
people in the US. And for those 31 million, 30 million people, we've got about 21 million job

07:59.600 --> 08:05.440
titles. Okay? So, yeah, for about eight or, you know, for about nine million, we don't know what they

08:05.440 --> 08:11.360
do for a living, but for 21 million, we do. We need to crunch that data down into some common

08:11.360 --> 08:19.120
job titles. In fact, we crunch it down to about 9,000 job titles. Now, we don't do that manually.

08:19.120 --> 08:26.400
We don't do that with rules, right? And so we run all that in a data driven machine learning pipeline

08:26.400 --> 08:31.520
using some pretty advanced technology to get that done. All the latest buzzwords you can imagine

08:31.520 --> 08:38.560
plus a few are involved in that pipeline. And you say, well, why do that? Well, if I want to know

08:38.560 --> 08:44.640
what a software engineer makes, you would think that would be easy, but company A calls it software

08:44.640 --> 08:52.960
engineer three company B calls it, I don't know, development specialist company C calls it, you know,

08:52.960 --> 08:59.920
creative machine learning guru juggler, right? And we've got to have a way to bring all that in from

08:59.920 --> 09:04.640
art. Yeah, you can only imagine everybody gets to invent their own title, right? And we've got to

09:04.640 --> 09:09.200
have a way to bring that together. And we do that for our compensation benchmarks. We do that and we

09:09.200 --> 09:15.200
use that same exact thing in sort of our recruiting and sourcing systems. We do the same thing in our

09:15.200 --> 09:21.360
performance review systems. And that's a great example of the challenge. And then we have the same

09:21.360 --> 09:27.040
exact challenge when we try to provide the capabilities for companies to operate in multiple countries.

09:27.680 --> 09:34.160
So things that may be obvious in the US like holiday or vacation are called different things in

09:34.160 --> 09:40.320
different countries. And in fact, the math and the calculation law was different depending on

09:40.320 --> 09:45.920
the country you're in. And so we have the ability by bringing all that information together, having

09:45.920 --> 09:52.480
you know, models on top to combine that information so that our clients benefit through all this

09:52.480 --> 09:59.440
processing. And so when you talk about data governance, are you thinking about it akin to kind

09:59.440 --> 10:04.720
of a traditional enterprise architecture, big committees deciding who can do what and where

10:04.720 --> 10:09.440
data sits and that kind of thing? You know, I'd like to say that there are no committees and we're

10:09.440 --> 10:19.280
we're a reflection of the distributed internet. It's not quite there. But so we do have a central

10:19.280 --> 10:24.960
group, but we really try to operate in more of a hub and spoke or a federated way. And in in

10:24.960 --> 10:30.160
that sense, you know, a lot of people are talking about data mesh these days. We think about

10:30.160 --> 10:38.320
as a semantic mesh or a metrics mesh. So we want the teams that are responsible to operate on and

10:38.320 --> 10:43.680
have the domain knowledge. There's a central group, right, that makes sure that things can attach

10:43.680 --> 10:50.400
because otherwise it's just pandemonium, right? So there's a central group that ensures that either

10:50.400 --> 10:56.720
it's a concept, right, a domain object or a or a new metric that it can attach to some parent

10:56.720 --> 11:01.600
object. But in that case, you know, the central team's very thin and the amount of work they do

11:01.600 --> 11:07.520
is very thin. It's really distributed. We have, you know, tens of not tens, but hundreds and hundreds

11:07.520 --> 11:16.800
of people in development. And we want them to have the independence to be able to create in a way

11:16.800 --> 11:25.760
that they can do best. Now related to that is also then the data lineage. So it doesn't

11:25.760 --> 11:31.600
know good for somebody say, Hey, I've got the data source of data sources for, you know, some problem

11:32.320 --> 11:38.560
benefits. If they don't provide how that data has been brought together and then managed and

11:38.560 --> 11:43.760
then brought up. So we also have artifacts that, you know, if you're going to participate in that

11:43.760 --> 11:50.480
in that world of this federation or this, this combination of information, well, then you also

11:50.480 --> 11:56.240
have the responsibility to say, Hey, this is where my data came from. I'm going to take care of

11:56.240 --> 12:01.680
the data quality of it. And I'm going to advertise to all my other people that collaborate in that

12:01.680 --> 12:07.600
sense. So, you know, I said, Hey, when you were asking me about my career, I started and I did a

12:07.600 --> 12:11.840
lot of work in the semantic web. We actually bring a lot of those concepts to bear. Now whether or

12:11.840 --> 12:17.040
not it's the formal semantics and the language, I don't know, but that idea of distributed data,

12:17.600 --> 12:23.120
self-describing data and then attachment of data is something that we try to bring to bear across

12:23.120 --> 12:34.720
our company. And the ultimate objective is to allow teams to move more quickly. Yeah, I mean,

12:34.720 --> 12:39.680
I think, I think it's three, three key things to us. The first one is about pace, right?

12:39.680 --> 12:45.760
Or client, the world's busy. Clients are demanding and the world's situations are changing all the

12:45.760 --> 12:52.560
time, right? Second thing is, is, is, is about reliability. Because we're messing with people's

12:52.560 --> 12:58.560
paychecks. At the end of the day, that's what we do. And, and, you know, that's the most personal

12:58.560 --> 13:03.440
data there is other than maybe healthcare data, right? If you want to, if you want to see

13:03.440 --> 13:09.840
somebody get excited, make a mistake on their paycheck, right? And so we, we have to have a little

13:09.840 --> 13:14.160
bit of reliability in terms of what we're doing. So the first thing's about pace, second thing's

13:14.160 --> 13:19.520
about reliability. And the third thing is really about clarity and explainability, whether it's

13:19.520 --> 13:25.360
to each other inside the development teams or whether it's to our, and clients, right? This is why,

13:26.000 --> 13:31.600
you know, so there's like an explainability and ethics overlay to all of this as to why we're

13:31.600 --> 13:37.760
so into this, the data governance approach. You gave us a couple of specific examples of

13:37.760 --> 13:44.160
machine learning use cases there. Be curious, have you talked broadly about the various ways

13:44.160 --> 13:52.800
that ML has used? And my guess is that it's used primarily in kind of new products that are built

13:52.800 --> 13:59.120
on top of the data assets that the company has, as opposed to kind of that core payroll processing

13:59.120 --> 14:06.400
or other use cases there as well. You'd be surprised. Yeah, no, you'd be surprised. And so we have

14:06.400 --> 14:12.080
machine learning throughout the entire corporation at this point. And it's come on really fast.

14:12.080 --> 14:16.800
It's come on fast because we've separated the data, but we've also exposed all the machine learning

14:16.800 --> 14:24.560
processes through microservices or through APIs. And then that allows, yes, totally, brand new products,

14:24.560 --> 14:28.400
they're intelligent from the ground up, they're everything everybody could imagine. You know,

14:28.400 --> 14:36.720
there's a chatbot for the screen changes. But we also use it to do things on the older products

14:36.720 --> 14:44.960
as almost overlays into them, right? So the ability to check a payroll before it's submitted and

14:44.960 --> 14:51.440
all the money goes, the ability to check for anomalies, that's all based on new machine learning

14:51.440 --> 14:56.640
capabilities because now we have the data in one place. We can do that and we can provide new

14:56.640 --> 15:01.680
capabilities to existing what we're thought of as legacy applications. And so you can make

15:01.680 --> 15:08.400
something fresh for our clients at the same time as building net new products all at the same time.

15:08.400 --> 15:16.880
And so we're getting great reception on sort of that innovation aspect with our clients because

15:16.880 --> 15:21.600
we've taken some pretty hard steps in terms of building a data platform and building up machine

15:21.600 --> 15:27.600
learning. But it really is to have benefit to them. Let's dig into that platform that you've

15:27.600 --> 15:31.840
built a little bit. Is that the data cloud? Yeah, so the data cloud is really this collection of

15:31.840 --> 15:37.360
capabilities, right? Some people identify as the products we build and some identify as this

15:37.360 --> 15:45.440
platform of data. It's built on top of a set of those capabilities, whether it's Amazon EMR

15:45.440 --> 15:56.000
or Amazon SageMaker and S3s at the bottom of it. We have some partners in as well, some of the

15:56.000 --> 16:02.400
key partners in in the data space because there's certain things dealing with, for example, data

16:02.400 --> 16:08.320
security that still is an emerging area of technology. And so we'll bring in partners as need be.

16:08.320 --> 16:13.120
We don't want to constrain people as well. So if they've built models using, for example,

16:13.120 --> 16:22.000
libraries like BERT or GPT-3, they have access to be able to do and use those models as well.

16:23.200 --> 16:30.400
We want to govern those use of third-party systems because we don't want any hacker to infiltrate

16:30.400 --> 16:35.760
our supply chain of ML, if you will. But all of it's there and all of it's available.

16:35.760 --> 16:44.800
We have a sort of a standard way. Either data scientists or data engineers can enter and interact

16:44.800 --> 16:51.040
with the platform. Security is all managed and so they have access to certain data assets. There

16:51.040 --> 16:57.600
may be other data assets that they need to request and get permission to use. Things that get very

16:57.600 --> 17:04.960
personal about people, for example. And then everything included in there is everything's obfuscated

17:04.960 --> 17:11.280
and encrypted. And so if there are data elements that you don't have a need to know, as a

17:11.280 --> 17:17.920
data scientist, you don't need to know. But we'll obfuscate it, but the engine can still perform

17:17.920 --> 17:23.200
actions against it. And so that's a big aspect of the platform is to make sure that

17:24.880 --> 17:30.800
to reduce the amount of data duplication, but also maintain control of some very personal data

17:30.800 --> 17:39.520
that people have. Did the platform start out as kind of abstracting things that you built for

17:39.520 --> 17:45.840
a specific product into a generalized capability or did it start as a larger effort that pulled in

17:46.480 --> 17:51.920
various internal and external things? What's the history? Yeah, now in my experience boiling the

17:51.920 --> 17:57.040
ocean up front to build a platform just leaves you with a bunch of steam and some salt in the

17:57.040 --> 18:02.800
bottom of a container. And then you're just like, well, where did it go? It's like you got this,

18:02.800 --> 18:10.000
well, you got to, you don't have any wrinkles in your shirt, right? And so we build very specific

18:10.000 --> 18:17.840
application elements and we really, really focus on those. And then as if you got two, three,

18:17.840 --> 18:21.840
four of those together, then you can start to line up the commonalities and then you can drop

18:21.840 --> 18:26.880
things out. So, you know, I like to say, well, we moved to the cloud in 2019, but we actually started

18:26.880 --> 18:31.280
a few years earlier on building machine learning. And that actually taught us enough to be able to

18:31.280 --> 18:36.560
know, hey, we need it to move this to the cloud. And what did we need to do to move to the cloud?

18:36.560 --> 18:42.880
Right? And so we build and we continue to do that, you know, build an application for employment

18:42.880 --> 18:47.200
verification, right? So if people are getting mortgages, they need to make sure their employment is

18:47.200 --> 18:52.960
verified and that their income is verified by the mortgage companies. Once you build that,

18:52.960 --> 18:58.320
hey, wow, you know, there's a new type of machine learning we can do to take care of, you know,

18:58.320 --> 19:03.440
name disambiguation across multiple people named Jack Berkowitz. I have the strangest name in the

19:03.440 --> 19:08.480
world and it turns out there's like six of us on LinkedIn right now. So, you know, that way you

19:08.480 --> 19:15.040
can, you can deal with these types of things. So when you say application elements in the context of

19:15.040 --> 19:19.760
the platform, are those applications or are they kind of platform capabilities?

19:20.320 --> 19:26.880
Um, they're kind of both, kind of both, right? So, so a reasoner is a reason, you know,

19:26.880 --> 19:36.160
a reasoner that decides about, um, uh, matching of a candidate to a job or a job to a candidate.

19:36.160 --> 19:40.720
So you tell me your skills and I'll tell you the jobs that are available. Is that an application

19:40.720 --> 19:46.640
or is that an ML component? It's kind of both, right? It's, it's, it's, it's actually a number of

19:46.640 --> 19:53.760
ML components all put together. But then I can abstract it as a single API so that downstream

19:53.760 --> 20:00.000
applications like our recruiting application or our internal sourcing application can hit that API.

20:00.000 --> 20:06.240
So it's, it's at both levels. What are some of the other components like that?

20:06.240 --> 20:13.280
So, for example, we, we do an awful lot with, um, projections. So we have a lot of different

20:13.280 --> 20:19.680
recommenders and optimizers, right? That'll do, deal with recommendations. So we have a capability,

20:20.240 --> 20:27.600
um, for operational managers, non-HR people to get pushed to them insights about their,

20:27.600 --> 20:34.960
their, their team status, right? How many people are leaving? How many people, um, need raises?

20:34.960 --> 20:39.200
What's the birthday every, everybody? You know, I have a large team inside the company.

20:39.920 --> 20:44.000
You know, I'm an operational manager like anybody else, but I still need that HR data.

20:44.960 --> 20:50.800
Um, that comes to me actually on that mobile app where I can check my pay, my, my, my payroll,

20:50.800 --> 20:56.400
right? Or my 401k. On the same exact app, I get these HR insights, right? So this

20:56.400 --> 21:01.600
recommendations there. Other areas that we, we build machine learning for are, um,

21:01.600 --> 21:05.520
um, you know, again, not just for clients, but for the internal company.

21:05.520 --> 21:11.600
How can we, how can we, you know, answer clients concerns about a regulation in a much more

21:11.600 --> 21:16.800
efficient way? And then we can do that. Have that answer, put it out on a chatbot, put it in the,

21:16.800 --> 21:24.720
in front of our, um, our customer service representatives, um, all sorts of different ways.

21:24.720 --> 21:28.960
And so these are, these are, you know, some knowledge management, some recommendations,

21:28.960 --> 21:33.680
some projections, you know, about, are you ready for the shopping season? That's our,

21:33.680 --> 21:38.800
our favorite one for retailers. So we can actually look at, oh, what's the rate at which you're

21:38.800 --> 21:42.800
hiring people? What's the rate at which people are leaving? How many jobs do you have open?

21:42.800 --> 21:47.840
What's the demand? So we can build this small little workforce planning capability,

21:47.840 --> 21:53.120
quickly by assembling our existing components and then have an advantage, uh, for our clients that

21:53.120 --> 22:01.760
use us as a company that is, you know, fully invested in cloud using cloud services at all

22:01.760 --> 22:09.040
different levels, including the platform services like SageMaker. Um, you know, you mentioned,

22:11.360 --> 22:17.040
uh, kind of these higher level services. I'm curious, how do you think through

22:17.040 --> 22:25.440
uh, what level services to consume from your cloud partner and, or, or conversely, what level,

22:25.440 --> 22:30.880
you know, do you target to build that versus, uh, use external services?

22:30.880 --> 22:35.120
And so I wish I would say that, I wish I could say that there was just like some cookbook out

22:35.120 --> 22:40.400
there, but there's not, right? Um, you know, the best thing for us is that we're, we're

22:40.400 --> 22:47.360
closely closely closely integrated with AWS in terms of engineer to engineer. And so people

22:47.360 --> 22:52.240
like me get the heck out of the way and let the engineers talk, which is the best way to have a

22:52.240 --> 22:59.920
partnership with a, with a, with a, with a tech group. Um, and so we, we'll look at capabilities

22:59.920 --> 23:05.440
and we'll brainstorm them together. Um, and then we'll iterate. So sometimes we've built things

23:05.440 --> 23:12.880
that turns out that that, uh, AWS may have. Sometimes they'll say, hey, we're not building it.

23:12.880 --> 23:18.160
And then, or a third party may say, yeah, it doesn't exist. So we'll have to build. Um,

23:18.160 --> 23:24.080
sometimes we have unique capabilities that we need. Um, so, uh, I try not, we try to be more

23:24.080 --> 23:29.440
as a content team and an application team rather than a core technology developer, you know,

23:29.440 --> 23:35.280
like low level code. But just recently we've built some very low level code to build a reporting

23:35.280 --> 23:40.160
application because the constraints, no matter what databases are out there today,

23:40.160 --> 23:44.800
aren't quite what we need for our clients with, you know, the hundreds of thousands of clients

23:44.800 --> 23:49.200
we have in terms of cost. And so we had to get down and start to build something. Now,

23:50.000 --> 23:55.920
we, the first ones to say we should open source this or, or, yeah, exactly. So whether we open

23:55.920 --> 24:02.240
source it or we find something in the community, um, that can replace it. So, so part of that,

24:02.240 --> 24:08.160
it's a some engineering discipline about, um, making sure that you're, you're extracting your blocks

24:08.160 --> 24:12.880
properly so that you, so because the one thing you know about technology, somebody's going to come

24:12.880 --> 24:20.080
along with a better mouse trap. And so, you know, you need to be ready to re-architect and re-factor.

24:20.080 --> 24:25.920
And so we think about it architecturally. We budget time for that as we go as well. But it's,

24:25.920 --> 24:33.760
it's the reality of the cloud. Mm-hmm. You mentioned the, the, the kind of scope of your

24:33.760 --> 24:41.760
customers just now. You also mentioned some scale, uh, figures during your keynote in terms of

24:41.760 --> 24:45.600
the amount of data that you're dealing, the number of transactions. Talk a little bit about that

24:45.600 --> 24:52.000
and the, the broad impact of scale on the way you deal with data. So I mentioned, right, 920,000

24:52.000 --> 25:00.080
clients, 140 countries. Um, you know, we do like 50 million people apply to jobs by our clients

25:00.080 --> 25:07.520
every year. We do 38 million people in payroll every year. Um, we do 11 million 1099s, right?

25:07.520 --> 25:12.640
That's an incredible amount of people doing contracting, right? So all that information comes

25:12.640 --> 25:20.000
together, the number that I put up on stage and it was, it was kind of fun. Um, we move 2.3 trillion

25:20.000 --> 25:26.080
dollars a year. Um, and the number that, you know, it was hard for me. And, and so we did this kind

25:26.080 --> 25:31.840
of thing where we said, what does 2.3 trillion dollars means? And so if it was a GDP, it would be

25:31.840 --> 25:36.960
somewhere between France and Italy in terms of GDP. Now our payments are not GDP, but it still

25:36.960 --> 25:41.680
gives you a sense of the scale. Now, France and Italy have better food than maybe we do, but,

25:42.400 --> 25:47.920
you know, it gives you, it gives you an idea of the scale. And, and then, you know, the

25:47.920 --> 25:55.040
elasticity to process that becomes, you know, insane, right? Uh, I think we do something, I can't

25:55.040 --> 26:00.160
remember the number that we put on stage, but it's like 300 trillion decisions by our machine learning

26:00.160 --> 26:06.960
every month. You know, and so you've got, well, does that mean 312 trillion queries? No, but it,

26:06.960 --> 26:12.000
it means, you know, the individual decision processes that the algorithms are taking as a process.

26:12.000 --> 26:20.160
Um, you know, to somebody who's been around for a while in the business, that's just mind boggling.

26:20.160 --> 26:25.040
I remember when people were pointing the word petabyte, and now we toss around exabytes, and we,

26:25.040 --> 26:31.200
you know, zettabytes as if they're nothing, right? Um, I remember buying my first hard drive,

26:31.200 --> 26:36.800
and it had 10 megabytes of storage, and I remember a guy telling me, you'll never be able to fill that

26:36.800 --> 26:43.280
up. And we fill it up with single PowerPoint files today, right? So, um, so the scale is kind of

26:43.280 --> 26:52.400
amazing. Um, that $2.3 trillion, and everything that that that entails in terms of payments is,

26:52.400 --> 26:58.640
is the number that just sticks in our head every day. Are there specific ways that you have adapted

26:58.640 --> 27:05.760
the way that you operate or organize to kind of manage that scale? Well, I mean, I think I talked

27:05.760 --> 27:12.720
about a little bit. We, we have a, a real distribute in nature to the development teams. Um, and that's

27:12.720 --> 27:18.240
an important aspect to what we're doing. Um, the other thing is is, is, and I talked a little bit

27:18.240 --> 27:23.280
about this on stage, we really wanted to get to a data-centric culture. So rather than having pillars

27:23.280 --> 27:28.160
of, well, these are the data analysts, and these are the data scientists, and these are the domain

27:28.160 --> 27:33.760
experts, and these are, we got rid of all of that, right? We, you know, they're all together in one

27:33.760 --> 27:39.360
team. So a team, it's, it's modeled after this idea of a two pizza team, but we're not quite selling

27:39.360 --> 27:44.960
the products, right? Um, but it is this notion that we bring everybody together to go solve a specific

27:44.960 --> 27:49.840
problem. So, you know, because we have all these people inside of our company that know HR or

27:49.840 --> 27:54.960
no benefits or no payroll, we can bring people right into the development team to be part of the

27:54.960 --> 28:02.160
development team to go solve a problem. And so that's helped us, uh, create very very tight

28:02.160 --> 28:08.960
development circle, uh, timeframes, right? And then it's just iterating out of it. So those are our

28:08.960 --> 28:13.760
two keys. First of all, lots of federations, second of all, very small teams that are able to

28:13.760 --> 28:20.320
iterate on a very specific problem very quickly. Um, and, and those two, those teams are, are across

28:20.320 --> 28:27.760
domain, right? We, we literally, we want them virtually at least sitting alongside each other.

28:27.760 --> 28:32.640
Hey, what does this mean? Yeah, this does this, right? As opposed to going through, you know,

28:32.640 --> 28:35.680
paperwork exercises and presentations and stuff like that.

28:35.680 --> 28:41.920
The data focused folks on those teams, the data scientists, data engineers, they, are they all

28:41.920 --> 28:49.600
embedded within product organizations or do product folks kind of join, uh, into engineering

28:49.600 --> 28:56.480
efforts or yeah, that's a great question. So we look at it. So a lot of things in, in our company,

28:56.480 --> 29:01.760
uh, a lot of the teams will look at it as triad, engineering, product, and design. I actually

29:01.760 --> 29:09.440
look at it as quads, engineering, product, design, and data science, right? And each one of my teams

29:10.080 --> 29:16.160
has, has all four representatives. And then one point, there may not be a data science problem

29:16.160 --> 29:21.680
to be solved, right? But there's still somebody tracking that project from a data science perspective.

29:21.680 --> 29:27.440
Right? Just the same way as the UX on a certain project may just be the API, not, you know,

29:27.440 --> 29:33.920
not some elaborate UI, right? Uh, or maybe documentation could be the UX. So we have all four

29:33.920 --> 29:40.960
domains represented in this quad, fun idea. And the, how long has the company had data scientists?

29:41.600 --> 29:46.640
Probably since they started doing with it back in 1949, right? To be honest, right?

29:46.640 --> 29:51.920
It's a company of accountants, right? Uh, so it's fun, right? Oh, well, this data science using

29:51.920 --> 30:00.080
machine learning. Well, what's linear regression? Right? Uh, you know, it's fun. I, I interview,

30:00.080 --> 30:03.840
you know, people could just get out of school. Oh, I've been, I've learned this thing about linear

30:03.840 --> 30:10.400
regression. You know, it's been around for, since the 1800s, right? So, so I think it's a hard

30:10.400 --> 30:15.760
question to answer. I think if you want to look specifically at machine learning as a practice,

30:15.760 --> 30:20.400
you know, over the, you know, just like everybody else over the past, you know, six, eight,

30:20.400 --> 30:26.400
10 years has really been the ongoing of that. Um, you know, it's, it's, it's the end of 2021.

30:26.400 --> 30:30.000
Anybody who tells you they've got more than 10 years of machine learning experience,

30:30.000 --> 30:36.240
unless they were doing neural networks in the 90s is lying to you, right? Um, and so I think,

30:37.040 --> 30:42.240
I think, you know, in that, in that six, eight year time ranges, when we start to really add

30:42.240 --> 30:49.200
machine learning, and then by 2016, 2017, we had people really cranking on it. So the company was

30:49.200 --> 30:55.200
very, I think nimble into the new technology, more than I've seen on, uh, on other firms.

30:56.800 --> 31:00.720
And when you think about kind of this model that you have or you have the, the,

31:04.160 --> 31:08.240
the teams kind of embedded together for a lack of a better term, um,

31:08.240 --> 31:14.000
um, and as opposed to having a standalone data science organization or machine learning

31:14.000 --> 31:20.080
organization or something like that, how do you kind of take full advantage of the,

31:21.440 --> 31:27.760
so, so we, yeah, so we look at them as, we look at them as as sort of cohorts or, or however

31:27.760 --> 31:32.000
you want to call it grouping. So we have somebody in charge of data science for sure, right?

31:32.000 --> 31:36.480
But then people are matrixed out, just the same way as we have it with UX, the same way as,

31:36.480 --> 31:40.320
because they need career paths. I think that's the important thing people, right? And there's

31:40.320 --> 31:45.360
a value for them to get together and, and argue out different problems and everything. I try to

31:45.360 --> 31:49.440
visit with each team every week. It drives me nuts because, you know, they all want to meet

31:49.440 --> 31:57.040
exactly the same time. Um, so we, we create this community of practice. Um, so, and, and people

31:57.040 --> 32:01.040
often will say, well, it's a guild and I'm not sure it's a guild as much because there is an order

32:01.040 --> 32:06.880
of product managers. There's an Oregon data scientist, but the projects themselves that are being

32:06.880 --> 32:12.080
executed are executed in this, in this group. And then we have somebody leading that, and that

32:12.080 --> 32:17.120
person could be a data scientist, could be an engineering leader, could be a UX leader, or could be

32:17.120 --> 32:23.120
a product manager, leading that specific project. We just want to get the best person in charge

32:23.120 --> 32:28.240
to execute that, that, that project, if you will. We don't care where they come from.

32:28.240 --> 32:34.560
I was asking about that, but also, you know, where innovation comes from within the organization,

32:34.560 --> 32:42.400
do you, um, is it, you know, kind of tucked into long-standing product road maps, or how do you

32:43.200 --> 32:51.040
leverage opportunities that are created by ML and? Yeah, we, we, we kind of, I hate the top-down

32:51.040 --> 32:57.040
bottom-up thing, but that's in a way. It's happened. So, yeah, we definitely have where we want to be

32:57.040 --> 33:03.200
from a business perspective, but, but our, our job, particularly with senior managers,

33:03.200 --> 33:08.320
is just to give the where or the trajectory, let the engineers and the data scientists say,

33:08.320 --> 33:13.440
hey, I have a way to solve that problem. Maybe a way you hadn't thought about. And so,

33:14.080 --> 33:20.480
we do spend a lot of time on ideation during our development cycles. And we are also always open

33:21.280 --> 33:26.320
to rework as we need to. Now, you don't want to rework forever, but we always give the

33:26.320 --> 33:30.880
opportunity for people to do it. So, we're really, we're, we spend a lot of time talking

33:30.880 --> 33:35.760
why we want to build something. And what we want to build, we let those teams go and decide what

33:35.760 --> 33:41.040
and how they want to build it. Maybe to wrap us up, I'm curious, you're, you know, being in this

33:41.040 --> 33:47.600
being in an organization that's very much focused on kind of HR and talent. I'm most curious

33:47.600 --> 33:53.680
about how the company is dealing with, uh, getting the talent that it needs to innovate on the

33:53.680 --> 33:59.760
data side, very competitive marketplace, often kind of large legacy companies, quote-unquote,

33:59.760 --> 34:04.720
are considered to be less attractive places. Like, how do you deal with all that?

34:05.680 --> 34:10.800
So, the same fears that I think about every day, I wake up thinking about that, I go to sleep,

34:10.800 --> 34:15.920
thinking about that, I nightmare to thinking about that. But actually, I think we're really,

34:17.680 --> 34:22.000
we're really benefiting right now. And we're benefiting for two reasons. One, we took some

34:22.000 --> 34:28.000
steps to get to the cloud. And, you know, at least for what I do, for what you do, people

34:28.000 --> 34:33.360
are attracted to the data. They're attracted to the idea that they can actually work on something

34:33.360 --> 34:39.520
with meaningful data. And they're attracted to the culture around data to build these things,

34:39.520 --> 34:45.440
the quads and everything else. And I'm not saying that we don't have any problems getting talent.

34:45.440 --> 34:51.120
But what I would say is, is that we're really successful in being in great people to the company

34:51.120 --> 34:55.680
because once they get exposed to it, whether through the interview or, you know, through this type

34:55.680 --> 35:03.040
of, you know, discussion we're having now. And they dig into it, they get excited. And I think

35:03.040 --> 35:08.400
that's the best part is you see these sparkles even over, over all the, you know, zooming in

35:08.400 --> 35:13.040
everything else. See, sparkle in people's eyes when they discover something. And that's a spreading

35:13.040 --> 35:17.440
activation. And so, whether you're an older company like ours that's, you know, going through

35:17.440 --> 35:23.200
this transition or whether you're a startup, you know, I've worked at startups where there's

35:23.200 --> 35:29.680
not actually a lot exciting going on. Right? And so you really just have to ask people the question

35:29.680 --> 35:35.120
is, what do you want to spend your days doing? Right? You know, do you actually want to spend your

35:35.120 --> 35:40.000
days putting out on Twitter that you've got a free water bottle this week? Or do you actually

35:40.000 --> 35:45.520
want to go solve a hard problem? Right? You know, I'm an engineer. My favorite movie in the

35:45.520 --> 35:50.080
world is Apollo 13, not because of the astronauts, but because when the guy comes in, he dumps

35:50.080 --> 35:55.120
the stuff on the table and says, you know, folks, we got to put this into this to get these people home.

35:55.120 --> 36:00.400
And the engineers rise to the occasion. And that's the way we feel about, about talent.

36:00.400 --> 36:05.040
You know, we'll give you something hard to do. Let's go do it. And that helps with our creating

36:05.040 --> 36:10.000
and helps with, with keeping people energized. And so we're actually doing great on that.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.160
If anybody wants to come join us and give it a go, we're more than happy to have that discussion.

36:14.160 --> 36:19.680
Awesome. Awesome. Well, Jack, thanks so much for joining us and sharing a bit about what

36:19.680 --> 36:49.520
you're up to there. Great. Thank you. I've really enjoyed the conversation.
