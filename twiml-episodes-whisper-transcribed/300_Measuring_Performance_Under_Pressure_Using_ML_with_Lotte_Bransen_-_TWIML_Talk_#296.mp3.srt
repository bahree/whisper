16
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,200
All right everyone, I am on the line with Lata Branson, Lata is a scientific researcher

17
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,520
at Sci Sports, Lata welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

18
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,880
Well, thank you, I'm happy to be here. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to chatting

19
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,120
with you.

20
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:58,000
You are in the enviable position of having combined a couple of your life's passions.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,560
You've been playing soccer since the age of five and now you get to study it and apply

22
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:12,000
machine learning to the analysis of that sport and others as well, or are you primarily

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,840
focused on soccer right now?

24
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,600
I'm just focused on soccer right now.

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Yeah.

26
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
So how did this all come to be?

27
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:25,440
Well, as you already mentioned, I played soccer my whole my life and I did a bachelor's

28
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,520
in mathematics and while I was studying, I found out of this company called Sci Sports

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:38,360
that was using, was combining mathematics and soccer to get insights in what players

30
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
clubs should buy.

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,480
So then I contacted the company and the company back then was just run by three students

32
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,000
and just the beginning of the company, around five years ago and I kept in contact.

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,640
I worked there like one day a week and then I started doing my master's in econometrics

34
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,040
and at the end of my master's I could work at the company as a scientific researcher.

35
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,000
So that's how it all started.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,720
And the company's based in Amsterdam?

37
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,200
It's based in, oh, it started and it's today, it's like in the east of the country.

38
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,200
Okay.

39
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,160
It's a very small country so that's around two hours from Amsterdam.

40
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Okay.

41
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:23,440
And we also have an office in Amesford right now that is like in the middle of Netherlands.

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,160
And from the time you started working there when it was just that three students, it's

43
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,240
grown to what now?

44
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,520
To around 50 people right now.

45
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,960
So just six years, big growth.

46
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:41,200
Talk a little bit about before we dive into the specific paper that we'll be speaking

47
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,520
about.

48
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,160
Talk a little bit about kind of your general area of research there.

49
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,160
Yeah.

50
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,800
So we are at Seismort.

51
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,920
We help multiple different clients but our main focus is on the recruitment part for

52
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,920
Clubs.

53
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,960
So actually, Clubs want to find new players for their teams and that's where we help.

54
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,960
And in our team, our data analytics team, we built our new models, mainly using machine

55
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:14,840
learning to get insights from this data that we get.

56
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,600
And that's how we, what we hope to Clubs.

57
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,960
And we have like an online platform where while our clients can find around $19,000,

58
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,560
$90,000 players from all over the world and can find their strengths and weaknesses.

59
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,960
And well, that's how that helped them.

60
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
Okay.

61
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,320
What are some of the main data sources that you have access to for the various analytics

62
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
that you do?

63
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,320
Yeah.

64
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,960
We got access to match event data as it is called.

65
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,680
We get us from our partner, Wisecout.

66
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,640
And this data that is like many of the annotated, like for every action that occurs on the pitch.

67
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,840
So in the past, it rippled across.

68
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,520
So annotated, which player performs this action from where to where, or what time in the match.

69
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,440
And that's the kind of data that we deal with daily.

70
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:16,200
Okay. And so the data is kind of a set of time series events or, yeah, it is, yeah.

71
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:22,200
Okay. And are there other data source providers that are doing things with more imagery or

72
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:27,800
video-based data, or is that not prevalent in soccer yet?

73
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,800
It is.

74
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,040
We have a part of our company is working on that.

75
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,560
We have a special team called the Bo James team.

76
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,680
And they are working on the scammer system, which currently hangs in three stadiums.

77
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,800
And that is like using this computer vision to attract the players and the ball at each

78
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,400
moment, each time in the game.

79
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,680
So that's also what we're doing.

80
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,480
So we're also collecting data with my team is primarily focused on event data for the

81
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,080
clubs, because, well, two scout players, you have to know a lot about all these players

82
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,080
around the world.

83
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,800
And this video data is not yet provided for a lot of leaks.

84
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,360
So that's why makes sense, makes sense.

85
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,320
So the paper that we are going to dig into is one that you presented earlier this year

86
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:23,240
at the Sloan Sports Analytics conference is called choke or shine, quantifying soccer

87
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,280
players' ability to perform under mental pressure.

88
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,800
Tell us a little bit about the motivations for this paper.

89
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,640
Yeah, so, well, it's about quantifying what it says, the stroke and place abilities to

90
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,720
perform under mental pressure.

91
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,160
And what we actually want to do is, well, we saw there's a lot of research in stroke

92
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,600
or analytics, current leads, it's growing fastly, but there's never any research quantitatively

93
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,080
done about how players perform under mental pressure.

94
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,920
And I've also, as a soccer player myself, I also feel this pressure sometimes, so it's

95
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:03,040
actually how we came well with this topic.

96
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,440
Yeah, so we wanted to measure the performance of these players when the pressure is getting

97
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
high.

98
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:13,120
So we had to access to the data for this, and that's actually how we start this research

99
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,800
and we did a collaboration with two people from the KL over, Peter and Jesse, and another

100
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,720
colleague of mine, Jan, we did this research.

101
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,440
And is applying some kind of machine learning or analytics to mental pressure?

102
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,800
Is that something that you've seen done in other fields?

103
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,880
Is it, you know, prevalent in some other fields?

104
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,840
And it's something you're trying to bring to soccer or is it something that we don't

105
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,200
really do a lot of now in sports?

106
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,720
It has been investigated in some other sports, but not extensively yet.

107
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,840
So I think it's still a field that needs to be investigated more.

108
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,080
We also want to do more in a research of this.

109
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,120
And we've spoken to quite some mental coaches that work at different clubs, and they always

110
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:06,200
tell us that they have like, it's hard for them to show like the improvement of certain

111
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:11,080
players on certain aspects of the mental game.

112
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:17,400
And I think, well, in soccer, it's well in all sports, it's very important that the

113
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,000
mentality is correct.

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,920
So you can perform on a mental pressure because that's when the points are being made.

115
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,720
So yeah, yeah.

116
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:34,080
And so how are you in your research defining mental pressure and how are you characterizing

117
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,320
it in the games that you're looking at?

118
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Yeah.

119
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,040
So actually what we did, we defined two aspects of mental pressure.

120
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,960
So the pre-game pressure and the in-game pressure.

121
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,600
So you can imagine that before a game starts, there's already some pressure on certain games.

122
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,840
For example, when you're playing a game for a championship, like in the primary leagues,

123
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:00,600
like I think it was 10 years ago, something like that, maybe less.

124
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,000
When a city and United, Manchester City United, both could be the champions, well, then

125
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,760
the pressure is getting high.

126
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,240
And we also investigated in-game mental pressure, and that's based on an in-game win probability

127
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,240
model.

128
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,960
So at each point in time, we predict, well, the win probability for both of the teams.

129
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:29,680
And when a goal has been scored, when this in-game win probability will change a lot,

130
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,000
then we say like the pressure is high.

131
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,680
So for example, when it's like a one-one in the last minutes, then pressure is really

132
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:42,840
high because when you score a goal, so mainly change the winner of the game, then there's

133
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,840
already a three-zero score on the board, then it doesn't matter anymore.

134
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:56,920
And so you've kind of characterized games by this low pressure, high pressure, or at least

135
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:03,440
the pre-game is the pressure is at the level of the game.

136
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,240
But the in-game, that's an attribute you're applying to the games, is it minute by minute

137
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,240
or event by event, or I guess it's just whenever the score changes?

138
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,800
Yeah, so that's actually whenever it's actually minute by minute.

139
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,520
So it's, yeah, so when the score changes, it will immediately affect this model.

140
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:30,600
And it takes into account the current score also like whether our red cards, yellow cards,

141
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,800
and the kind of stuff.

142
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:38,880
And also when a team is attacking a lot, they also account for that in the in-game win-pobility

143
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,880
model.

144
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,040
So yeah, that's it.

145
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:48,760
And like for the pre-game model, it's like a fixed set number per game, yeah.

146
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:53,600
And those two combined make like the pressure at a certain event in a game.

147
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,920
Okay.

148
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:01,760
And so you've got the pressure on the one hand and you're trying to use that to predict

149
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,080
what?

150
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,120
So we actually have depression on the one hand and on the other hand, we have actually

151
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,160
three performance metrics.

152
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,960
So for every action that we have, so this pass or a dribble, we compute three things.

153
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:25,720
So the contribution of this action, so by contribution, we mean the increase in scoring

154
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,520
a goal in the near future.

155
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,520
So actually for every action, we put the value of the game before the action and after

156
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,920
the action.

157
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,360
And the difference in those two makes the contribution of an action.

158
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,280
And next to that, we also measured the position, the quality of the decision and the quality

159
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,000
of the execution.

160
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,840
And those three, for those three values, we can see like how does a player perform.

161
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:54,720
But when the pressure is like in a normal normal state, when it's getting high and when

162
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,000
it's getting lower, and this is more like for descriptive analysis of all those players.

163
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,440
This contribution element, it sounds like that saying that at a given time in the game,

164
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,240
given all of the player positions and some event that just happened, you're able to come

165
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,400
up with some metric that captures kind of the relative advantage of the different teams

166
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,120
that in and of itself sounds like a hard problem.

167
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Yeah, it is.

168
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,920
Yeah, so we, that was actually how this all started.

169
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:34,360
So I think a year before this paper, we worked on a model to measure these contributions

170
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,400
for other players.

171
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:43,720
So what this actually does is for each game state, that's how we call it.

172
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:50,120
So every game state is like characterized by all the actions that have been played until

173
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:57,840
then the position of the player with the ball, the time in the match, the score difference.

174
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:04,520
And for every game state, we predict the chance that within 10 actions goals being scored

175
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,000
by the one team.

176
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,800
So it's actually like a binary classification problem.

177
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,600
And we also, on the other hand, we also predict the chance that the other team will score

178
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,600
within 10 actions.

179
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,360
And in this way, we can measure like for every action, we can measure the offensive and

180
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,120
the other hand, the defensive contribution.

181
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,600
So for example, when a player passes the ball from his own half to his striker, this will

182
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,200
have like a very high contribution, a offensive contribution, without an other end, if you

183
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,440
interceptable in your own box, you will also have a high defensive contribution.

184
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,160
And that's what we, well, we were first worked on.

185
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,920
And this is also something that we already showed to our clients and they can find like

186
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,040
players that have like, for example, high ball's contribution, they can easily spot

187
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,280
talents before other others do.

188
00:13:54,280 --> 00:14:00,640
With that original work on contribution, okay, there's a couple of questions there.

189
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:07,920
One, when you're looking at player position, like do you quantize that in some way or is

190
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,160
it kind of continuous position in the field?

191
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,840
Do you mean like with position, I mean, where, where the player is with the ball?

192
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,840
Okay.

193
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,160
Or do you even look at where the players are that don't have the ball?

194
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,840
Yeah, that's, that's a good point.

195
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:26,200
That's one of the, well, disadvantages of the event data.

196
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:31,280
So with this event data, we only have all the actions that happen with the ball.

197
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,760
So we have to pass the dribbles, but we don't know where all the other, well, 21 players

198
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
are.

199
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,760
Yeah.

200
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,760
So that's, well, that is.

201
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,400
Did you call that an advantage or a disadvantage?

202
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
Disadvantage.

203
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,640
Because it makes you problem easier.

204
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:52,640
Well, no, no, we, I would really love to have this, this data as well.

205
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,640
Yeah.

206
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,920
We currently don't have that.

207
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,280
But we also captured, well, we tried to capture this with, by adding information about

208
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,280
the attack.

209
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,080
So we, we add information about speed of the game.

210
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:10,400
So, so in, in the soccer, you have quite a lot of counter attacks.

211
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,800
So you know, like when the game moved fast or the ball moved fast to the other half, then

212
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,800
we know, like, this is a different situation than when the ball was, when it was a very

213
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
slow attack.

214
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,800
So that's the kind of things that we try to, to account for.

215
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,600
But yeah, we don't have these always locations now.

216
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
Yeah.

217
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Yeah.

218
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,800
It does seem like there is potentially an interesting element of player contribution that

219
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,480
is, you know, being in the right place at the right time that can't be captured in your

220
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,480
car model.

221
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,480
That's true.

222
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,800
But we're also looking at where a player receives the ball.

223
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,800
And that also already tells a lot about his positioning.

224
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Okay.

225
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,640
But it was, yeah.

226
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,760
So if you, you often receive the ball in the, in the opponent's box, that says a lot

227
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,400
about his positioning that we've seen.

228
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:03,720
And so back to that positioning question, are you, like, do you kind of split the field

229
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,520
up into zones or, you know, meter by meter squares or something like that?

230
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,040
Are you using kind of absolute positioning?

231
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,040
Yeah.

232
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:20,920
We, we get it, like, in meter by meter, that's actually also what we use in the, so actually

233
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,760
you have the, it's annotated as like 100, 100 pitch.

234
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:33,240
And then we normalize it to like the, the normal pitch sizes in Europe or in, like, I

235
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,960
think, over, over all the world.

236
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,520
So that's how you, so it's a kind of meter by meter, yeah.

237
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
All right.

238
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,040
So you've got this contribution data.

239
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:50,280
And that becomes the, that's another one of the inputs to your, your choke or shine model.

240
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:55,000
Actually, is it the, is it the contribution that's trying to predict whether a point will

241
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,520
be scored in 10 actions or is that the, yeah, yeah, that's a contribution.

242
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,080
So actually that's the contribution is the difference in scoring a goal before your action

243
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,080
and after your action.

244
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,080
Ah, got it.

245
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,880
So if, so for example, if you have a bit on your own, the chance of scoring a goal within

246
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,480
10, 10 actions will be very low.

247
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,360
And then if it after the action is very, is higher than it's the difference between those.

248
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,200
And if you lose the ball, you get negative contribution ratings.

249
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:32,280
And so then you're taking this and as an input, and then using this to, I'm trying to get

250
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,320
back to the choke or shine model.

251
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,880
How does the contribution play into the mental pressure model?

252
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,600
So what we actually do is we investigate the moments in which the, well, actually we

253
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,360
investigate how what a normal contribution is for a certain player.

254
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,160
So in that way, we can, can identify the tenants, for example.

255
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:03,560
So we did this for the MLS, for example, we saw that, let's me see the names, a font

256
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:11,600
of Davies and Barco and Adams started Adams were in like in the 2018 season, when I like

257
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,080
to play with the highest contribution ratings in, in the MLS.

258
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,840
So what we actually do, we have this contribution ratings per action.

259
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:24,200
And if we then sum up all these ratings for a certain player, and then we normalize

260
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,680
this per, per 90 minutes of play, then we can actually say like what is this average

261
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,720
contribution for, for a game.

262
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,280
And then when we looked at, for example, a font of Davies, when the pressure was normal,

263
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,160
he belongs to the best players in the, in the league, but actually when the pressure is

264
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:45,600
getting high, he belongs to like more like an average player, even below average.

265
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,600
Okay.

266
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,760
So that was the kind of the insight that we were looking for, to see like how the players

267
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:58,600
perform, when this pressure is normal or high or low, so actually we've been the pressure

268
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,560
levels that we had in like three bins, and that's how we identified this.

269
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,760
And because we saw like, okay, we see this contribution is changing, but we also wanted

270
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,800
to know like, why is this changing?

271
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,080
And then we came up with the idea like, okay, the contribution rating of a player, it depends

272
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,480
actually on two things.

273
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:21,880
So contribution of an action depends actually on the choice that you made, and also on

274
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,400
how you execute this action.

275
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:28,560
So the choice can be to, to play the ball to your striker as a defender, but if you don't

276
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,080
execute it well, you will never get a high contribution.

277
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:36,840
And on the hand, if you make a wrong choice, but you execute the action in a good way,

278
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,640
then it's also will not give you a high contribution rating.

279
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,640
So that's what we're kind of looking for.

280
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:48,560
So to see why these ratings are changing for certain players.

281
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,200
So that's actually what we did, and we also looked into more like tactical analysis.

282
00:19:53,200 --> 00:20:00,960
So for example, Manchester United, they tend to dribble less, dribble more when the pressure

283
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,080
is getting high, but actually their contribution from the dribbles is decreasing.

284
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,720
So they're choosing to dribble, then it's not a good decision to do that.

285
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,120
So that's kind of the insight that we were looking at.

286
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:21,800
And so were you able to arrive at the decision-making and execution as were these outputs of this

287
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,160
model or were these inputs to the model?

288
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,280
It was like inputs to the complete model, yeah.

289
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,360
So these are also based on the data that we got here.

290
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:37,240
So you have this data that's telling you if a pass is made and then is execution just

291
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,440
telling you if the pass was completed or if it was not completed.

292
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:47,040
And so does it, it doesn't really take into account defense contribution at all.

293
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,720
No, this is focused on the difficulty of the action.

294
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,720
So if you pause a long board and you manage to succeed, you will get a higher execution

295
00:20:58,720 --> 00:20:59,720
rating.

296
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:06,800
But also like a tech also, tech also defensive action, it can also be unsuccessful or

297
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:10,280
you can also make a file in your own box.

298
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,600
So it also does take into account defensive actions.

299
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:19,440
But while we know that using event data, it's very hard to rate players on the defensive

300
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,320
actions, because while more things happen with the ball in offense, so that's that hard.

301
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,200
Yeah, that's one of the legs of the data.

302
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:37,680
And is the data, is there, is it labeled or rated in terms of the intended target for

303
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,720
a pass or is it just that a pass happened and the next event is whether the, you know,

304
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,560
the pass was received or if someone intercepted it.

305
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:53,280
Yeah, that's actually, we know the end location of the pass or we know the direction of it.

306
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,000
And in that way, we can kind of predict where it was going to, yeah.

307
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Okay.

308
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,320
So we know the end location.

309
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Yeah.

310
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,320
All right.

311
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,120
So tell us a little bit about the process of coming up with the, this model.

312
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,480
How did you start and what were some of the things that you tried?

313
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:17,040
So well, we actually started with like having lots of discussions and while thinking of how

314
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,480
we want to want to measure this.

315
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,200
So well, as I said before, we work together with two people from the living university.

316
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,680
So they visited us and coslaven is in Belgium.

317
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:35,240
So they visited us at, at Amosford, at our office and we had just had like one big, just

318
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,960
discussing, no programming, just discussing how we wanted to do this.

319
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:44,200
And that's how we came up with the different models that we wanted to capture.

320
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:50,400
And our main thing was you also wanted to try as much as possible and get, see how far

321
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,120
we got in all of those aspects.

322
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:59,680
And we know like some things are hard to capture with the data that we have.

323
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,000
So we first started with how to, we already had this contribution ratings.

324
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,160
So we tried to improve those, train it on more data, try some different models for that.

325
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:17,000
And the main focus was in beginning on how to measure this, this meant pressure.

326
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:25,000
So for the free game, meant pressure model, we wanted to, well, we needed some kind of

327
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,320
ground food to train this model.

328
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,320
So that's why we, we'll talk to some soccer experts, it's how we call them.

329
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,720
So soccer players, trainers, coaches, scouts from clubs and we let them, well, we made

330
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:45,080
like a tool where they could like rank games and we gave them information about this game.

331
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:51,720
So was it in the beginning of the season, what is the ranking of the, of the league, what

332
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,680
is the goal of the team, that kind of stuff.

333
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:56,440
And then they, they could rank those, those teams.

334
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,120
So it was like a pair of white ranking.

335
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:04,640
And we use this to train, to train our pre game meant pressure model.

336
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:09,200
So in this model, we make use of, well, different features.

337
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:15,880
So as I said before, the ranking of the team, how long the season is already been played.

338
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,880
So where in the season are we?

339
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,800
And also like on what spot are they?

340
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,760
So if they are playing for your, your opa league spots, then the pressure will be higher

341
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:28,520
than when they already medicated, for example.

342
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,200
So that's actually how we started by making this tool and collecting as much input as possible

343
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,520
or also talking to these people to ask them what do you think is like important when

344
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,240
you feel the pressure.

345
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,160
It's actually how it started and then we kept on improving.

346
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:57,520
And so with that, the pressure model, were you training against subjective labels of whether

347
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,200
a game was high pressure or not?

348
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:07,000
Yeah, so actually the rank labels by the experts, yeah.

349
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Okay.

350
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,440
So that's the pressure model.

351
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,440
And then what kind of model did you use for that?

352
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,120
So for the pre game pressure model, we use it's gradient boosted ranking trees.

353
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:27,240
And for the in game, mental pressure model, that's so for that model, we wanted to predict

354
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:33,040
that every time, so every minute in the game, the sum of the goals, the number of goals

355
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,800
that both teams would score.

356
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:39,640
And then we could like predict the probabilities of win, draw and loss.

357
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:47,120
And for this model, we made use of the out of the French stations, variational inference

358
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,640
of a bi-MC tree.

359
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:56,800
And we trained this on all the data that we had up until the 2017 to 2018 season.

360
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:03,280
So yeah, that's actually how we trained these two models and the combination of those

361
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,280
two pressure models.

362
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:09,960
So the in game and the pre game, it makes us the pressure model.

363
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,640
How are those combined?

364
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,960
Yeah, so that's where we also had, well, difficulty.

365
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,400
What difficulty is like, it's very hard to, I think in the, I think it's many areas,

366
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:29,400
but in sports, it's kind of hard if you don't really have a ground truth.

367
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:34,160
So in the end, we decided to multiply those two numbers.

368
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,800
So it's the in game and the pre game.

369
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:43,080
So when the pre game pressure is high, but in the game, it quickly gets to a 3.0 score,

370
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:49,520
so there's not really high pressure anymore than the total pressure will be low as well.

371
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,640
But we certainly wanted to do, want to do more investigation in this.

372
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,720
You should just collect more information on that.

373
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,200
You mentioned some of the kind of surprising findings from looking at some of the MLS

374
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:08,160
players, were there any other kind of interesting surprises in when you started applying these

375
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,160
results?

376
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:16,680
Yeah, there were like lots of results that we, some that we already, that we also expected.

377
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:21,760
For example, that Cristiano Ronaldo is like very constant in the pressure.

378
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:29,040
So what is not, nothing new maybe, but that was felt good to see this, but for Neymar.

379
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:37,000
So when he was still playing it by Barcelona, his performance goes down in the pressure.

380
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,880
So then he's like more like an average player, whilst when the pressure is lower, he belongs

381
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,000
like to the best of the league.

382
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,360
And then what we also find really interesting is that Liverpool tends to buy players that

383
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,760
perform well on the pressure.

384
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:59,320
So there's actually just something that we found by accident, but it's interesting to

385
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,320
see.

386
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:07,200
So in their signings, from the last three seasons, were all except for Kaita, they were all

387
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,720
like performing way better under pressure than under low pressure.

388
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,280
So that was interesting to see.

389
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:19,440
Do you think there's anything interesting in looking at kind of the overall team composition

390
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,360
of players that perform better in low pressure versus high pressure?

391
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,120
Are there any interesting ideas there?

392
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,040
Yeah, so we also also looked at that.

393
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,000
So we wanted to show as many applications as possible.

394
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,800
So we looked at what the defenders of Reventus, for example, and we saw that there are two

395
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:48,720
players, Benassia and Bulushi, who like perform way better when the pressure is high and

396
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,080
like two others, Kilini and Rugani perform way worse under pressure.

397
00:28:54,080 --> 00:29:00,640
So this might help coaches to select the players to let them play in a certain match.

398
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:07,360
So when you're playing like a Champions League final, you might choose Benassia over Kilini.

399
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,960
So yeah, there's also some interesting insights in there.

400
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:19,960
So this then goes a bit beyond the kind of scouting use cases that you tend to focus on

401
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,440
and could be something that is useful for tactical planning by coaches.

402
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,920
Yeah, definitely.

403
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:33,680
Yeah, we also, well, we started focusing on the scouting, but we currently also like doing

404
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,320
other stuff for clubs.

405
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,440
So we helped them, for example, with the opponent analysis.

406
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,200
So finding the weaknesses and strengths of their opponents.

407
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:49,480
For example, at previous World Cup, the men's World Cup, I must say, there was, we helped

408
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:57,280
the Belgium team, like analyzing their opponents, although they came until the semi-finals,

409
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,280
so that was nice as well.

410
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,080
So that's also where this could be very helpful, yeah.

411
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,360
And what I said before, also for mental coaches that want to show the stuff, how their

412
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,320
progress is with certain players is also very helpful to have something to measure this.

413
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,040
So it could be used for many things, yeah.

414
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:23,760
You certainly learned a lot about the kind of the application of some of these models

415
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,320
to this problem, but were there any interesting kind of fundamental learnings or observations

416
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:37,600
on the part of your team about applying these kinds of models to the kinds of data that

417
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,600
you're applying it to?

418
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,160
It was interesting to see that there are differences between certain players, but I think

419
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,720
definitely we need to investigate more, whether we can also like make it more like a predictive

420
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,920
thing to predict the performance of players in the future.

421
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:55,200
So we're looking into that right now.

422
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,560
But yeah, I think the main insight is that there's lots of users to be done still on this

423
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,560
field.

424
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:08,800
And that we are able to capture certain things, to capture contributions of players and

425
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:13,400
in a better way than just looking at the number of goalscord, because in soccer there's

426
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,760
like on average just two goals per game.

427
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:22,280
So it definitely doesn't always say that the one team was better than the other.

428
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:26,560
So yeah, we found some interesting insights in there.

429
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:32,920
Where did you find the most challenges from a technical perspective?

430
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,320
Good question.

431
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:42,040
Well, it was really hard to get the in-game win probability model working well.

432
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:50,600
I think also like the hard thing is to get this ground truth in soccer, that's where we

433
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,680
have to deal with.

434
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,320
We don't have the locations of the other players.

435
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,040
So that was for the decision rating model very hard as well.

436
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:07,920
So I think that's what from technical side was hard to get it all working in a good way.

437
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:12,760
And I think also, yeah, not just from technical side, but one of the problems is I think to

438
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:19,200
get this message across to people from the industry, from the soccer world.

439
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:27,440
So just the applicability of machine learning and analytics in general, or the specifically

440
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,280
around looking at mental pressure.

441
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:38,600
I think in general, but especially in mental pressure, also like the mental aspect of

442
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:46,600
the game, if analyzing the mental aspect is very new in most sports, and then also using

443
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:53,920
data for that is like for people in the soccer industry that's maybe a bit too early right

444
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,920
now.

445
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
Right.

446
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,920
Right.

447
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,920
Yeah.

448
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:03,480
So we tried to inform them how they could use this.

449
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,680
So that's also what we're investigating right now, how we can best present this to the

450
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
users.

451
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:13,960
I should have asked this earlier, but assuming that kind of the testing of your models

452
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:22,280
was done against kind of held out data, did you, how do you test this against kind of

453
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,040
real world scenarios, have you done any of that?

454
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,040
Yeah.

455
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:31,440
So for example, the, well, actually often models, we used like three seasons of data for

456
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,440
that, like to train the models, and to validate it on another season.

457
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,200
And then the results were presented on the, well, on the season that we didn't train

458
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,960
over the data on.

459
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,560
So for example, for the, for the contribution rating aspect, we have like, we have like

460
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,560
the ground truth.

461
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:54,640
It's like the label is when it goes being scored within 10 actions, the label will be one

462
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,800
and you'll otherwise zero.

463
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,000
So that's how we, well, how we trained that model.

464
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,120
For the others, we, for the pressure model, as explained, we used the ranking provided

465
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,080
by the experts to get that one working.

466
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,080
Very good.

467
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:15,840
Well, a lot to thank you so much for taking the time to chat with us about your paper.
