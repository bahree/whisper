00:00.000 --> 00:06.060
Hey what's up everyone this is Sam. Today is a very special day for me and the

00:06.060 --> 00:11.720
entire Twilmal team. After over 1200 days of podcasting interviews with guests

00:11.720 --> 00:16.920
from six of the seven continents and Antarctica we see you. Nearly six

00:16.920 --> 00:22.640
million downloads and less than two weeks away from our very first conference we

00:22.640 --> 00:30.680
are ecstatic to bring you the 300th episode of the show.

00:30.680 --> 00:34.920
coinciding with this important milestone I am excited to share that we'll be

00:34.920 --> 00:40.200
rolling out updates to the Twilmal brand over the next few weeks. When I

00:40.200 --> 00:44.480
launched this week in machine learning and AI I never imagined that I'd be

00:44.480 --> 00:49.120
meeting new people who'd see my name or hear my voice and say hey you're the

00:49.120 --> 00:53.600
Twilmal guy. Not to say the Twilmal is a household name or anything like that but

00:53.600 --> 00:58.840
we love this and are embracing it. With that in mind the show will now be known

00:58.840 --> 01:03.760
as the Twilmal AI podcast. If you head over to Twilmal AI.com you can check out

01:03.760 --> 01:07.720
our new logo and the refresh show graphics that accompany this change.

01:07.720 --> 01:13.200
Obviously we want to know what you think of our new look so please reach out via

01:13.200 --> 01:18.440
email, Twitter, the show notes page, carrier pigeon or whatever works best for

01:18.440 --> 01:23.240
you. And now on to the 300th show.

01:24.360 --> 01:29.880
All right everyone I am on the line with Kalai Ramia. Kalai is a data scientist

01:29.880 --> 01:35.480
at Park, the storied Xerox research organization. Kalai welcome to this

01:35.480 --> 01:39.960
week in machine learning and AI. Thank you Sam. Thanks for having me. It's great

01:39.960 --> 01:45.400
to be here. It is great to have you on the show. You come at data science with a

01:45.400 --> 01:50.080
background in transportation and that certainly influences some of the

01:50.080 --> 01:53.320
research that we'll be talking about today. But I'd love to hear a little bit

01:53.320 --> 01:57.400
more about your story and how you came to be interested in the intersection of

01:57.400 --> 02:03.640
these fields. Sure. So my undergrad and grad background like Master's

02:03.640 --> 02:09.160
background was in transportation systems. So I was working on a lot of you

02:09.160 --> 02:13.720
know spatial design of transportation networks and all those things. I was

02:13.720 --> 02:17.480
getting bored a little bit of doing the same things again. So I went to grad

02:17.480 --> 02:23.640
school in a super interdisciplinary program which involves transportation, energy

02:23.640 --> 02:29.960
systems, econometrics, environment. So I don't even know how to describe it in

02:29.960 --> 02:35.720
one sentence what I did. But I had like four advices just to give a

02:35.720 --> 02:40.200
taste of how that was. I'm starting to you know I believe that the

02:40.200 --> 02:46.200
harder it is to describe what you do the more interesting it is.

02:46.200 --> 02:51.560
Yeah. So I'll try anyway. So I worked on something called integrated assessment

02:51.560 --> 02:57.640
models. So these are the models they use it to inform for example the IPCC

02:57.640 --> 03:01.640
reports for climate change. It is an intergovernmental panel for climate

03:01.640 --> 03:05.000
change. So if they want to inform the public like what's going to happen in a

03:05.000 --> 03:09.720
two degrees Celsius policy, then these are all the things that be

03:09.720 --> 03:14.360
saying this report using this mathematical model. And this is a humongous

03:14.360 --> 03:20.600
model where we solve each sector in a Rubik's cube format looking at what are

03:20.600 --> 03:25.240
the cost effective pathways for transportation to achieve the climate goals

03:25.240 --> 03:29.080
or for residential even like what would be the right amount of LED lights we need to

03:29.080 --> 03:35.000
have to achieve this efficiency criteria and so on. So that was my

03:35.000 --> 03:40.040
PhD program. So I like I mentioned like I worked with all kinds of fields to

03:40.040 --> 03:45.560
build this humongous model. And I my specialty or my

03:45.560 --> 03:49.880
dissertation was focusing on like including human behavior in

03:49.880 --> 03:53.960
light duty papers like how people will be able to purchase different kinds of

03:53.960 --> 03:56.520
new technologies and how that will lead to

03:56.520 --> 04:03.080
climate goals. So that was the essence of it. And while I was doing that in my

04:03.080 --> 04:06.920
grad school, I was getting familiar with machine learning

04:06.920 --> 04:11.480
and advanced data science techniques. And I spent a little bit of that in my

04:11.480 --> 04:19.000
postdoc on a special data. Then I joined Park. So that's when like I started my

04:19.000 --> 04:23.080
you know interest in deep learning systems and other things on a variety of

04:23.080 --> 04:26.360
projects. That sounds like a lot of fun. And the

04:26.360 --> 04:33.000
work that we're going to be digging into today is focused on an analysis of

04:33.000 --> 04:39.320
the infrastructure to support alternative fuel vehicles. Can you talk more about

04:39.320 --> 04:44.360
your research in that area and how that specific line of inquiry came to be?

04:44.360 --> 04:49.960
Yeah so in that particular paper you're talking about I did the analysis on

04:49.960 --> 04:56.120
hydrogen fueling stations. So are you aware of fuel cell vehicles?

04:56.120 --> 05:03.640
At the super high level. Yeah but I'd love to hear your kind of take on where we are

05:03.640 --> 05:09.080
with those. Okay so I drive one. That is all you need to know right now.

05:09.080 --> 05:14.280
So they exist. They're out on the road. That is the genesis of why I started this

05:14.280 --> 05:20.520
paper. So I got otherwise commercially called the hydrogen

05:20.520 --> 05:26.440
car. So since I wanted to like you know I have a long drive from East Bay to Palo

05:26.440 --> 05:31.800
Alto. So I kept driving on a gasoline vehicles. I was feeling guilty. So I wanted to

05:31.800 --> 05:36.360
get a zero emissions vehicle right. Everybody was going for electric.

05:36.360 --> 05:40.600
So since I worked on these different kinds of transportation technologies I

05:40.600 --> 05:44.920
wanted to see like how would it be to drive a hydrogen car.

05:44.920 --> 05:50.040
So that was how my research started you know then I got a hydrogen car.

05:50.040 --> 05:53.320
So the way things vehicles go ahead you had some questions.

05:53.320 --> 06:00.120
I will say that I did not associate fuel cell and hydrogen. I very ignorant in that area.

06:00.120 --> 06:06.600
I thought when I think of fuel cell I associate that with alternative battery technology

06:06.600 --> 06:11.960
like that we might see in phones or computers or even cars and hydrogen.

06:11.960 --> 06:17.960
I don't know how I envisioned thus getting the hydrogen into the cars but I did not

06:17.960 --> 06:21.640
associate that with fuel cell and I did not realize that they were

06:21.640 --> 06:26.920
broadly available today. Yeah see you know something. I need exactly right

06:26.920 --> 06:32.440
fuel cell are similar to batteries. So the fuel cells work in a way

06:32.440 --> 06:37.880
battery does like what it works in a Tesla or a bolt except that you

06:37.880 --> 06:42.360
give hydrogen to fuel cells and then they convert that to electricity and that drives the car.

06:42.360 --> 06:46.760
So they are essentially electric cars but then they need hydrogen to produce the

06:46.760 --> 06:51.320
electricity that's the only difference. Okay. So the way they work is you know

06:51.320 --> 06:58.600
California is the pioneer in this technology so they have about like 32 or 35 hydrogen

06:58.600 --> 07:03.560
stations all over the state and Bay Area and Southern California are big in this network.

07:03.560 --> 07:08.360
They have multiple stations. That's one of the main criteria to buy or you know to

07:08.360 --> 07:12.760
lease a hydrogen vehicle. So I will get to the machine learning part in a bit.

07:12.760 --> 07:18.680
Meaning from a consumer perspective if I don't find a fueling station I'm probably not

07:18.680 --> 07:24.680
going to want to buy one of these. Exactly. And I imagine it's it's not like an electric vehicle

07:24.680 --> 07:30.840
where I can just get a box and attach it to my house and you know be able to charge my car.

07:32.120 --> 07:37.400
The hydrogen infrastructure at the home is non-existent. You don't want that. And dangerous.

07:37.400 --> 07:44.600
Yes. Yeah. Exactly right. So that's why having a public hydrogen station is very important

07:44.600 --> 07:47.800
and having a reliable public hydrogen station is very very important.

07:48.760 --> 07:54.680
Fortunately I live in Union City so there is one in Fremont and there's one in Hayward

07:54.680 --> 07:59.800
and I work in Palo Alto and there's one in Mountain View at the time when I got the car.

07:59.800 --> 08:06.840
So I was very excited. So the fueling system is very similar to gasoline. So I was doing that.

08:06.840 --> 08:13.080
And then over a period of time I realized like some stations do really badly in these.

08:13.080 --> 08:19.400
Like you go there and then suddenly there's no fuel or there's line or you know there's

08:19.400 --> 08:25.160
all sorts of problems. And then the other stations I started to rely more and more.

08:25.160 --> 08:31.160
And I was looking for some kind of data for this. Like is there a data driven reliability that I

08:31.160 --> 08:36.920
can actually look up so that when I want to refuel I can go there directly. And there wasn't one.

08:36.920 --> 08:43.320
So I started collecting the data. So their California fuel self partnership is the agency that

08:43.320 --> 08:50.680
provides this real-time hydrogen availability data online. So I scraped that data for three months

08:50.680 --> 08:59.800
from September, October to December of last year. Every hour. And I wanted to see the time series

08:59.800 --> 09:04.760
and do all those things to analyze where I can go refuel or where anyone can go refuel.

09:06.440 --> 09:12.200
So I did that and then I got you know so when you get a zero emission vehicle you get

09:12.200 --> 09:18.520
rebate from the state. If you are buying a Tesla or a Bolt you can get about $2,500.

09:18.520 --> 09:25.000
And if you're getting a hydrogen car you get about $5,000. And that data is available to the public

09:25.000 --> 09:32.840
anonymized of course. But you can see who got the rebate at a zip code level at census track level

09:32.840 --> 09:39.640
even. So you can get a sense for vehicle density by zip code or census tract. Exactly. So

09:40.520 --> 09:46.760
putting two and two together. So I have this state you fuel consumption data that I collected

09:46.760 --> 09:51.880
or for a period of three months and all I have to match it with the demand and see whether there is

09:51.880 --> 09:57.960
a trend. Obviously there was a trend and you could actually see which stations lag behind

09:58.520 --> 10:04.200
and which stations are overstressed. Like for example if you draw a linear relationship between

10:04.200 --> 10:11.160
demand and supply I was able to visualize in this case Mountain View was not used by people.

10:11.160 --> 10:17.880
So it confirmed my instincts that Mountain View sucks in like I mean the station stops.

10:19.080 --> 10:25.800
So I was happy about that but then I don't know by my own instinct alone. So I did a survey of

10:25.800 --> 10:32.760
100 fuel cell drivers. So we have this Facebook group of hydrogen car drivers that we

10:32.760 --> 10:37.720
talked to each other and you know talk about the fueling difficulties or whatever.

10:37.720 --> 10:46.840
So I put out the question to them. I asked what are some brief seven questions on like what's

10:46.840 --> 10:51.880
their favorite location, what's their least favorite location, what are the things they find

10:52.600 --> 10:59.640
difficult to or why they avoid the station and so on. It so happened that many of them picked

10:59.640 --> 11:05.880
Mountain View as a least favorite station because the one thing I felt which was confirmed by others

11:05.880 --> 11:14.040
it had a different setup than other stations. So and it wasn't user friendly that was something

11:14.040 --> 11:20.600
you know we couldn't have guessed just by looking at the data. And also other things like

11:20.600 --> 11:25.160
you know some stations are overstressed because there are a lot of people queuing up. So which

11:25.160 --> 11:30.920
kind of gives an indication that the station capacity could be increased over time in those places.

11:30.920 --> 11:37.560
So I wrote this paper initially to suggest that to policymakers you know having this kind of

11:37.560 --> 11:44.040
continuous monitoring mechanism would be able to help your you know data driven decisions over time

11:44.040 --> 11:47.800
whether you want to increase the station capacity or do you want to include a new station in that

11:47.800 --> 11:52.440
area because it's overstressed or if there's something wrong going on with it if there's unsafe

11:52.440 --> 11:57.960
location or something different fuel setup it'll be able to identify where it's going on and then

11:57.960 --> 12:04.760
you can fix it. So that was an interesting paper. So once I did that so it was published in

12:04.760 --> 12:09.960
International Journal of Hydrogen Energy and then there was another sister paper that's.

12:09.960 --> 12:16.440
And that paper specifically is the one titled an integrated quantitative qualitative study

12:16.440 --> 12:21.000
to monitor the utilization and assess the perception of hydrogen fueling stations.

12:21.000 --> 12:27.880
Yeah. So I wanted to capture everything in one.

12:29.880 --> 12:35.800
Yeah it was a very fun paper to write because it was based out of my personal experience and

12:35.800 --> 12:45.400
it's full of affirmations like I was right. And here you kind of describe the setup and what your

12:45.400 --> 12:53.000
data sources are. One thing that jumps out at me from your personal experience is that there are

12:53.000 --> 12:59.800
two sides to the demand equation. There's where the cars live but there's also the other side of

12:59.800 --> 13:07.160
the commute where you're going. Were you able to find any data to incorporate that side of the

13:07.160 --> 13:14.200
demand equation into your analysis? Yes. So remember the survey I mentioned. So that was one of the

13:14.200 --> 13:20.440
questions to the drivers. So where do they feel and what was the reason why they choose that station?

13:22.600 --> 13:29.560
For me I wanted it to be close to home because that's where I rely most. So or on the way to commute.

13:30.440 --> 13:36.280
It so happened that about 70% of the people who answered that why they picked the station was

13:36.280 --> 13:45.000
proximity to their house. So that was my assumption as well and that kind of validated this.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.640
And of course this is just a preliminary way of analyzing things and there's always like you

13:49.640 --> 13:56.520
mentioned this demand traffic demand time of day events and all those things that could factor

13:56.520 --> 14:03.720
into these things. But for the initial checking the station performance overall in a broad period of

14:03.720 --> 14:09.720
time I think this might be okay. Okay. So yeah so if you go through the paper I mean there are

14:09.720 --> 14:15.640
these details steps on how I transform the time series into one single metric and all those

14:15.640 --> 14:22.760
details if you like. I can go back to that. And that's in the quantitative qualitative paper?

14:22.760 --> 14:32.040
Yes. Yes. So this initial paper was kind of talking broadly about this problem and integrating

14:32.040 --> 14:38.440
the both the quantitative approaches and the qualitative survey that you did but then you did

14:38.440 --> 14:44.760
another paper that really focused in on the quantitative side and in particular the application

14:44.760 --> 14:49.560
of machine learning to this problem or an application of machine learning to this problem.

14:50.280 --> 14:58.440
Right. So since I have access to this spatial temporal data so it was rich in terms of like

14:58.440 --> 15:04.280
whatever data I collected for three months so it's a very ripe data set to explore different

15:04.280 --> 15:10.120
kinds of problems. In this case I wanted to see if I can do some kind of temporal clustering

15:10.920 --> 15:17.960
to identify the signatures of the usage of these stations over time. So I used a temporal clustering

15:17.960 --> 15:24.040
mechanism. So I was able to find out since I had access to the qualitative survey I was able to

15:24.040 --> 15:30.600
even interpret the results that came out of this model. And so talk a little bit more about the

15:30.600 --> 15:38.360
temporal clustering approach that you used. What exactly was your objective and what specific

15:38.360 --> 15:45.400
techniques did you apply? So the objective was to identify if just by looking at the station

15:45.400 --> 15:51.640
consumption will we be able to see whether can we group these stations into different categories

15:51.640 --> 15:58.200
which the paper describes how it's being done. So I identified like five categories from

15:58.920 --> 16:04.200
the signature of these temporal usage. So the method I followed is something called complexity

16:04.200 --> 16:10.600
invariant temporal clustering. So I got this from a research paper. So the idea behind that is

16:10.600 --> 16:20.920
for use cases and finance or anything any domain related temporal use cases you can actually

16:21.480 --> 16:29.960
find the signatures and in terms of complexities. So you can do clustering of these signatures based

16:29.960 --> 16:37.160
on that and I was able to find five groups of those. So one is the healthy range where we think

16:37.160 --> 16:43.160
the stations perform pretty well. And then the other group is the overstressed where there are beings

16:43.880 --> 16:50.360
you know a lot of people go there more than the predicted demand. And another is where the problem

16:50.360 --> 16:55.640
stations where people do not go and they have a different standards of reporting and such.

16:56.440 --> 17:01.240
And the other are like connector stations and the connector stations are those that are placed

17:01.240 --> 17:09.880
somewhere in between the high demand and low demand stations. So this method I tried with different

17:09.880 --> 17:14.760
kinds of clustering methods and this one the complexity invariant method seemed to perform well

17:15.880 --> 17:22.440
and we were able to hierarchically group these stations into different categories.

17:22.440 --> 17:30.200
Okay so you applied this clustering technique and you're specifically trying to cluster

17:31.400 --> 17:40.280
in in time series and then use the these clusters to identify the specific essentially

17:40.280 --> 17:49.640
categorize the types of fueling stations. Is that right? Yeah if you recall my previous paper so

17:49.640 --> 17:56.440
that identified the relationship between supply and demand. So in this case we are just using

17:56.440 --> 18:05.240
the supply side to identify any problem stations. So by problem stations I mean since I have the

18:05.240 --> 18:11.960
survey data I can tell they are problem stations. So otherwise they are grouped into these different

18:11.960 --> 18:16.520
categories different buckets of stations like there will be like majority of stations

18:16.520 --> 18:22.040
falling into like healthy range bucket and then there there are these groups of five or six stations

18:22.040 --> 18:29.400
that falling into overstressed or underperforming. So the interpretation comes from the qualitative

18:29.400 --> 18:36.040
method that I did but then this involved performing the analysis even without involving the demand

18:36.040 --> 18:44.120
of people. So even if the number of stations scale up in the future we don't have to worry about

18:44.120 --> 18:49.640
who is buying where or who is refueling where that will answer your previous question as well.

18:49.640 --> 18:55.560
So just by looking at the signature of these station usage we can see whether it's performing

18:55.560 --> 19:01.640
in a healthy way or something is wrong with it. And you just referenced the qualitative survey

19:01.640 --> 19:07.160
results but I'm noting the paper this particular paper that we're talking about is unsupervised

19:07.160 --> 19:11.560
temporal clustering to monitor the performance of alternative fueling infrastructure.

19:11.560 --> 19:22.760
So you but you so you didn't use the the qualitative results or of these stations as labels.

19:22.760 --> 19:29.560
No no. Okay. Yeah no labeling done. So we're clustering the stations first and then the qualitative

19:29.560 --> 19:35.400
part comes only in interpreting those clusters. You essentially created a way to

19:35.400 --> 19:43.320
for a regulatory or a government agency or somebody that cares about this to just look at the time

19:43.320 --> 19:50.760
series performance of these stations and their utilization and assess them. Yeah. So yeah exactly.

19:50.760 --> 19:56.680
So the idea behind this is like California plans on installing 100 of these hydrogen stations

19:56.680 --> 20:06.040
in a before 2025 right that's one of the plans to climate change goal plans. So if that's going

20:06.040 --> 20:14.840
to happen we have to make sure people rely on these stations and that is a part of you know building

20:14.840 --> 20:19.240
the reliability because one of the biggest fears like you mentioned earlier like if I have to buy

20:19.240 --> 20:26.120
a hydrogen car it the proximity alone doesn't matter but I need to have a reliable station like if I

20:26.120 --> 20:30.920
go there I need to be able to refuel that's one of the biggest fears behind adopting hydrogen

20:30.920 --> 20:35.320
vehicles and that's the reason behind you know going after electric because you can charge at home.

20:35.320 --> 20:42.360
So I think for you know reducing emissions we need to follow both technologies for diversity and to

20:43.480 --> 20:50.280
adhere to compliance and adhere to follow reliable solutions or you know throw out reliable

20:50.280 --> 20:57.080
solutions to public we need to have these kind of mechanisms in place and this is one of the projects

20:57.080 --> 21:02.120
like I didn't see anything happening in the policy area and so once I wrote the paper I sent it

21:02.120 --> 21:05.960
out to California fields of partnership and they were really interested in seeing this further.

21:05.960 --> 21:11.240
That's awesome. That's awesome. It does track me that once the station is built it's a little bit too

21:11.240 --> 21:17.480
late. Can you envision applying you know either the techniques similar to the ones you've written

21:17.480 --> 21:26.520
about or other machine learning techniques to do this more predictively to for example determine

21:26.520 --> 21:33.800
where the the next 50 to 70 station should go? I think it can happen because the stations are

21:33.800 --> 21:41.320
pretty sparse right now so for example if if Fremont is having more traffic than usual then it

21:41.320 --> 21:46.680
is it would be easy to identify where it's coming from and then you know the next station placement

21:46.680 --> 21:53.160
can be made nearby so that it alleviates that or the station capacity can be increased pretty quickly

21:53.880 --> 22:00.040
that doesn't need a lot of infrastructure cost so it is just a matter of delivering it more

22:00.040 --> 22:05.800
frequently. So yeah so I think those are the low cost solutions that can help in the meantime

22:06.840 --> 22:12.280
to help people adopt more zero emission vehicles. And you mentioned earlier in the conversation

22:12.280 --> 22:17.400
I believe as one of your assumptions a linear relationship between

22:18.680 --> 22:27.960
demand and consumption. Did your paper validate that assumption or did you challenge that assumption

22:27.960 --> 22:33.960
within your research? So I did validate that I ran all the linear regression assumptions within

22:33.960 --> 22:41.240
there but I also mentioned that within the paper since it's a sparse placement of stations maybe

22:41.240 --> 22:47.960
this simple relationship is okay for now but as the add more the relationship might not be linear

22:49.080 --> 22:54.840
so we have to be careful to extend this to future use cases if you know we can't just assume the

22:54.840 --> 23:02.280
same factors will apply when we add more so it is a scalable solution but we need to be careful of

23:02.280 --> 23:09.160
what we are doing. Cool so it sounds like this paper was in a lot of ways a passion project

23:09.160 --> 23:16.520
but also ties into your research at part. Can you talk a little bit about the connection and more

23:16.520 --> 23:23.560
broadly the types of research you're going after at the research center? Yeah so actually I have to

23:23.560 --> 23:28.760
say this is completely my passion project it was not the one that I did at part and you can see why

23:28.760 --> 23:34.760
right because I was getting frustrated with the station usage and such. So at part I have been

23:34.760 --> 23:42.040
working on different kinds of projects so I'm within the machine learning group at part

23:42.840 --> 23:47.880
and there are different kinds of labs you know one for computer vision natural language

23:48.680 --> 23:53.560
you know sensor systems and we have printed electronics they're all part of hardware labs

23:54.920 --> 24:03.080
so my favorite thing about that is I work horizontally across all these labs so I'm able to

24:03.080 --> 24:09.080
pick and work on what I like so some of the interesting projects that I've done so far which

24:09.080 --> 24:16.120
are not related to transportation or energy as I developed a graphic design art generation

24:16.920 --> 24:25.320
using deep learning so we did that for a client who wanted to generate you know these designs fast

24:25.320 --> 24:30.520
on a scalable basis so we had to deploy these deep learning models onto the cloud.

24:30.520 --> 24:36.840
What kind of designs are we talking about? So I published or worked something called intricate

24:37.400 --> 24:44.360
design intricate deep transfer design so it is like a similar to style transfer where we have

24:45.000 --> 24:50.920
a painting and a content where you know the outcome would be a picture that looks like a painting

24:50.920 --> 24:59.800
in this case I'm using a silhouette as a content and any pattern and in the place of design

24:59.800 --> 25:06.920
style and then the outcome would be these patterns divided into new kind of chunks

25:07.720 --> 25:13.320
so that the output looks abstract at the same time it fits the shape of the silhouette.

25:14.360 --> 25:20.680
So if you look up I think there will be one called deep quilted Darth Vader which is one of my

25:20.680 --> 25:29.000
signature words so I gave a quilt design and then Darth Vader's silhouette as a content and then

25:29.000 --> 25:36.120
the output looks you know as if the quilt is stitched at the edges of the Darth Vader as if it's

25:36.120 --> 25:41.640
quilted and it is different from cutting and pasting it because you know if you cut it the

25:41.640 --> 25:48.360
finish won't be nice so we're using this kind of style transfer for that. There are other examples

25:48.360 --> 25:52.840
also like this one more thing I did that has a stained glass effect like if you use a geometric

25:52.840 --> 25:58.440
style it leads to a stained glass effect so I tried with different kinds of patterns and that was

25:58.440 --> 26:05.880
one of my pioneer projects at park so you know you can see like I worked on different kinds of

26:05.880 --> 26:12.920
domains there and I also remember you're also a comic artist so this is also tying into your

26:12.920 --> 26:22.360
passions. Yeah exactly yeah so yeah art is something so the way I say it like two things stick me

26:22.360 --> 26:27.640
it's math and art so this was very cool because I was able to combine two of these things.

26:27.640 --> 26:33.800
You mentioned a client came to you are there commercial applications that you can talk about of

26:33.800 --> 26:44.120
this kind of work? Yeah so the client is a Xerox company so they wanted they are like marketing

26:45.080 --> 26:49.240
designed company so they wanted to see if they can produce personalized designs

26:50.200 --> 26:56.760
depending on the color or graphic types and such so and they really liked it because it was

26:56.760 --> 27:01.160
able to do that those things so if you have a logo you'll be able to generate something

27:01.160 --> 27:09.800
personalized to you that is the idea behind this. Yeah and you also worked with more projects

27:09.800 --> 27:15.720
in the computer vision group on in an augmented reality assistant so I designed an object detection

27:15.720 --> 27:22.520
algorithm for them and also with the dialogue systems in the with the chat group and currently

27:22.520 --> 27:29.560
I'm putting together my research agenda to do the combined work of you know hardware and software

27:29.560 --> 27:34.920
expertise within park so the idea is to create so at hardware labs we produce a lot of sensors

27:35.480 --> 27:41.480
printed electronics and such so I'm exploring to see how we can use those technologies with machine

27:41.480 --> 27:48.040
learning and you know it can be applied in immediate use cases but I'm looking at energy and climate

27:48.040 --> 27:56.040
areas and you have some kind of visibility into or specific ideas into how they apply to energy

27:56.040 --> 28:01.880
and climate that you can share with us. For now we are just exploring things but there could be

28:01.880 --> 28:09.640
any number of use cases right for example agriculture is a big one so if you have so park does

28:09.640 --> 28:18.040
a lot of low cost sensors so it can be combined with machine learning to identify what are the

28:18.040 --> 28:25.720
some crops that can be grown in a specific region or even in a we have a project on carbon

28:25.720 --> 28:30.600
capture so you know we can use all these carbon sensors humidity sensors and temperature sensors

28:30.600 --> 28:36.520
to identify where are the right locations for those and how can we verify that carbon is being

28:36.520 --> 28:43.240
captured and so on so it is still very very new like it's in the ideation phase so I'm still

28:43.240 --> 28:47.560
putting together a lot of things and of course transportation is a big one among them as well

28:48.680 --> 28:55.320
so we are we are trying to see so there is freedom to do set our own to search agenda at park

28:55.320 --> 29:01.880
within reason so that it has you know relevant business use cases too so I'm trying to match those

29:01.880 --> 29:07.400
two together sounds like a fun place to be yeah it's great a lot of smart people

29:09.080 --> 29:14.440
yeah and people some people have been there since the 1970s since park was formed so it's great

29:14.440 --> 29:20.280
to have all their wisdom yeah so it's very nice to be there awesome awesome well collide thanks so
