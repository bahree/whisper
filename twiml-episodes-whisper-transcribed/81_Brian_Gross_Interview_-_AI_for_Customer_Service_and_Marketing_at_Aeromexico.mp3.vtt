00:00.000 --> 00:15.920
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

00:15.920 --> 00:20.880
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.120
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:23.120 --> 00:27.680
This week on the podcast features a series of conversations with speakers from the AI

00:27.680 --> 00:29.520
Summit in New York City.

00:29.520 --> 00:34.800
The theme of that conference and this series is AI in the Enterprise, and I think you'll

00:34.800 --> 00:40.640
find a really interesting mix of both technical and case study oriented discussions this week.

00:40.640 --> 00:46.000
Please note that on Wednesday, December 13th, we'll be holding our last Twimble online

00:46.000 --> 00:47.960
meet-up of the year.

00:47.960 --> 00:53.120
Bring your thoughts on the top machine learning and AI stories of 2017 for our discussion segment,

00:53.120 --> 00:58.440
and for our main presentation, Bruno Gonzales will be discussing the paper, understanding

00:58.440 --> 01:04.600
deep learning requires rethinking generalization by Shi Yuan Zhang from MIT and Google Brain

01:04.600 --> 01:05.920
and others.

01:05.920 --> 01:11.240
You can find more details and register at twimbleai.com slash meet-up.

01:11.240 --> 01:16.440
Today, I'm joined by Brian Gross, head of digital innovation for the Mexico City-based

01:16.440 --> 01:18.240
airline Aero Mexico.

01:18.240 --> 01:23.040
Aero Mexico is using AI techniques like neural nets to build a chatbot that responds to

01:23.040 --> 01:25.160
its customers inquiries.

01:25.160 --> 01:29.920
In our conversation, Brian describes how he views the chatbot landscape, shares his

01:29.920 --> 01:34.360
thoughts on the platform requirements that establish enterprises like Aero Mexico have

01:34.360 --> 01:39.800
for their bots, and describes how Aero Mexico plans to stay ahead of the curve.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.680
Be sure to post any feedback or questions you may have to the show notes page, which

01:43.680 --> 01:49.040
you'll find at twimbleai.com slash talk slash 79.

01:49.040 --> 01:54.480

02:34.680 --> 02:36.720
And now on to the show.

02:36.720 --> 02:49.320
All right, everyone, I am here on the line with Brian Gross, who is Vice President of

02:49.320 --> 02:52.240
Digital Innovation at Aero Mexico.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.840
Brian, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

02:54.840 --> 02:57.480
Hey, thanks for inviting me to your podcast.

02:57.480 --> 02:58.480
Absolutely.

02:58.480 --> 03:05.240
I'm looking forward to chatting with you about what you're doing at Aero Mexico with AI.

03:05.240 --> 03:09.160
Why don't we get started by having you tell us a little bit about your background, how

03:09.160 --> 03:13.320
you got interested in artificial intelligence, and how you're using it at Aero Mexico?

03:13.320 --> 03:19.400
Yeah, so my background has always been in delivery channels, even before the internet.

03:19.400 --> 03:24.360
So back in banking, we had electronic banking, then we did the studies for internet banking.

03:24.360 --> 03:28.600
So we're talking the late 90s here, giving away my age a little bit, but at delivering

03:28.600 --> 03:32.160
services over the web, right, with that was starting.

03:32.160 --> 03:38.440
Then I was at AT&T back in the 2010 around then, doing consumer cloud services.

03:38.440 --> 03:43.480
So we were developing more things like music storage and photo storage in the cloud.

03:43.480 --> 03:47.800
And those products, well, honestly, it didn't really take off, but it was an interesting

03:47.800 --> 03:51.400
exploration of the cloud right at the beginning there.

03:51.400 --> 03:56.200
And then about four years ago, through various contacts, I came to do a consulting study here

03:56.200 --> 03:58.200
at Aero Mexico in Mexico City.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.200
I am.

03:59.200 --> 04:03.320
So I am from the United States, but I've been down here in Mexico City for four years.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.480
And it's a very interesting company.

04:05.480 --> 04:09.040
It was stayed on for almost three decades.

04:09.040 --> 04:13.200
And there was a lot of interest in modernizing the company on all fronts.

04:13.200 --> 04:19.080
So they had a bunch of new blood come in in 2013, 2014.

04:19.080 --> 04:22.240
And I came here and did an analysis of what needed to be done.

04:22.240 --> 04:27.960
So from there, we did, they asked me to stay on and do a complete digital transformation.

04:27.960 --> 04:33.720
So we did a new website, new app, new key asking all of that was had an API underlying

04:33.720 --> 04:34.720
it.

04:34.720 --> 04:39.320
So all the business logic of the airline, like flights, prices, check in and stuff like

04:39.320 --> 04:40.320
that.

04:40.320 --> 04:44.920
So the first time uniform across all these different delivery channels, whereas previously

04:44.920 --> 04:46.920
they were they were separate black boxes.

04:46.920 --> 04:52.680
So this is a huge impact and you're talking about an environment which is very far behind

04:52.680 --> 04:56.840
a place like the United States or Western Europe in terms of digitalization, you know, people

04:56.840 --> 04:58.680
purchasing their tickets online.

04:58.680 --> 05:04.760
So we went from about one quarter of, let's say that we call that the penetration rate.

05:04.760 --> 05:08.720
So how many people buy their tickets on our direct website went from about one quarter

05:08.720 --> 05:12.960
what you would typically see in the US to about, now we're about one half of that of

05:12.960 --> 05:13.960
that index.

05:13.960 --> 05:17.320
So we've made tremendous progress over those years.

05:17.320 --> 05:23.040
And then once that set of products was mature back in the beginning of 2017, my boss asked

05:23.040 --> 05:28.120
me to start an innovation area and said, look, you know, the definition is completely open.

05:28.120 --> 05:31.960
So we have a bunch of initiatives in parallel, but one of the ones that we started focusing

05:31.960 --> 05:34.360
on was messaging platforms.

05:34.360 --> 05:39.160
So Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, which is really big, you know, most parts of the world outside

05:39.160 --> 05:40.160
the US.

05:40.160 --> 05:44.880
Yeah, but I mean here in Mexico, WhatsApp is absolutely everything you use it to talk

05:44.880 --> 05:49.120
to your friends, your family, professionals, whatever you're constantly on, on WhatsApp,

05:49.120 --> 05:51.000
Facebook Messenger is also there.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.800
And these platforms were starting to open up for, you know, more famously chatbots, but

05:56.800 --> 06:01.840
I think more broadly and more importantly, delivering customer service and to some extent

06:01.840 --> 06:04.640
it sails, you know, over those channels.

06:04.640 --> 06:09.160
So we really started focusing on that, and that's the origin of the presentation, the

06:09.160 --> 06:11.080
story that I'm going to share.

06:11.080 --> 06:16.000
And you mentioned the presentation this week connected around a presentation that you're

06:16.000 --> 06:19.240
going to be doing at the AI summit.

06:19.240 --> 06:26.440
I'm curious when you think about chatbots and using them for customer service, are there

06:26.440 --> 06:30.720
any companies that you think, who's your role model in this space?

06:30.720 --> 06:32.360
Who's doing it really, really well?

06:32.360 --> 06:34.640
Well, I think all of this is really, really new.

06:34.640 --> 06:40.560
I mean, Facebook only came out with the chatbot platform for Messenger back in April of

06:40.560 --> 06:42.280
2016.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.160
So people are so exploring.

06:44.160 --> 06:46.600
There is no real best practice.

06:46.600 --> 06:50.960
If we look, we're lucky, though, because in the airline world, there is KLM out there

06:50.960 --> 06:55.400
who's very innovative on many different things, and this is one of them.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.080
So they were the first ones to come out with an airline chatbot.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.840
So we kind of looked at what was going on with them.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.880
But if you look at the vendor space, it's still a real niche match.

07:03.880 --> 07:07.480
You have some of the big players like IBM, with Watson, and so forth.

07:07.480 --> 07:12.080
You have a lot now of the big digital agencies and consulting companies that will tell you

07:12.080 --> 07:15.760
that they can deliver this, but there's no mature robust model.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.560
I mean, we have ours, and we're really happy with what we've developed.

07:19.560 --> 07:23.960
But we're working with a local startup here in Mexico City called Yellow Chat, and they're

07:23.960 --> 07:24.960
just really brilliant.

07:24.960 --> 07:30.880
So I think together we've developed an ecosystem around messaging that includes AI that's

07:30.880 --> 07:34.120
really set to do amazing things in customer service.

07:34.120 --> 07:40.520
When you think about this ecosystem and AI, what are the other things that you're doing

07:40.520 --> 07:48.800
beyond the chatbot that you put in the AI bucket, or to what extent are you, well, I guess

07:48.800 --> 07:50.600
I don't want to throw in too many questions at once.

07:50.600 --> 07:54.880
Why don't we start with the full breadth of what you're doing under the AI banner?

07:54.880 --> 07:55.880
Yeah.

07:55.880 --> 07:56.880
Exactly.

07:56.880 --> 07:57.880
Good question.

07:57.880 --> 08:03.360
So talking about this ecosystem or platform around messaging, there's maybe half a dozen

08:03.360 --> 08:08.080
elements to that, and the chatbot is really only one, because after all, chat has existed

08:08.080 --> 08:14.080
for, I don't know how long, probably a decade or longer, right, on, there's web chat.

08:14.080 --> 08:19.960
We have on our site still, we have this web-based chat that is just, it's just an interface

08:19.960 --> 08:22.800
for sending a message back and forth to an agent.

08:22.800 --> 08:25.760
So nothing AI about that in the least.

08:25.760 --> 08:31.320
So it's just saying chatbot doesn't make it AI, but you have the chatbot interface.

08:31.320 --> 08:36.760
You have the neural network, which is really where the AI comes into play, and this is trained,

08:36.760 --> 08:41.800
so we trained ours on four months' worth of chat and Twitter data, which allows a customer

08:41.800 --> 08:45.640
to ask any kind of question, you know, they can phrase it any way they want.

08:45.640 --> 08:50.240
And then the system is smart enough to pull out the intent from that question, and then

08:50.240 --> 08:54.880
match it with one of hundreds of answers that pretty much is in, you know, like a database

08:54.880 --> 08:55.880
type list.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.000
So that's another important element.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.560
Taking it back a step and looking at it at a higher level, what services are we providing

09:01.560 --> 09:02.560
on there?

09:02.560 --> 09:07.120
So when you go into our chatbot or our messaging interface, I should say, it's actually

09:07.120 --> 09:09.480
going to guide you based on intent down one of three paths.

09:09.480 --> 09:15.240
So one is, yes, you can ask that open question, and the AI will pull back one of hundreds

09:15.240 --> 09:18.320
of answers and help you along your way, right?

09:18.320 --> 09:22.000
And we don't pretend that this is, you know, super future.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.680
I mean, this is, it is where it is right now, and that means that we can give you hundreds

09:25.680 --> 09:28.200
of good, but simple answers, right?

09:28.200 --> 09:30.800
And then complicated is definitely going to a human agent.

09:30.800 --> 09:34.080
So then we have option number two, which is human agent.

09:34.080 --> 09:38.640
So that will be if we can't answer your questions from the neural network, or simply if you type

09:38.640 --> 09:42.000
in the word help, it will give you the human agent.

09:42.000 --> 09:48.000
And then the third one is, if we detect that you want to do a certain task, we have predefined

09:48.000 --> 09:53.520
tasks like search for flight, track the status of a flight, you know, is it on time or whatever.

09:53.520 --> 09:57.920
We have recommendations for hotels and sightseeing in our destinations.

09:57.920 --> 10:02.480
We have notifications so you can get push notifications about the status of a flight, and

10:02.480 --> 10:03.800
we have a couple other things.

10:03.800 --> 10:08.600
So then you go down this kind of predefined path where you're not asking open questions.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.000
It's just very much pre-programmed.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.440
And that kind of chatbot interaction has also existed for some time.

10:13.440 --> 10:17.560
So we're in this mixed space, and then there's also a trick of, you know, making that work

10:17.560 --> 10:18.560
together, right?

10:18.560 --> 10:23.720
So if you're passing it off to the human, the human, you know, takes the session quickly,

10:23.720 --> 10:28.120
attends to it, puts them back in the default mode, which will send it to the chatbot again,

10:28.120 --> 10:33.040
you know, those kind of tasks are also important to sketch out and implement.

10:33.040 --> 10:38.400
Can you talk a little bit about what some of your goals as a business are in going down

10:38.400 --> 10:39.400
this path?

10:39.400 --> 10:44.880
Is it, you talked a little bit about for your website, kind of driving consumers to book

10:44.880 --> 10:50.400
tickets there, and as a bit of a travel geek, I know that there are, you know, one of the

10:50.400 --> 10:52.960
drivers for airlines in doing that.

10:52.960 --> 10:58.360
So in doing those types of things is to reduce commissions that they pay out to third parties.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.840
Are there similar motivations here?

11:00.840 --> 11:03.920
Is it, you know, based on quality of service?

11:03.920 --> 11:05.240
What are you hoping to achieve?

11:05.240 --> 11:06.240
Yeah.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.240
So that's really changed a lot.

11:08.240 --> 11:13.840
We have the luxury of having this innovation area that I had up, and they give me a bit

11:13.840 --> 11:15.160
of latitude.

11:15.160 --> 11:20.720
So I don't have to go after hard and fast business goal with some of this emerging technology.

11:20.720 --> 11:24.600
So back in 2016, in April, when Facebook came out, everybody was saying, oh, this is

11:24.600 --> 11:27.000
great for booking tickets sell, sell, sell.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.920
So you know, we had that life for a year, and we were just seeing that no one was buying

11:31.920 --> 11:32.920
tickets.

11:32.920 --> 11:37.560
I mean, you know, I don't want to say the number, but it's very low actual number of tickets.

11:37.560 --> 11:43.240
But a lot of shopping, a lot of questions, but we really saw those questions take off.

11:43.240 --> 11:48.200
People loved it when we had infigues, and then we added the neural network that was around.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.400
That was in the spring of this year.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.480
So when we added the neural network, you know, we saw that take off.

11:52.480 --> 11:57.560
So we saw that people wanted to use this channel for customer service, and it made sense.

11:57.560 --> 12:01.400
Now, looking back with 2020 vision, you could say, yeah, yeah, you could have figured that

12:01.400 --> 12:06.120
out a long, but I mean, realistically, we weren't experts in this, you know, so we saw

12:06.120 --> 12:11.280
that customer service is really the killer user case for this, and also people shopping

12:11.280 --> 12:12.280
for tickets.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.920
It's perfectly fine with me if people want to shop for tickets on the chat, and then we

12:15.920 --> 12:18.080
direct them to the website.

12:18.080 --> 12:22.240
We're also in a market where a lot of people want to be attended to personally.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.880
It's a very different culture from the United States.

12:24.880 --> 12:30.040
You have people that simply are, they don't have 10 years of history of using Amazon and

12:30.040 --> 12:31.760
eBay and all this stuff.

12:31.760 --> 12:32.920
It's not in the culture.

12:32.920 --> 12:37.200
So if you want us to transfer, you know, if they want us to transfer them over to a human

12:37.200 --> 12:40.240
agent, I'm perfectly happy with that too.

12:40.240 --> 12:44.400
Also direct sale for us, no commissions, you know, et cetera, and that's what we're working

12:44.400 --> 12:45.400
on as well.

12:45.400 --> 12:49.800
So we want to extend this platform to our call center personnel who will start picking

12:49.800 --> 12:55.080
up the chat, adding a payment solution so that people can pay safely on their smartphones

12:55.080 --> 12:58.760
while they're chatting to the agent, the agent won't ever see their data or anything

12:58.760 --> 12:59.760
like that.

12:59.760 --> 13:07.080
So, yeah, it's a lot of different functions that work on the channel, but it is not actually

13:07.080 --> 13:10.440
booking a ticket right with the chatbot.

13:10.440 --> 13:12.400
It's also everything but that.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.400
Okay.

13:13.400 --> 13:22.160
I think if I'm correct, the airlines have a term for the number of people that are shopping

13:22.160 --> 13:26.280
versus actually buying tickets, I think it's the book ratio.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.280
Yeah, correct.

13:27.280 --> 13:34.040
And so it's typically what you found in looking at the chatbot is pretty typical for other

13:34.040 --> 13:37.200
types of booking experiences as well, right?

13:37.200 --> 13:42.680
The number of tickets relative to the number of tire kickers, if you will, is pretty low.

13:42.680 --> 13:43.680
Is that right?

13:43.680 --> 13:45.040
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

13:45.040 --> 13:46.680
And that's what's happening on mobile anyway.

13:46.680 --> 13:50.720
So even when you have an awesome mobile website, that was actually the first thing that we

13:50.720 --> 13:54.960
did when we redid the website was we said it had to be responsive and the mobile experience

13:54.960 --> 13:57.600
has to be as good as the desktop experience.

13:57.600 --> 14:04.720
But even then we're seeing around 10% of our direct digital sales coming from cell phones,

14:04.720 --> 14:07.800
even though the traffic is approaching 50%, right?

14:07.800 --> 14:11.080
And for what I know from the US market, that's also typical.

14:11.080 --> 14:16.680
Now the stats that you can actually get out in public are mostly about hotels or they

14:16.680 --> 14:18.400
come from China, right?

14:18.400 --> 14:23.160
So you're starting to see things like 30% of flight bookings in China, supposedly, are

14:23.160 --> 14:26.440
coming from mobile, you know, most of the hotel bookings.

14:26.440 --> 14:29.000
But in North America, we're still in the tens.

14:29.000 --> 14:33.040
I'm kind of okay with that as long as we don't lose the customer.

14:33.040 --> 14:37.600
The problem is the customer that shops on the mobile and then doesn't come back to us

14:37.600 --> 14:38.760
when they come to the desktop.

14:38.760 --> 14:42.320
So that's why we do want to keep trying to capture that payment.

14:42.320 --> 14:46.160
You know, mobile website is another story, but here on the chatbot, that's why bringing

14:46.160 --> 14:52.000
in the human agents who can close the sale, then there's a safe, secure payment method

14:52.000 --> 14:54.040
and convenient on your cell phone.

14:54.040 --> 14:57.560
So we can close that sale out and make sure we get that sale and not an online travel

14:57.560 --> 14:58.560
agency.

14:58.560 --> 14:59.560
Right.

14:59.560 --> 15:04.240
You mentioned that you're, and I forget the metric that you said, whether it was usage

15:04.240 --> 15:10.160
or, or kind of the experience, increase significantly when you brought the neural network

15:10.160 --> 15:11.160
online.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.160
Can you elaborate on that?

15:12.160 --> 15:17.760
What exactly was it about bringing on your own models that you train that, you know,

15:17.760 --> 15:22.720
fundamentally changed the way people use the messaging experience?

15:22.720 --> 15:23.720
Yeah.

15:23.720 --> 15:29.760
When we first rolled out the chatbot in September 2016, we only had an FAQ section.

15:29.760 --> 15:35.480
So it was limited to certain topics, yeah, like luggage and where do you fly and things

15:35.480 --> 15:36.480
like that.

15:36.480 --> 15:40.480
So it was very static and the chances that we would actually address the question that

15:40.480 --> 15:43.880
you had were relatively small.

15:43.880 --> 15:48.360
And now you can literally come into the chatbot and ask anything and we'll give you access

15:48.360 --> 15:51.360
to hundreds and hundreds of, you know, basically any information we would provide over the

15:51.360 --> 15:54.880
web and then some is available in the answers.

15:54.880 --> 15:55.880
Okay.

15:55.880 --> 16:02.880
One of the, I've talked to a number of companies that are either on the provider side

16:02.880 --> 16:07.320
of chatbots or the customer side, such as yourself.

16:07.320 --> 16:14.240
And, you know, there are a number of commercial chatbot platforms out there.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.520
Are you using one of those?

16:15.520 --> 16:20.080
It sounds like you're not that you've got something that was developed from scratch by this

16:20.080 --> 16:26.640
startup or yeah, I think that the market is still developing in that sense.

16:26.640 --> 16:32.760
So if you're looking at the needs of a large corporate customer like an airline, I have

16:32.760 --> 16:37.360
not seen anybody out there that has a complete solution that has all of these elements.

16:37.360 --> 16:43.480
So again, that's the chatbot, the AI, neural network, the human agents, the front end for

16:43.480 --> 16:48.240
the human agents, the backend integration into your sales force or your other CRM.

16:48.240 --> 16:52.960
So all of these elements together, nobody actually delivers that in a package right now that

16:52.960 --> 16:53.960
I am aware of.

16:53.960 --> 16:57.240
Now, someone can contact me and correct me, but we've done a lot of market research into

16:57.240 --> 16:58.240
this.

16:58.240 --> 17:01.280
And there's hundreds of chatbot providers that can provide you a chatbot.

17:01.280 --> 17:04.360
And when we started looking into even some of the best of these, some of the real big

17:04.360 --> 17:08.000
names that I don't think I should name on a podcast, but some of these names that have

17:08.000 --> 17:13.080
been around for many years are still literally selling you just the interface for someone

17:13.080 --> 17:15.800
to chat to a human agent, right?

17:15.800 --> 17:21.720
And I just think, I think that's, I just would never start a project like that in 2017,

17:21.720 --> 17:25.600
because, you know, where's your plan to have all those other elements I'm talking about?

17:25.600 --> 17:29.080
It's finding dandy to have human agents, you need that, but you need all those other

17:29.080 --> 17:30.960
elements in there.

17:30.960 --> 17:35.280
So a couple of those big names, both global and regional, either provided that or there

17:35.280 --> 17:41.120
was another one regional here in Latin America that had table-driven questions and answers.

17:41.120 --> 17:45.480
So instead of AI and a neural network, you would actually type in the questions and answers

17:45.480 --> 17:46.480
yourself.

17:46.480 --> 17:51.160
And then they would help you out by adding some grammatical variations and verb conjugations

17:51.160 --> 17:54.200
and stuff like that, but basically it was table-driven.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.600
So you're also talking about an old technology.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.720
And then you get, you know, other people coming to visit you and they've got elements, right?

17:59.720 --> 18:04.600
They've got AI platforms, but they don't have all the other elements and integrations

18:04.600 --> 18:05.600
built out.

18:05.600 --> 18:09.000
And they'll gladly charge you hundreds of thousands of dollars to do that.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.440
So I think it's a huge opportunity, particularly for a startup.

18:12.440 --> 18:17.240
I think for this one here in Mexico, yellow chat, but also, you know, other ones around

18:17.240 --> 18:22.560
the world to come with a full package, you know, if you come to someone like me and a corporate,

18:22.560 --> 18:24.200
they don't necessarily know that they need this all.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.120
We've discovered this and built this over a year.

18:26.120 --> 18:31.440
So I think this is something you can take, kind of copy paste that whole modular concept

18:31.440 --> 18:32.880
and start selling it out to corporate.

18:32.880 --> 18:37.120
So I'm sure we'll start seeing that in the next year or two, you know, just like you

18:37.120 --> 18:39.920
have companies that do that for e-commerce for you.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.440
You'll have that for messaging.

18:41.440 --> 18:42.440
All right.

18:42.440 --> 18:43.440
All right.

18:43.440 --> 18:49.000
Do you know if they're using any off-to-shelf pieces on the AI side of things?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.000
Yeah.

18:50.000 --> 18:56.440
So no, we actually built the neural network custom because the idea was, well, we built

18:56.440 --> 19:01.680
a company out of L.A. called IV.ai, I want to give them credit because that worked out

19:01.680 --> 19:03.360
also very well for us.

19:03.360 --> 19:07.640
The reason that a tailored approach was chosen wasn't particular.

19:07.640 --> 19:08.960
The type of content, right?

19:08.960 --> 19:13.360
So this is not only Spanish, it's not only the variety of Spanish that's spoken in Mexico.

19:13.360 --> 19:17.280
It's the way that people express themselves when they're asking questions relating to our

19:17.280 --> 19:18.520
services.

19:18.520 --> 19:19.520
And that varies.

19:19.520 --> 19:25.280
That's so different from even other verticals within Mexico that you have to have historical

19:25.280 --> 19:26.280
data.

19:26.280 --> 19:29.920
So this was done on a custom basis.

19:29.920 --> 19:37.640
And did you evaluate platforms like API.ai and others and found that they couldn't handle

19:37.640 --> 19:39.640
those particular issues for you?

19:39.640 --> 19:41.240
Well, not me personally know.

19:41.240 --> 19:45.160
So I depend on yellow chat for that.

19:45.160 --> 19:49.000
And this is what they told me, you know, this was a bit what they told me about their internal

19:49.000 --> 19:51.840
decision making, but we relied on them for that choice.

19:51.840 --> 19:52.840
Got it.

19:52.840 --> 19:53.840
All right.

19:53.840 --> 19:54.840
Great.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.240
And then where do you see AI going at, era, Mexico?

19:58.240 --> 20:01.240
It's actually the main focus of our innovation area.

20:01.240 --> 20:06.040
So I shouldn't mention the innovation area I'm in is within the commercial and customer service

20:06.040 --> 20:07.040
area.

20:07.040 --> 20:11.640
So not really in the operations, I'm not looking so much at how people, I don't know,

20:11.640 --> 20:14.640
you know, pass through security gates or things like that.

20:14.640 --> 20:20.240
I'm looking a lot at distribution and customer service solutions and AI has the ability to

20:20.240 --> 20:25.040
help us automate but optimize more than anything a lot of different areas.

20:25.040 --> 20:29.480
So one completely different application would be in our marketing area, right?

20:29.480 --> 20:30.640
We have the ability now.

20:30.640 --> 20:35.800
We have all the tools in place to send people an absolutely individual email.

20:35.800 --> 20:40.520
You know, for millions of millions of people getting a different email, but there's actually,

20:40.520 --> 20:45.200
you know, a lot of people will say they have this, but no one can actually help you construct

20:45.200 --> 20:46.200
that email.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.200
Okay.

20:47.200 --> 20:49.360
We have all this all this data about you in our CRM.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.160
We know all your personal data.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.400
We can segment you.

20:52.400 --> 20:53.800
We can guess at your income.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.000
We know your geographical location.

20:56.000 --> 20:59.000
We know what you've bought from us before or haven't bought from us.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.000
All right.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.240
And we also have stuff product that we need to push, right?

21:02.240 --> 21:04.480
We have routes where there's a lot of seats available.

21:04.480 --> 21:08.000
So how do you combine all that into millions of different emails?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.720
So no one has a way to do that.

21:09.720 --> 21:14.720
So really, now that's not necessarily AI to compose the email that, but you need some

21:14.720 --> 21:16.560
powerful machines to do that.

21:16.560 --> 21:21.920
But then you execute the campaign, you analyze it, and then you go ahead and you do better

21:21.920 --> 21:23.080
the next time around.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.040
Now that is machine learning, right?

21:25.040 --> 21:28.200
And I think only machine learning can bring us to that scale.

21:28.200 --> 21:35.200
So imagine the power of email marketing where the response rate is four or five times or

21:35.200 --> 21:39.480
maybe even ten times what you had before in these generic things.

21:39.480 --> 21:40.640
And it's not just email.

21:40.640 --> 21:45.160
We also have the ability to do a different website for each individual with a tool called

21:45.160 --> 21:46.480
optimizely.

21:46.480 --> 21:50.560
We have our digital marketing where we put out our ads.

21:50.560 --> 21:56.080
Now those are already highly tailored because the ad vendors provide a lot of tools to segment

21:56.080 --> 22:02.720
target markets and even individuals, but having the CRM data directly feed into what we

22:02.720 --> 22:06.720
request from those advertisers makes it still much more powerful.

22:06.720 --> 22:13.320
So that's another area, but we can go on, basically harnessing all this fast data, big

22:13.320 --> 22:16.560
data, which is such a buzzword, right?

22:16.560 --> 22:18.240
But how do you actually do that?

22:18.240 --> 22:20.960
So that's another area of focus.

22:20.960 --> 22:29.360
Do you see this happening via a portfolio of essentially independent projects, or do

22:29.360 --> 22:37.560
you see the evolution of a platform that provides some core sets of AI services that these

22:37.560 --> 22:44.720
different teams can use to build AI into the things that they do, like the email marketing,

22:44.720 --> 22:45.720
customer service, et cetera?

22:45.720 --> 22:50.920
That's a really thought-provoking question because I'll tell you the one company that

22:50.920 --> 22:54.720
has made their presence known in a big way is Google, right?

22:54.720 --> 23:00.000
They have this big data platform and data crunching where you can pay as you go.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.920
It's a very attractive option that everybody immediately got excited about.

23:03.920 --> 23:07.240
And I'm sure there's actually competitors out there that have similar products.

23:07.240 --> 23:11.680
Honestly, we haven't looked into that into the competitors and a lot of depth.

23:11.680 --> 23:15.480
So definitely a platform will be there, but what's definitely missing is the strategic

23:15.480 --> 23:16.480
direction, right?

23:16.480 --> 23:21.880
A company like, we don't want to pay millions to some major consulting company to give

23:21.880 --> 23:22.880
us direction.

23:22.880 --> 23:23.880
That doesn't make sense.

23:23.880 --> 23:28.320
I mean, there should be, I think we're going to coalesce around common sense directions

23:28.320 --> 23:33.680
that big companies have to go in when it comes to an AI strategy.

23:33.680 --> 23:35.280
But I don't think we're there yet.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.280
Not at all.

23:36.280 --> 23:37.280
I haven't seen that.

23:37.280 --> 23:42.200
So I think for the moment, we're still in the phase of investigating in a very individual

23:42.200 --> 23:48.280
way, the problems that we want to solve, so that that's not knowledge that is prepackaged

23:48.280 --> 23:49.520
or readily accessible.

23:49.520 --> 23:53.640
And I think that's why we'll see a lot of individual projects, even though we might

23:53.640 --> 24:00.480
all be on the same sort of big data platform as a tool.

24:00.480 --> 24:07.680
Those types of platforms can be vendor delivered or can be an internal platform that develops

24:07.680 --> 24:12.600
at Aero, Mexico, kind of for its own specific use cases.

24:12.600 --> 24:20.160
It sounds like you're still at the stage where you're identifying use cases to experiment

24:20.160 --> 24:23.640
with and use them as learning opportunities.

24:23.640 --> 24:24.920
Is that a fair assessment?

24:24.920 --> 24:25.920
Yeah.

24:25.920 --> 24:26.920
That sounds about accurate.

24:26.920 --> 24:27.920
Yeah.

24:27.920 --> 24:32.320
Also, keep in mind that we're about one tenth the size of large US airlines, right?

24:32.320 --> 24:38.560
The digital were about 50% of the penetration that they have in terms of online sales.

24:38.560 --> 24:43.120
So our budgets and our staffs are conventionally smaller.

24:43.120 --> 24:49.760
So normally we would be looking for solutions to kind of thought to coalesce in the US,

24:49.760 --> 24:54.200
start to be implemented, and then that stuff comes trickling down to Mexico.

24:54.200 --> 24:57.880
But the fact that we are pushing ahead on these individual products starts to give us

24:57.880 --> 25:03.480
a vision of maybe we're ahead of the game, certainly in Mexico, as to where that vision

25:03.480 --> 25:10.080
is going to go around platform and strategy for AI as a layer that goes across the business.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.680
That's a really good point.

25:11.680 --> 25:12.680
Yeah.

25:12.680 --> 25:18.000
And I think that's characteristic of companies, many, many companies in the US as well.

25:18.000 --> 25:20.120
You mentioned an AI strategy.

25:20.120 --> 25:25.920
Is that something that do you have an articulated AI strategy at this time at Aero, Mexico?

25:25.920 --> 25:30.800
No, I think you're catching us in the phase where we're starting to look at where can

25:30.800 --> 25:33.120
we apply this across the different things.

25:33.120 --> 25:38.320
So I gave you a marketing example, but we're right in the middle of starting to sketch,

25:38.320 --> 25:45.360
looking at customer service, customer experience, which is your whole end-to-end travel experience,

25:45.360 --> 25:47.560
marketing, what else do we have here?

25:47.560 --> 25:52.880
So basically everything in the commercial sales, of course, how we deal with our agency

25:52.880 --> 25:58.080
customers, how we deal with our online travel agencies, how we deal with distribution

25:58.080 --> 26:00.040
in general, metastures and stuff like that.

26:00.040 --> 26:04.600
So there's opportunities there, I think, to optimize processes and do new things with

26:04.600 --> 26:05.600
AI.

26:05.600 --> 26:09.960
And we're starting to look at all those and make an inventory and see where we can get

26:09.960 --> 26:12.960
the most bank for the buck in our next few projects.

26:12.960 --> 26:13.960
Awesome.

26:13.960 --> 26:14.960
Awesome.

26:14.960 --> 26:20.680
And I imagine this feels a little bit like when folks are starting to grapple with mobile

26:20.680 --> 26:25.160
and trying to figure out how that all is going to impact things and what's the right

26:25.160 --> 26:28.840
place to start and what are the right tools and technologies.

26:28.840 --> 26:37.720
Are there any lessons that you bring from previous waves of innovation to the way you're

26:37.720 --> 26:39.600
tackling AI?

26:39.600 --> 26:41.400
I think that's a really good analogy.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.640
I haven't thought of that.

26:42.640 --> 26:46.760
Remembering back a few years, I was very frustrated that you would read even sometimes

26:46.760 --> 26:53.560
in very reputable, made-line publications, stuff that just confused all the different aspects

26:53.560 --> 26:54.560
of mobile.

26:54.560 --> 26:55.560
Right?

26:55.560 --> 26:56.560
Right?

26:56.560 --> 26:57.560
What's mobile?

26:57.560 --> 26:58.560
So mobile payments.

26:58.560 --> 27:03.280
Does that mean when you're buying something on a mobile website or does it mean when you're

27:03.280 --> 27:08.640
tapping your phone someplace and you get all these people that would mix that all up together

27:08.640 --> 27:12.960
and misuse that in fact to sell services and consulting?

27:12.960 --> 27:14.280
So I think this is the same thing.

27:14.280 --> 27:19.400
You've got to have an expert within the organization, in this case, that's me who's filtering through

27:19.400 --> 27:23.520
all the noise and saying, okay, what is it that this really does?

27:23.520 --> 27:28.920
So we've determined that this is really about optimizing, well, in the case of things like

27:28.920 --> 27:35.800
marketing, it's about optimizing outputs, optimizing execution of processes as well as some

27:35.800 --> 27:36.800
other things.

27:36.800 --> 27:40.760
But knowing those things very clearly and what you're trying to achieve with that and not

27:40.760 --> 27:46.760
just taking a technology and trying to find a solution, what do you call a solution in

27:46.760 --> 27:47.760
search of a problem?

27:47.760 --> 27:48.760
Right.

27:48.760 --> 27:49.760
Exactly.

27:49.760 --> 27:50.760
And in some sense, we did that.

27:50.760 --> 27:54.800
Like when chatbots first came out, we just got on board and started playing around, you

27:54.800 --> 27:59.160
know, for a few tens of thousands of dollars, basically, we were able to experiment and

27:59.160 --> 28:04.320
that's valuable experience and everybody should try and have that innovation area that's

28:04.320 --> 28:09.000
able to do that because that helps you sort out like what's really going on, right?

28:09.000 --> 28:10.200
What is this really for?

28:10.200 --> 28:13.440
But in parallel, yeah, building up a strategy where you're like, okay, what do I want to

28:13.440 --> 28:14.440
achieve with this?

28:14.440 --> 28:15.440
Right.

28:15.440 --> 28:16.440
Awesome.

28:16.440 --> 28:19.720
Well, Brian, I really appreciate you taking the time.

28:19.720 --> 28:22.720
Is there anything else that you'd like to leave the audience with?

28:22.720 --> 28:26.000
No, I think you hit upon a lot of the main points.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.000
It's really good.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.680
I just think this is an exciting time to be in AI.

28:29.680 --> 28:31.880
There's a lot of discovery going on.

28:31.880 --> 28:36.560
You know, we're in the process of, you know, these solutions like coalescing into kind

28:36.560 --> 28:40.120
of a common sense across companies like this is what we need to do, right?

28:40.120 --> 28:45.760
These are all the elements that go into a messaging, a chat, and AI platforms.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.880
So it's great to be part of that.

28:47.880 --> 28:51.520
And, you know, I think the audience, the conferences are all going to be having different roles

28:51.520 --> 28:52.520
in that.

28:52.520 --> 28:55.480
And I'm also looking forward to learning from all the other presentations, the conference

28:55.480 --> 29:00.480
and all the other applications of AI and business that we can hopefully apply some of those

29:00.480 --> 29:01.720
here at the airline.

29:01.720 --> 29:02.720
Mm-hmm.

29:02.720 --> 29:03.720
Fantastic.

29:03.720 --> 29:04.720
Well, thanks, Brian.

29:04.720 --> 29:05.720
It was great chatting with you.

29:05.720 --> 29:06.720
I appreciate it.

29:06.720 --> 29:07.720
All right.
