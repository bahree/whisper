Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

00:16.320 --> 00:21.480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:21.480 --> 00:31.280
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:31.280 --> 00:36.960
This week on the pod we are excited to present our AI and sports series, perhaps especially

00:36.960 --> 00:42.520
apropos given that much of the globe is glued to the world cup at the moment.

00:42.520 --> 00:48.320
While I'm not personally the biggest sports fan, my producer Amari is a huge sports follower

00:48.320 --> 00:51.600
and this series has been something he's wanted to see for a while now.

00:51.600 --> 00:57.680
So if you like these shows, be sure to send them a shout out on Twitter at at Twimble underscore

00:57.680 --> 01:01.040
Amari, I am ARI.

01:01.040 --> 01:05.720
In this episode of the series, I'm joined by Jennifer Hobbs, senior data scientist at

01:05.720 --> 01:11.560
Stats, a collector and distributor of sports data, covering sports like basketball, soccer,

01:11.560 --> 01:14.280
American football and rugby.

01:14.280 --> 01:18.600
Jennifer and I explore the stats data pipeline and how they collect and store different types

01:18.600 --> 01:22.440
of data for easy consumption and application.

01:22.440 --> 01:27.680
We dig into the paper she co-authored, Mythbusting set pieces in soccer, which takes a look

01:27.680 --> 01:32.560
at the data surrounding free kicks and corner kicks in soccer and an effort to debunk

01:32.560 --> 01:36.440
some longstanding myths around various situations.

01:36.440 --> 01:40.440
If you're using machine learning to try to predict world cup winners, you'll definitely

01:40.440 --> 01:42.040
want to check out this segment.

01:42.040 --> 01:47.120
Finally, Jennifer and I chat about potential projects and applications of machine learning

01:47.120 --> 01:52.760
to sports and the accessibility of sports specific data sets to hobbyists.

01:52.760 --> 01:57.000
Alright, let's do it.

01:57.000 --> 02:04.240
Alright everyone, I am on the line with Jennifer Hobbs, Jennifer is a senior data scientist

02:04.240 --> 02:05.240
with Stats.

02:05.240 --> 02:08.480
Jennifer, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

02:08.480 --> 02:10.200
Great, thanks for having me.

02:10.200 --> 02:14.680
Awesome, so you got your PhD in physics and astronomy.

02:14.680 --> 02:19.600
How did you make your way to data science and just as interestingly, how did you make

02:19.600 --> 02:22.320
your way into sports data science?

02:22.320 --> 02:28.600
Sure, so my background is starting from undergraduate, I was at Northwestern, I was in the Integrated

02:28.600 --> 02:34.400
Science program and also study math and physics, actually originally started out in neutrino

02:34.400 --> 02:39.760
physics and did research at Fermi lab for several years, starting when I was in undergraduate

02:39.760 --> 02:42.640
and then continuing into my PhD.

02:42.640 --> 02:47.280
And about maybe during my first or second year of my PhD, I realized that that's not quite

02:47.280 --> 02:51.760
where my passion was and you know, looked at a couple of different labs and I'd always

02:51.760 --> 02:57.480
had an interest in neuroscience and kind of how the brain worked and so I wound up working

02:57.480 --> 03:02.240
with a professor who was in a biomedical engineering and mechanical engineering lab looking

03:02.240 --> 03:08.800
at how the brain encodes touch and so in particular studying the rat whiskers system.

03:08.800 --> 03:15.160
So I joined MATLAB, I started doing some behavioral as well as computational neuroscience work

03:15.160 --> 03:19.120
and really through that is how I kind of became exposed to machine learning.

03:19.120 --> 03:23.360
I really had it had any exposure or really knowledge of the field prior to that but

03:23.360 --> 03:29.320
just particularly through a neural coding project that I work on really started to learn

03:29.320 --> 03:34.920
about all of the you know, work that had been done in you know, pattern recognition and

03:34.920 --> 03:40.720
machine learning for years and really found that to be my passion and got involved in that.

03:40.720 --> 03:45.800
And then after graduating, I was actually at a insurance company doing predictive analytics

03:45.800 --> 03:50.880
for a year and then this position at STATS opened up where they are you know, creating

03:50.880 --> 03:57.960
a new AI data science team to you know, leverage this wealth of data that STATS has and to

03:57.960 --> 04:03.200
you know, produce new insights and you know, leverage machine learning and AI to really

04:03.200 --> 04:08.200
kind of revolutionize how we understand and ingest and even take sports data.

04:08.200 --> 04:09.200
Interesting.

04:09.200 --> 04:14.360
So that first exposure to machine learning from neuroscience perspective was that you

04:14.360 --> 04:17.840
mentioned that was a project that you worked on as opposed to a class.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.360
Can you elaborate on it?

04:19.360 --> 04:20.360
Sure.

04:20.360 --> 04:25.880
So one of the great things about my graduate school lab was that we were from all sorts

04:25.880 --> 04:27.560
of different departments.

04:27.560 --> 04:33.560
So I was in physics, we had applied math people, neuroscience students, BME students,

04:33.560 --> 04:37.880
MECI students all in the same lab which made it you know, a great really kind of fertile

04:37.880 --> 04:40.360
cross collaboration.

04:40.360 --> 04:45.240
And one of the students who was BME, more on the BME neuroscience side, he had been taking

04:45.240 --> 04:50.440
all of this neural recordings from primary sensory neurons and saying like, well, how do

04:50.440 --> 04:53.960
we understand what the brain is actually encoding?

04:53.960 --> 04:59.560
What is the actual original input and the appropriate representation that goes into the neurons

04:59.560 --> 05:05.720
that the rat could be using to make these discrimination tasks much higher up kind of

05:05.720 --> 05:09.000
later in the processing stage.

05:09.000 --> 05:12.760
And so I was asked to kind of be involved in the project and kind of help do that because

05:12.760 --> 05:16.840
I had the more you know, mathematical background.

05:16.840 --> 05:20.480
And so really was just kind of like here's here's a problem we're trying to solve.

05:20.480 --> 05:25.840
We have whiskers that are being tracked from there it goes into a mechanical model.

05:25.840 --> 05:29.800
We can get forces and moments and we want to predict and then we have neural recordings.

05:29.800 --> 05:33.800
We have an electrical signal from that we can extract spikes and we basically want to

05:33.800 --> 05:38.600
go from you know, mechanics to spikes and see where those see what the neurons are

05:38.600 --> 05:39.600
encoding.

05:39.600 --> 05:43.080
And in trying to solve it, that's really where I got you know, got exposed.

05:43.080 --> 05:47.520
And so, you know, we were using things like general literary models, but in the process

05:47.520 --> 05:52.320
of learning that, then I was just exposed to the whole you know, breath and wealth of techniques

05:52.320 --> 05:53.320
that were out there.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.320
Yeah.

05:54.320 --> 06:00.280
I never cease to be fascinated by this kind of two way relationship between neuroscience

06:00.280 --> 06:06.440
and machine learning where learning and being inspired by neuroscience to innovate on

06:06.440 --> 06:11.840
the machine learning side, but neuroscience is also benefiting heavily from that innovation

06:11.840 --> 06:18.400
and the way they understand neurons, super interesting work.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.400
What does that do?

06:19.400 --> 06:26.160
You know, you kind of mentioned sports and sports data, but what's the idea behind the company?

06:26.160 --> 06:27.160
Yeah.

06:27.160 --> 06:32.480
So, so, status has, you know, been around for about 35 years and we have this huge amount

06:32.480 --> 06:37.640
of data that we collect across all types of sports, you know, common sports that you

06:37.640 --> 06:41.760
think of, you know, football, basketball, baseball, but also something that you've probably

06:41.760 --> 06:45.400
never have and you'll, you'll, you'll never, never experience because they're, they're

06:45.400 --> 06:46.400
more remote.

06:46.400 --> 06:51.040
And so, we have all of, all of these kind of records and data that exists there, but in addition

06:51.040 --> 06:54.880
to that, you know, for certain sports, we have kind of a next level of data that's our

06:54.880 --> 06:55.880
event data.

06:55.880 --> 07:02.120
So, if you were to look at a sport like soccer, we know where, you know, we know information

07:02.120 --> 07:07.800
about passes and shots and things like that that we can use to further understand the game

07:07.800 --> 07:12.440
to really start telling, you know, a better story of what actually occurs and who's contributing

07:12.440 --> 07:13.640
and how.

07:13.640 --> 07:19.240
And then kind of as a, the layer on top of that, again, in sports like, like soccer and

07:19.240 --> 07:22.080
basketball, we have player and ball tracking information.

07:22.080 --> 07:27.000
So really at, at every point during a game, we know where all the players are on the field

07:27.000 --> 07:29.240
and we know where, where the ball is.

07:29.240 --> 07:33.480
And then that really allows us to tell, you know, an even richer story and understand

07:33.480 --> 07:39.520
the game and really kind of, you know, draw further insights and do more complex analysis

07:39.520 --> 07:43.400
to really recreate the game from, from this data.

07:43.400 --> 07:49.720
And who is the target or end consumer of the analysis that you're doing?

07:49.720 --> 07:54.560
Is it the teams or consumers like via media products?

07:54.560 --> 07:55.560
Right.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.160
So it spans, it spans everybody.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.120
A lot of it is media facing.

07:59.120 --> 08:03.760
So if you can imagine you're watching, watching a game and a lot of times an announcer will

08:03.760 --> 08:08.880
add some kind of statistics that have to add color to it, you know, very likely that data

08:08.880 --> 08:11.960
is coming from us.

08:11.960 --> 08:16.760
And you know, then even as a consumer, if you're, you know, going on to a site or you're

08:16.760 --> 08:23.280
asking, you know, first sports statistic, chances are we're providing that data as well.

08:23.280 --> 08:27.520
But also the teams, there's a, you know, team performance space where teams want to know,

08:27.520 --> 08:29.280
again, all of the stats about their players.

08:29.280 --> 08:33.880
And you know, now that as we're, you know, adding more advanced analytics on top of that

08:33.880 --> 08:37.920
through machine learning, you know, how can we actually deliver them insights directly

08:37.920 --> 08:41.360
as opposed to just maybe raw data points?

08:41.360 --> 08:42.360
Interesting.

08:42.360 --> 08:46.680
I must be the only one that thought that sports announcers just had these amazing statistical

08:46.680 --> 08:49.000
memories for their teams that they follow.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.000
Right.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Right.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
No, it's impressive.

08:52.000 --> 08:56.360
The amount of manpower from, you know, just at all levels, whether it's, you know,

08:56.360 --> 09:00.760
the kind of the engineering side that creates the database that stores it that allows that

09:00.760 --> 09:05.640
data to be accessed quickly to the more, you know, media facing people who are, you

09:05.640 --> 09:10.360
know, in the truck, knowing how to access that data and kind of find the right, you know,

09:10.360 --> 09:14.600
ask the right question to surface the right insight so that you can, can get that kind

09:14.600 --> 09:19.840
of interesting fact during, during the broadcast.

09:19.840 --> 09:24.640
Along those lines, can you talk a little bit about the, I guess your data pipeline, the

09:24.640 --> 09:29.520
way you kind of conceive of and mapping out all of the data that's coming in and the

09:29.520 --> 09:31.880
flows and how you process it?

09:31.880 --> 09:32.880
Sure.

09:32.880 --> 09:38.360
So a lot of that is very, very sport and also like data, data specific.

09:38.360 --> 09:43.560
So how we collect, what I'd call traditional box score data is different from, you know,

09:43.560 --> 09:44.560
the tracking data.

09:44.560 --> 09:50.880
So our group focuses primarily on how we make value out of the tracking data.

09:50.880 --> 09:57.040
So for a sport like basketball, for instance, you know, we have, you know, cameras in venue

09:57.040 --> 10:02.560
that would, you know, collect the, you know, track the players and then, you know, produce

10:02.560 --> 10:06.800
these, you know, process it using, you know, computer vision techniques and then extract

10:06.800 --> 10:11.160
the positions and then, you know, intake that for, for later analysis.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.960
And then our group is, you know, releasing, all right, now, you could imagine that the

10:14.960 --> 10:19.560
way you ingest and store data from just kind of a storage perspective is different than

10:19.560 --> 10:27.320
how you maybe want to format it to make discoveries and make insights and kind of surface them

10:27.320 --> 10:28.320
quickly.

10:28.320 --> 10:33.880
So a lot of the work that our group has done has been to really kind of look at a lot

10:33.880 --> 10:39.400
of the advances and technologies in the data space and the end, you know, some of the cloud

10:39.400 --> 10:45.880
computing and no SQL databases out there to, you know, how can we, how can we shape the

10:45.880 --> 10:52.320
data in a way that answers questions of interest and allows us to do the analysis that we want?

10:52.320 --> 10:57.120
You know, so then we can, you know, take this raw data and start, you know, start enriching

10:57.120 --> 10:59.120
it, start adding information on top of it.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.720
I'm going to, again, you could imagine that there's just, there's so much data that for

11:02.720 --> 11:08.160
a single game, you know, depending on the sport, 10, 20, you know, points per player per

11:08.160 --> 11:11.840
second across an entire game, there's, there's a huge amount of data there.

11:11.840 --> 11:16.480
So really leveraging a lot of those, uh, the big data stack that exists out there to

11:16.480 --> 11:21.120
process and analyze it and literally just kind of move it around so that it can be surface

11:21.120 --> 11:22.120
quickly.

11:22.120 --> 11:23.120
Interesting.

11:23.120 --> 11:31.280
So do you, does your group or even do you personally identify more with the data engineering

11:31.280 --> 11:38.960
and kind of infrastructure side of things or more the statistical analysis and the data

11:38.960 --> 11:41.120
product side of things?

11:41.120 --> 11:46.520
So we really get to interact with it from throughout the entire life cycle because, um,

11:46.520 --> 11:51.040
and I think that's really important because the, the representation and the, right, the

11:51.040 --> 11:56.120
way you encode and, and format and understanding records at your data is really critical

11:56.120 --> 11:59.480
for, for any analysis to occur downstream.

11:59.480 --> 12:03.120
So, you know, we work with engineering to actually like, you know, to build the products

12:03.120 --> 12:07.160
to put it into production, but, you know, we're, we're keenly involved in, in saying,

12:07.160 --> 12:11.280
what is that right representation, what is the right storage?

12:11.280 --> 12:15.960
How do we, um, you know, the, how do we format and store this data and describe this

12:15.960 --> 12:21.080
data in a way that really captures all the information and, and is, isn't lossy because

12:21.080 --> 12:26.080
we don't want to do anything to the data that could possibly, um, you know, lose information.

12:26.080 --> 12:30.000
And so we're certainly involved in kind of that, that early process and then we do, you

12:30.000 --> 12:34.080
know, work with, with engineering to, um, you know, to build out the pipelines that we

12:34.080 --> 12:38.960
can do the analysis, we build the models and then we get those models into production.

12:38.960 --> 12:43.960
And then we also interact closely with, um, with our design team as far as, all right,

12:43.960 --> 12:48.240
I, you can imagine, you know, I, I have a certain, a certain insight, a certain data point

12:48.240 --> 12:54.760
that I want to surface to the end user, but whether that end user is a team or a consumer

12:54.760 --> 13:00.680
or a media client, the same piece of information could be, uh, ingested in different ways.

13:00.680 --> 13:06.360
So what's the right way of presenting that to, you know, answer the questions that, that

13:06.360 --> 13:08.120
they're looking for?

13:08.120 --> 13:14.560
Do any particular examples come to mind of how the representation, you know, particularly

13:14.560 --> 13:21.240
as deep as, you know, the, the way the data was stored had an impact on the, the insights

13:21.240 --> 13:25.960
that you were ultimately able to derive or the models that you were ultimately able

13:25.960 --> 13:31.040
to create and kind of that back and forth between representation and, and product?

13:31.040 --> 13:32.040
Sure.

13:32.040 --> 13:35.400
So, um, you know, you, you could imagine that, you know, again, for our tracking data,

13:35.400 --> 13:38.720
we have all of the, the positions of the players.

13:38.720 --> 13:43.960
And, and there is so much information there that, you know, um, how it's stored, how it

13:43.960 --> 13:48.280
acts as access is, is very, very important for, for processing time, as well as our ability

13:48.280 --> 13:50.720
to do, um, to do analysis.

13:50.720 --> 13:56.080
So, um, one of the things that, that, you know, our group does is that we work directly on,

13:56.080 --> 13:57.080
on the trajectory.

13:57.080 --> 14:01.400
So given the players, um, you know, we can leverage both the individual player motions,

14:01.400 --> 14:05.440
as well as the group structure, uh, that's involved in sports to start, you know, to build

14:05.440 --> 14:07.960
our analysis to, to do our predictions.

14:07.960 --> 14:14.160
So, um, one of the challenging things with sport, you can imagine is that they're not just,

14:14.160 --> 14:18.480
you know, think of, think of basketball, they're not just five independent agents per,

14:18.480 --> 14:23.040
team, right, they're, they're interacting with people, um, with their, with their teammates,

14:23.040 --> 14:28.120
they're also interacting with the other, uh, their team, um, to try and understand an individual

14:28.120 --> 14:33.960
player's movement kind of in isolation is really losing that, that interactiveness, uh,

14:33.960 --> 14:34.960
that exists.

14:34.960 --> 14:40.120
In contrast to, um, say something like pedestrian detection where you have, uh, you know,

14:40.120 --> 14:44.040
we're, you know, a variable number of people out there and they're just kind of trying

14:44.040 --> 14:48.880
to avoid each other and things like that, right, there's a much more complexity in that

14:48.880 --> 14:51.800
kind of group behavior that exists in sports.

14:51.800 --> 14:57.600
And so we're really able to, um, exploit that and work on the trajectories, uh, together

14:57.600 --> 15:02.000
and understand that all of the players are really involved in interacting, um, and from

15:02.000 --> 15:06.800
their build our models, uh, which really allows us to, again, like, to work on that, that

15:06.800 --> 15:10.280
really true raw representation of the data.

15:10.280 --> 15:16.880
And so to make sure I understand that is there or at some point in designing this pipeline,

15:16.880 --> 15:22.960
this process, was there a trade-off between whether you stored player information individually

15:22.960 --> 15:27.560
or in the context of a team and you chose to do it in the context of a team?

15:27.560 --> 15:29.480
Is that what you're getting at here?

15:29.480 --> 15:35.280
So, so from the, from the data model, not as much, um, you know, you can imagine having,

15:35.280 --> 15:41.360
I think each player has, has a location, um, but then kind of once we have that stored,

15:41.360 --> 15:46.400
you know, how we leverage it is really, uh, kind of where the, where the keys are, and

15:46.400 --> 15:49.240
maybe I'm not quite, quite following your questions, are you?

15:49.240 --> 15:57.840
Oh, no, I was, I was going back to your comment about how you found it important to tie kind

15:57.840 --> 16:04.880
of the underlying data engineering to the kind of the work to be done and how you often

16:04.880 --> 16:09.200
find that, you know, the problems you're trying to solve influences the way you need to

16:09.200 --> 16:11.960
store and represent the data at a low level.

16:11.960 --> 16:18.200
And I was kind of digging for examples of, you know, where that low level representation,

16:18.200 --> 16:21.720
you know, made a big impact or you, you, you weren't able to accomplish something until

16:21.720 --> 16:23.960
you tweaked that low level representation.

16:23.960 --> 16:28.960
Sure, so, uh, right, really having, you know, information about all the players at every

16:28.960 --> 16:31.480
point in time, um, it is really key.

16:31.480 --> 16:35.400
And so kind of from a data perspective, that's, that's really where we operate.

16:35.400 --> 16:40.360
And then, you know, at the more of the modeling stage, I mean, if you look at a lot of the

16:40.360 --> 16:46.840
work that our group has done has been around, like leveraging the formational, uh, alignment

16:46.840 --> 16:52.000
of, of players so that we can really understand again operating directly off of the trajectories

16:52.000 --> 16:59.000
as opposed to, um, you know, having to, having to operate, um, yeah, let's see, I'm kind

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
of thinking about that.

17:00.000 --> 17:05.920
It sounds like maybe what I'm hearing that is, you, you may have this data that is, you

17:05.920 --> 17:10.560
know, it may come in as images, uh, and you have to figure out how to store that.

17:10.560 --> 17:19.160
And then you may extract from that x, y, positional information, uh, but you, you know, also

17:19.160 --> 17:24.480
want to eventually get to player trajectories and as opposed to having to figure that out

17:24.480 --> 17:26.320
each time you need to be able to store that.

17:26.320 --> 17:31.080
And so there's, there's this constant trying to figure out how to store these things that

17:31.080 --> 17:35.160
you're ultimately going to need to go further with your end products.

17:35.160 --> 17:36.160
Is that where you're going?

17:36.160 --> 17:37.160
Sure.

17:37.160 --> 17:41.200
That's certainly, um, you know, one aspect of it is, you know, extracting as much information

17:41.200 --> 17:45.440
as we can out of the image and then, you know, going through the whole tracking life cycle

17:45.440 --> 17:49.920
as if you will, you know, from detections to, to tracks to really understand, um, where

17:49.920 --> 17:55.200
all of the, uh, the players are, um, there's kind of a second step to that, which is, uh,

17:55.200 --> 17:59.200
the group has done a lot of work on search in sports.

17:59.200 --> 18:02.640
So, um, you could imagine that, you know, if you're watching a game and you see a play

18:02.640 --> 18:04.560
and you say, well, that's really interesting.

18:04.560 --> 18:07.680
I want to, I want to know if that's when that play has been run before.

18:07.680 --> 18:12.040
I want to find similar plays like how do you, how do you do that with, um, you know, multiple

18:12.040 --> 18:15.480
agents and how do you, how do you search for that?

18:15.480 --> 18:20.400
And you can imagine say, well, if I have, um, you know, all of my data coming in is, is

18:20.400 --> 18:21.720
based on player ID.

18:21.720 --> 18:25.720
I know that this human was standing in this position.

18:25.720 --> 18:30.840
But if I'm only looking, if I limit myself to only looking by based on identity, um, it

18:30.840 --> 18:35.640
really kind of limits my ability to find, um, to find those similar plays.

18:35.640 --> 18:41.680
So, uh, a lot of the work that the group has done is to, uh, recognize, again, that, that

18:41.680 --> 18:47.440
group structure and to find, um, the, uh, the, the right way to represent them so that

18:47.440 --> 18:53.600
we can, um, find plays based on where a player is in their, uh, positional formation as

18:53.600 --> 18:56.280
opposed to being like kind of stuck to the identity.

18:56.280 --> 18:58.360
So certainly there's kind of two phases there.

18:58.360 --> 19:02.440
There's the, I want to be able to represent the data in my data models that I have all

19:02.440 --> 19:04.120
of it available to me.

19:04.120 --> 19:08.400
And then if I want to be able to query it, I don't want to be necessarily bound to something

19:08.400 --> 19:09.840
as hard as identity.

19:09.840 --> 19:15.080
I want to know, um, where the player is in their, in their group position.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.080
Interesting.

19:16.080 --> 19:20.640
So this search function that you're describing, it's not relying at all.

19:20.640 --> 19:27.000
It sounds like on tagged, uh, this is a X play, like a named play or something like that.

19:27.000 --> 19:31.400
It's based on kind of the relative positions of the players.

19:31.400 --> 19:32.400
Correct.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.400
Right.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.760
We want to learn the playbook directly from the data.

19:34.760 --> 19:38.440
So you could imagine a coach, you know, having to go through and say, all right, like,

19:38.440 --> 19:42.320
here's, here's play, here's play alpha, here's, here's play beta, whatever.

19:42.320 --> 19:47.320
Um, and that's obviously very, you know, onerous and time consuming on, on the coach.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.760
Um, but again, you see, you see the structure that exists in sport.

19:50.760 --> 19:55.760
You see certain actions, certain plays that get run repeatedly.

19:55.760 --> 20:00.360
And if, if we can recognize those as kind of entities, you know, our ourselves who are

20:00.360 --> 20:04.480
watching the game, you know, the computer should be able to learn how to do that, uh, by

20:04.480 --> 20:05.720
leveraging machine learning.

20:05.720 --> 20:11.160
So what we're able to do is to, um, to find those similar plays just directly from the

20:11.160 --> 20:16.200
ball and, and player trajectories so that you could imagine, like, here's a similar play.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.200
Here's a play.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.200
Can I find all of the plays just like that?

20:19.200 --> 20:20.200
Huh.

20:20.200 --> 20:26.600
Can you, can you walk us through the, kind of the types of models that you use to do this,

20:26.600 --> 20:30.880
like the input data sounds like positions and trajectories?

20:30.880 --> 20:35.800
Like how do you, uh, how, how does it work, I guess, you know, to the extent that you can

20:35.800 --> 20:36.800
share it?

20:36.800 --> 20:37.800
Sure.

20:37.800 --> 20:41.640
And again, like members of the group have done, um, a lot of work on this, uh, for a

20:41.640 --> 20:42.640
while.

20:42.640 --> 20:45.120
And it's a little bit, you know, the way we've actually implemented it for different sports

20:45.120 --> 20:47.000
is has some slight subtleties.

20:47.000 --> 20:52.720
But what the general idea is that, um, we kind of, we're able to, to using the trajectories

20:52.720 --> 20:58.680
of all of the players, find where they kind of fit into a, um, into a formation.

20:58.680 --> 21:04.160
So we find some kind of, um, ordering that, that preserves the, the structure.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.160
And then from there.

21:05.160 --> 21:10.440
And so if I can, if I can push pause on that, what is, what does that mean?

21:10.440 --> 21:12.840
Like how, how are you representing that?

21:12.840 --> 21:17.840
Is this like, uh, you know, a, a spatial type of model?

21:17.840 --> 21:24.240
Like position one is, you know, X, uh, you know, some distance and angle from another

21:24.240 --> 21:26.400
or is it some other kind of thing?

21:26.400 --> 21:27.400
Right.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.640
So, um, it's, in, in some ways, more, more general than that.

21:30.640 --> 21:36.280
So you could imagine for, um, for a sport like soccer, that you say, well, here's, here's

21:36.280 --> 21:37.280
the center back.

21:37.280 --> 21:40.960
And again, you could imagine somebody going through and actually tagging all of the players,

21:40.960 --> 21:45.200
um, but players, players swap positions, uh, they move around.

21:45.200 --> 21:49.680
And so somebody who's kind of nominally in one position in a given play, they might have,

21:49.680 --> 21:53.760
you know, switched with, with their partner just to, to get, you know, back into defensive

21:53.760 --> 21:56.200
position to have all of the spots filled.

21:56.200 --> 22:00.360
And so what we're able to do is say, well, I can actually learn directly from the data

22:00.360 --> 22:04.120
um, the, the formation that this team plays.

22:04.120 --> 22:09.480
And so even though this person is maybe nominally a left back in this particular play, he got,

22:09.480 --> 22:13.840
you know, he had a switch, you know, places with, with somebody else and he's actually playing

22:13.840 --> 22:15.520
on the right side right now.

22:15.520 --> 22:19.920
And so from their positions, we're actually able to, you know, match them back to, to a

22:19.920 --> 22:25.760
known, uh, known formation and then use their, use their positions at that time, um,

22:25.760 --> 22:29.480
not just some kind of hard coded, uh, tag.

22:29.480 --> 22:35.040
And that really allows us to, to understand, um, their positioning based on, on where

22:35.040 --> 22:40.360
they are in this, again, in this kind of group, formational structure as opposed to, um,

22:40.360 --> 22:43.440
you know, a label that's fixed throughout the course of the game.

22:43.440 --> 22:44.440
Okay.

22:44.440 --> 22:51.680
So the first step is kind of, uh, representing the general formation of the team.

22:51.680 --> 22:56.680
So the player is relative to one another, uh, and then what's next?

22:56.680 --> 23:02.320
So, so once we understand where the players are in relationship to, to their, you know,

23:02.320 --> 23:06.040
their formational template, like that allows us to then say, all right, you know, given

23:06.040 --> 23:11.280
that I know they're here, I can start to, I can maintain a certain ordering, um, and,

23:11.280 --> 23:15.200
you know, the, for, for machine learning, uh, NAI to work, you know, the computer needs

23:15.200 --> 23:22.400
to have some kind of, you know, fixed expectation of how, um, you know, of the incoming order

23:22.400 --> 23:24.440
of, of the features that you're going to pass to it.

23:24.440 --> 23:27.960
So you can imagine that, you know, by knowing where the players are and where they fall

23:27.960 --> 23:34.520
in the structure, this allows us to, um, you know, to have that fixed representation

23:34.520 --> 23:35.520
of where they are.

23:35.520 --> 23:38.960
And then from there, we can do, you know, any sort of analysis on top of it.

23:38.960 --> 23:43.880
If it's, you know, in this case for search, um, it allows us to start, you know, creating

23:43.880 --> 23:49.880
a consistent metric so that we're comparing, um, comparing, you know, the, the person in,

23:49.880 --> 23:55.880
um, the left-back position always to, you know, other left-backs, even if at the start

23:55.880 --> 24:01.200
of the game that he might have been listed as a, as a different positional player.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.240
And you have this formation information.

24:03.240 --> 24:09.760
Do you look at transitions of that formation from, you know, A to B to C relative to the

24:09.760 --> 24:12.280
movement of the ball or things like that over time?

24:12.280 --> 24:15.520
Like I guess, you know, the picture that I have in my head when you talk about plays

24:15.520 --> 24:21.880
is like your classic, like, uh, clipboard, you know, player here, player here and then transitions

24:21.880 --> 24:24.320
or trajectories or something like that.

24:24.320 --> 24:29.080
And I'm trying to map all that to, uh, to the machine learning context and what you're

24:29.080 --> 24:30.080
doing.

24:30.080 --> 24:31.080
Sure.

24:31.080 --> 24:34.040
So you could imagine as kind of a base level, you could just say, well, I, I think there's

24:34.040 --> 24:37.840
some kind of general formation out there, you know, maybe that, that a team has and

24:37.840 --> 24:39.160
you can certainly learn that.

24:39.160 --> 24:44.560
And then you can say, well, you know, particularly in soccer as the, um, you know, as the ball

24:44.560 --> 24:49.480
moves as a team transitions from defense to offense, you really kind of see that, that

24:49.480 --> 24:50.480
formation change.

24:50.480 --> 24:55.480
You might see them become more aggressive offensively as they get the ball, um, near their attacking

24:55.480 --> 24:56.480
goal.

24:56.480 --> 25:00.360
And you can see the defenders kind of kind of step up and so that, that formation changes.

25:00.360 --> 25:06.580
So by using, um, various hierarchical methods, we can actually learn, you know, a set or

25:06.580 --> 25:11.720
relationship of, of these different formations and then look to see, well, okay, how does that,

25:11.720 --> 25:14.520
how does it change, um, you know, does, does that formation change?

25:14.520 --> 25:20.360
When I'm on an offense versus defense, when I have the ball closer to my goal, um, what

25:20.360 --> 25:22.200
happens if I'm winning or are losing?

25:22.200 --> 25:28.800
Do I start to kind of change that, um, change that formation to, to protect my lead as opposed

25:28.800 --> 25:31.040
to being more aggressive and trying to score?

25:31.040 --> 25:35.960
Um, and so like we have, we have observed those changes, but because we're able to detect

25:35.960 --> 25:39.640
that automatically from the data, you know, it's not something that we have to go through

25:39.640 --> 25:43.960
and kind of get painstakingly labeled, it just, it, it's something that we can detect

25:43.960 --> 25:44.960
automatically.

25:44.960 --> 25:45.960
Right.

25:45.960 --> 25:48.480
The, you mentioned hierarchical methods.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.240
Can you elaborate on that?

25:50.240 --> 25:51.240
So sure.

25:51.240 --> 25:56.280
So one of our team members had done work particularly and basketball on this just as we're,

25:56.280 --> 26:00.080
as we're learning these, um, these kind of different, uh, different templates for these

26:00.080 --> 26:07.120
different states, um, he has an approach to do, um, multi agent hierarchical clustering.

26:07.120 --> 26:14.080
So again, we have trajectories for, uh, you know, uh, for all of the players and we can

26:14.080 --> 26:18.440
say, all right, like what's the, how do we find kind of again that, that base formation?

26:18.440 --> 26:22.560
And then from there saying, all right, like this is kind of, this is a certain, a certain

26:22.560 --> 26:23.560
state.

26:23.560 --> 26:28.960
And then we kind of step into that and say, um, all right, like what's the right way to

26:28.960 --> 26:33.440
essentially, um, you know, order of players within that, within that state.

26:33.440 --> 26:37.240
And then from there, can I split that out, do substates exist, um, you know, are there

26:37.240 --> 26:42.040
additional, um, you know, clusters within there and kind of keep, keep breaking down and

26:42.040 --> 26:46.840
doing this approach until we can, you know, find these very specific, um, play states

26:46.840 --> 26:48.760
that, that we can, can identify.

26:48.760 --> 26:55.160
I came across a paper that you co-authored about myth-busting set pieces and soccer.

26:55.160 --> 26:56.160
Uh-huh.

26:56.160 --> 26:59.280
Can you share, uh, what that one is about?

26:59.280 --> 27:05.800
So this is a paper that, um, that we, uh, presented at Sloan this past year and, uh, set pieces

27:05.800 --> 27:10.720
are, you know, something that teams are really interested in because, um, you know, they,

27:10.720 --> 27:14.760
they can, you know, produce a lot of, um, scoring opportunities, but there's also some myths

27:14.760 --> 27:19.600
about, well, when I, um, you know, when I take a set piece, if I'm too aggressive, like

27:19.600 --> 27:23.040
is it going to lead, you know, to a chance by the other team?

27:23.040 --> 27:28.000
And so really, the idea here was to just kind of go through, um, some of the commonly

27:28.000 --> 27:32.360
held, uh, held beliefs are, around set pieces and really just, you know, look at, look at

27:32.360 --> 27:33.360
what the data says.

27:33.360 --> 27:38.000
Instead of going, you know, by, by your gut, can we actually go through and, and, and kind

27:38.000 --> 27:41.560
of tick these off and say, you know, what does the data actually support?

27:41.560 --> 27:46.440
And I think that's one of the, you know, really exciting things about what we do in this

27:46.440 --> 27:50.840
group is that, um, you know, a lot of people, you know, whether it's coach, whether it's

27:50.840 --> 27:54.600
a fan, they've, you know, seen a lot of sport they have and tuition for it.

27:54.600 --> 27:59.160
They have, um, you know, these kind of gut, gut instances to what's there.

27:59.160 --> 28:05.080
But really with the availability of, of tracking data, we can actually get to what, what

28:05.080 --> 28:09.320
the data says and actually answer these types of questions that really just aren't, aren't

28:09.320 --> 28:12.520
available, um, otherwise.

28:12.520 --> 28:18.720
And for those that don't know set pieces or like corner cakes and free kicks and soccer.

28:18.720 --> 28:19.720
Yes.

28:19.720 --> 28:20.720
Yeah.

28:20.720 --> 28:23.120
And another question I had was in that paper there where you hasn't like, it really

28:23.120 --> 28:31.360
interesting heat maps of the player positions relative to these set pieces is that produced

28:31.360 --> 28:36.040
from the like the visual positioning data that you get.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.040
Correct.

28:37.040 --> 28:40.880
So, you know, at a certain level, we can just look to, you know, look at the ball on C where

28:40.880 --> 28:46.000
teams attempt to, to deliver a kick, uh, in these scenarios, but then we can kind of go

28:46.000 --> 28:50.720
a step further and say, all right, let's use the tracking data to maybe understand how,

28:50.720 --> 28:53.520
teams defend corners, for instance.

28:53.520 --> 28:59.040
And so in that case, again, we have the, we have all the player tracking data and using

28:59.040 --> 29:06.160
a convolutional or neural net, we can try, we can, you know, use, use the data and determine

29:06.160 --> 29:10.680
whether a team is in a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a defense or a man-demand

29:10.680 --> 29:12.960
defense or something and more of a hybrid.

29:12.960 --> 29:16.400
And then once we have, we're able to detect that, then we can say, all right, like does

29:16.400 --> 29:21.960
that lead to do, do any of these, um, lead to more goals than, than the other?

29:21.960 --> 29:27.360
So this sounds like it maybe ties to some of the, the previous work that we discussed

29:27.360 --> 29:32.120
where you've figured out through maybe these hierarchical approaches that you've used

29:32.120 --> 29:37.000
or the, the templates, like, you know, these types of defenses and then you've, maybe

29:37.000 --> 29:41.960
have those labeled somewhere as like labeled pictures, you know, this is, this defense

29:41.960 --> 29:48.760
this is another, and then you use that as the input to, uh, CNN classifier to figure

29:48.760 --> 29:50.480
out, uh, for a given image.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.480
Is that what you're doing?

29:51.480 --> 29:52.480
Right.

29:52.480 --> 29:56.120
So in the case of, of set pieces, it's a little bit different than, than open play.

29:56.120 --> 30:01.160
Like you imagine it, in open play, again, there's this really strong, formational signature

30:01.160 --> 30:08.040
that exists, um, for something like a corner, the way player set up is, um, more, more chaotic,

30:08.040 --> 30:12.120
uh, it kind of lacks that, that, you know, strong and form, formation that, that you

30:12.120 --> 30:13.120
would imagine.

30:13.120 --> 30:19.120
Um, and so here we actually, um, in this work, just operated like directly on, um, I'm

30:19.120 --> 30:23.160
like the image representation of the player, so you can imagine, um, you know, knowing where

30:23.160 --> 30:28.400
each player is thinking of it, um, you know, as, as having a, uh, point, point in an image

30:28.400 --> 30:30.000
being being occupied.

30:30.000 --> 30:34.440
And then from there saying, right, if I know how they're moving, I can, um, detect certain,

30:34.440 --> 30:39.160
certain features, you know, using the CNN, uh, and then from some labels.

30:39.160 --> 30:43.360
So, um, so Paul, who was the first author on the paper, um, he has a, you know, tremendous

30:43.360 --> 30:46.000
background, uh, in, in soccer.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.640
And so, um, he was able to, you know, to go through and like, look at, look at the video,

30:49.640 --> 30:53.880
look at the trajectories and say, all right, this is a, this isn't, uh, example of, of

30:53.880 --> 30:57.480
a hybrid defense, as opposed to a man defense, as opposed to a zone defense.

30:57.480 --> 31:02.560
And then once we have those, um, you know, it build the, the class fire to detect those

31:02.560 --> 31:08.480
automatically going forward, you, you took like a myth busting type of approach, uh, in

31:08.480 --> 31:14.840
the paper, obviously given the title and you identified 10 specific, uh, myths that

31:14.840 --> 31:21.120
folks held about these types of situations, like, um, a team is more likely to score from

31:21.120 --> 31:24.320
a free kick cross compared to a corner.

31:24.320 --> 31:29.800
And then why you busted that myth and show, no, there's only a 2% chance of, of scoring

31:29.800 --> 31:35.400
from the corner, as opposed to a 1% chance of scoring from the, the free kick.

31:35.400 --> 31:38.840
And there were a bunch of other, of these types of myths.

31:38.840 --> 31:45.800
Was there any that was most kind of surprising or, or interesting to the team?

31:45.800 --> 31:50.640
I think the, the work that just, um, you know, I, I, identifying the defenses, uh, that

31:50.640 --> 31:55.280
the teams are playing was really interesting, just cut seeing the, the relative frequencies

31:55.280 --> 31:57.360
that that each played in was interesting.

31:57.360 --> 32:02.200
Well, I think the one that I think most surprised, uh, most people on the team was about, um,

32:02.200 --> 32:04.240
defending, uh, defending the post.

32:04.240 --> 32:10.240
So I think a lot of people, um, believe that, you know, you should put a man on, on at

32:10.240 --> 32:15.760
least one of the posts near and or far, um, but what, uh, you know, what this work showed

32:15.760 --> 32:20.360
was that, um, having players on both posts actually, you know, conceded the most number

32:20.360 --> 32:24.720
of goals, um, while having a player on, on the back post, uh, conceded the, conceded

32:24.720 --> 32:30.640
the fewest and, um, you know, in some ways, you say, well, I, I, I don't know, I, I know,

32:30.640 --> 32:33.520
you know, by, by putting a player on the post, you're, you're certainly kind of cutting

32:33.520 --> 32:37.920
down on the angle, but you're in some ways giving the offense more freedom to, to move

32:37.920 --> 32:38.920
around.

32:38.920 --> 32:43.560
So I think that's one instance where people have really strong feelings either, either

32:43.560 --> 32:48.240
way, you know, one way or the other, um, so, uh, I think that was probably the most,

32:48.240 --> 32:51.240
most surprising to, to members of the team.

32:51.240 --> 32:56.920
Can you talk a little bit about the way you processed your data for, for this particular

32:56.920 --> 32:57.920
task?

32:57.920 --> 32:58.920
Um, right.

32:58.920 --> 33:02.920
So, so for all of this, you know, we've leveraged both the event data that we have,

33:02.920 --> 33:08.520
again, that has things like, um, shots, passes, crosses, corners, the type of pass where

33:08.520 --> 33:13.160
it occurred from, who took it, um, as well as, as well as the tracking data.

33:13.160 --> 33:17.040
And so, um, you know, like in, in much of the work that we do, it's really a matter of,

33:17.040 --> 33:21.880
of bringing them all together, um, and here was a combination of both, you know, in some

33:21.880 --> 33:27.200
cases, constructing features, you know, by hand that we can analyze, um, as well as,

33:27.200 --> 33:32.400
you know, in the case of like detecting the defense, um, you know, using, using, uh, you

33:32.400 --> 33:35.240
know, deep learning approaches to, in some way, you know, construct the features for

33:35.240 --> 33:36.240
us.

33:36.240 --> 33:40.600
Um, so, you know, it was, uh, a really nice paper because it really brought together

33:40.600 --> 33:44.720
in, in some ways, like, all facets of both the data and the, and the, uh, analysis

33:44.720 --> 33:49.120
side, the events and the tracking, as well as kind of the handcrafted features, as well

33:49.120 --> 33:51.240
as the, uh, the deep learned features.

33:51.240 --> 33:58.960
And in, in addition to the specific, uh, the, the myths that you busted, you also looked

33:58.960 --> 34:06.040
at the predictive power of the, the model, like the model's ability to predict whether

34:06.040 --> 34:13.680
a given team, you know, what formation a, a team is likely to take given, uh, one of

34:13.680 --> 34:20.000
these set points or set pieces, rather, um, how successful was that part of the project?

34:20.000 --> 34:27.240
Um, are you talking about the, um, defense or, or just like the, the general, um, set

34:27.240 --> 34:28.240
up part?

34:28.240 --> 34:36.360
Uh, well, I, I, I, I, I thought I saw it in there, an element of predicting what a given

34:36.360 --> 34:41.280
team was likely to do, I guess, defensively, uh, okay, sure, right.

34:41.280 --> 34:46.000
So, you know, again, this, this used both the, the events as well as the tracking data,

34:46.000 --> 34:49.480
but, um, you know, we can go through and look at, you know, all, all of the set pieces

34:49.480 --> 34:54.440
that, um, a team has taken over the course of the season and say, all right, you know,

34:54.440 --> 34:58.680
offensively, do they take, you know, in swinging and outs or versus out swinging corners,

34:58.680 --> 35:02.240
you know, short corners, um, you know, do they attempt to do flick-ons?

35:02.240 --> 35:08.560
Um, and how often, you know, do they, you know, try to use the style as well as how successful

35:08.560 --> 35:12.200
are they at, at executing, uh, on that style?

35:12.200 --> 35:16.960
And then defensively, again, you know, having been able to detect the type of, of set-ups

35:16.960 --> 35:22.160
that they use, um, you know, how likely are they to set up in a certain situation?

35:22.160 --> 35:28.240
And then, um, you know, when they set up that way, how likely is that to, to lead to a goal?

35:28.240 --> 35:33.600
And so at, at a glance, we can kind of look at teams and their, um, frequency and their

35:33.600 --> 35:38.520
success in each of these styles and say, you know, what, how do they likely play or when

35:38.520 --> 35:39.520
they're playing well?

35:39.520 --> 35:41.000
How, how do they likely set up?

35:41.000 --> 35:46.760
And then from there, we can say, okay, um, you know, given two teams, I can imagine, um,

35:46.760 --> 35:50.640
you know, predicting, you know, the, given the offensive style of one and the defensive

35:50.640 --> 35:53.720
style of the other, how might they match up?

35:53.720 --> 35:59.560
It sounds like the, the predictions that you were doing about, you know, what a team is

35:59.560 --> 36:05.000
likely to do in any given situation, we're not match-up based, I don't know if this question

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
makes any sense.

36:06.000 --> 36:11.440
I think what you're getting at is, um, so in, in this particular paper, we didn't, um,

36:11.440 --> 36:14.080
we didn't do predictions off of the, the match-up.

36:14.080 --> 36:15.080
That's kind of the, yeah.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.080
The next step.

36:16.080 --> 36:22.160
You know, what we are looking at here is kind of how, how strong is the stylistic signature

36:22.160 --> 36:23.160
of a team?

36:23.160 --> 36:27.000
You know, certain teams, you could imagine that, um, they might want to take, you know,

36:27.000 --> 36:31.320
the same, the same corner, the same way, every single time, regardless of, of who they're

36:31.320 --> 36:33.320
playing or how, how the defense sets up.

36:33.320 --> 36:36.760
Maybe they're very, very predictable just historically.

36:36.760 --> 36:41.440
But another team could be, um, you know, it's, I don't, I don't really care how I take

36:41.440 --> 36:42.440
it.

36:42.440 --> 36:43.440
I just want to do whatever is the most effective.

36:43.440 --> 36:47.440
So I'm going to look at the defense and whatever they present, you know, to me, I'm going

36:47.440 --> 36:51.360
to take whatever I feel is, is the best approach in, in that moment.

36:51.360 --> 36:56.040
And so here it was more of a, how predictable is a team historically.

36:56.040 --> 37:00.760
But again, once you've kind of created this, this, you know, style analysis of the team,

37:00.760 --> 37:06.160
the next step is to say, all right, you know, given two teams, how do I expect them to,

37:06.160 --> 37:07.160
to interact?

37:07.160 --> 37:08.160
Awesome.

37:08.160 --> 37:09.160
Awesome.

37:09.160 --> 37:13.760
Well, what are some, uh, some other interesting projects on your roadmap or to-do lists?

37:13.760 --> 37:22.400
How do you see kind of the application of ML and deep learning and, uh, AI evolving

37:22.400 --> 37:24.040
as applied to sports?

37:24.040 --> 37:25.040
Yeah.

37:25.040 --> 37:29.800
So the availability of tracking data really kind of, you know, leaves us with, with endless

37:29.800 --> 37:30.800
possibilities.

37:30.800 --> 37:36.000
There's, you know, so much that we can do there to understand, again, the plays that teams

37:36.000 --> 37:42.400
run, um, to identify, to identify plays and then to predict, um, to predict future plays

37:42.400 --> 37:47.400
to do things like, um, right, to, to predict where the players will, will be.

37:47.400 --> 37:52.400
So another paper, you know, that, that our group was involved with through a collaboration,

37:52.400 --> 37:57.000
uh, with, with, uh, Disney, you know, the past couple of years was, um, it's actually

37:57.000 --> 38:00.840
through a, through a collaboration with, um, with Disney research, the, the past two

38:00.840 --> 38:04.280
years, there's been some work at Sloan on, on ghosting.

38:04.280 --> 38:08.640
So originally it was on a software and this past year for, for basketball, where, um,

38:08.640 --> 38:13.560
you know, given the, um, offensive players, like, could you, you know, predict, you know,

38:13.560 --> 38:15.840
where the, the defensive players are?

38:15.840 --> 38:19.520
Um, and so there's, you know, a lot of interesting things there.

38:19.520 --> 38:25.000
We have this huge wealth of data and with, um, you know, the, all the advances in, um,

38:25.000 --> 38:29.920
she learning in particular and deep learning, we can start to do really fine grain analysis

38:29.920 --> 38:34.920
and simulation, uh, predicting where the players are, where they'll go, what type of plays

38:34.920 --> 38:35.920
to be run.

38:35.920 --> 38:40.000
Um, there's really just a huge amount of, of different avenues that, that you can go

38:40.000 --> 38:41.000
there.

38:41.000 --> 38:45.320
And, you know, it's really all, you know, largely driven by the data and having access

38:45.320 --> 38:50.480
to the data is really what enables us to ask these, you know, very specific, um, questions.

38:50.480 --> 38:54.960
What if, um, you know, given, given a play and I have a shot, um, you know, what, um,

38:54.960 --> 38:56.440
what if I move players around?

38:56.440 --> 38:59.400
What if a different player took, um, took the shot?

38:59.400 --> 39:04.320
Uh, there's a lot of opportunities to do, um, personalized, uh, modeling, which we've,

39:04.320 --> 39:05.320
we've done.

39:05.320 --> 39:09.840
So as I was explaining it, again, like, given, given a certain play, um, you know, what

39:09.840 --> 39:14.040
happens if there's a different defender, a different, a different shooter, what happens

39:14.040 --> 39:19.000
if the, the angle or the, the distances are just slightly different, um, how does that

39:19.000 --> 39:24.280
impact the outcome and then building up from single plays to, to more complex, um, kind

39:24.280 --> 39:26.160
of longer scale activities?

39:26.160 --> 39:32.400
Uh, you, you mentioned in there how this all kind of revolves around having access to

39:32.400 --> 39:40.560
the data, uh, I'm curious in your, what's your sense for how accessible sports applications

39:40.560 --> 39:44.560
of ML are for hobbyists?

39:44.560 --> 39:50.800
Like are there, are there freely available, uh, or open source data sets that, um, you're

39:50.800 --> 39:55.320
familiar with that folks could use to play around with, certainly, you know, clearly sports

39:55.320 --> 39:59.400
is a hobby for a lot of people and data science is, uh, you know, a hobby or interest for a

39:59.400 --> 40:04.440
lot of people that folks wanted to combine those two and get started, um, are there ways

40:04.440 --> 40:10.840
to, uh, do interesting things or, you know, are all the data sources kind of proprietary

40:10.840 --> 40:11.840
collected?

40:11.840 --> 40:16.320
You know, I, I think at the past, certainly for my experience, you know, the, you know,

40:16.320 --> 40:19.920
before I was here, you know, a lot of times people looking for sports data were kind of,

40:19.920 --> 40:25.440
um, you know, limited to, to try and discrete things off of websites and that to, to, to

40:25.440 --> 40:26.440
build their models.

40:26.440 --> 40:31.440
Um, you know, we actually, uh, through some of the papers that, um, that, that our group

40:31.440 --> 40:36.200
has published have three data sets out there that, that people can, you know, quest for,

40:36.200 --> 40:41.360
for research purposes, um, you know, one of them is, um, in, in soccer, one of them is

40:41.360 --> 40:42.360
in basketball.

40:42.360 --> 40:47.600
Those are both trajectory based, um, related to, to the, uh, to, you know, the trajectory

40:47.600 --> 40:50.280
analysis, um, that we've done.

40:50.280 --> 40:56.480
So we have, um, actually through, uh, our website have three, uh, data sets that, that

40:56.480 --> 41:01.960
people can request to do, um, to do, you know, academic research work, you know, hobbyist

41:01.960 --> 41:06.680
type, type analysis, um, two of them are trajectory based, one of them for soccer, one of them

41:06.680 --> 41:07.680
for basketball.

41:07.680 --> 41:12.600
They're probably more complex, you know, it's, it's just literally like x, y position

41:12.600 --> 41:13.600
of the players.

41:13.600 --> 41:18.000
So, um, you don't have to use some sophisticated techniques there to really kind of parse

41:18.000 --> 41:23.280
it and understand it, um, because it's, you know, again, pretty, pretty complex data, um,

41:23.280 --> 41:28.440
but one of the other papers that we had at Sloan, uh, this past year was doing, um, uh, wind

41:28.440 --> 41:29.760
probability analysis.

41:29.760 --> 41:35.520
And so there is, uh, data, another data set that we have where, um, you can, you know,

41:35.520 --> 41:39.680
look at that data to, to recreate some of, some of those results.

41:39.680 --> 41:42.880
And probably I'd say like for the, for the general public, that's probably the, um, you

41:42.880 --> 41:47.600
know, most accessible, accessible one, um, you know, that if players wanted to, or that

41:47.600 --> 41:51.840
if people wanted to get their, their hands dirty with, you know, it's really, uh, unique

41:51.840 --> 41:55.000
set of data that, that they can use to answer a bunch of questions.

41:55.000 --> 41:59.760
Well, Jennifer, thanks so much for taking the time to share what you're working on.

41:59.760 --> 42:01.240
It sounds like really fun stuff.

42:01.240 --> 42:02.240
Yep.

42:02.240 --> 42:03.240
Yeah, it's great.

42:03.240 --> 42:07.400
You know, we, we have, uh, really the huge amount of data out there that, that we can

42:07.400 --> 42:11.680
do, you know, really interesting things with, you know, across, across a variety of sports.

42:11.680 --> 42:15.960
Um, you know, it's, it's ever evolving and, and, you know, with, uh, a lot of the advances

42:15.960 --> 42:20.760
over the, the past, you know, several years, um, really kind of the sky is the limit

42:20.760 --> 42:25.160
as far as what we can explore and what kind of new, new data points we can reveal and, and

42:25.160 --> 42:28.040
interesting questions that we can ask and answer.

42:28.040 --> 42:29.040
Fantastic.

42:29.040 --> 42:30.040
Thank you.

42:30.040 --> 42:31.040
All right.

42:31.040 --> 42:32.040
Thank you so much.
