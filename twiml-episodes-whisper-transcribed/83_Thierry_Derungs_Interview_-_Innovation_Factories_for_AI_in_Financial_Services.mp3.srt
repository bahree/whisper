00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,880
people doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,440
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,040
This week on the podcast features a series of conversations with speakers from the AI

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,840
Summit in New York City.

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,120
The theme of that conference and this series is AI in the Enterprise and I think you'll

7
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,160
find a really interesting mix of both technical and case study oriented discussions this week.

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,280
Please note that on Wednesday December 13th we'll be holding our last Twimble online

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,280
meet-up of the year.

10
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,440
Bring your thoughts on the top machine learning and AI stories of 2017 for our discussion

11
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,760
segment and for our main presentation Bruno Gensalves will be discussing the paper understanding

12
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,960
deep learning requires rethinking generalization by Shi Yuan Zhang from MIT and Google Brain

13
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,200
and others.

14
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,160
You can find more details and register at twimbleai.com slash meet-up.

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,280
Today's show continues our discussion of Enterprise AI with a conversation with Terry

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:24,840
Deroong's chief digital officer at BNP Paribus a multinational bank headquartered in Paris.

17
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,120
Terry joined me to discuss how BNP uses AI and some of the opportunities that have arisen

18
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:34,160
with the changing artificial intelligence landscape.

19
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:39,400
We also discuss the innovation process that BNP is used to introduce AI to the bank via

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,200
what they call innovation incubators or factories.

21
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,360

22
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,840
This AI summit series is brought to you by our friends at IBM Power Systems.

23
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,440
IBM Power Systems offers servers designed for mission critical applications and emerging

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:05,240
workloads including artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, advanced

25
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,920
analytics, and high performance computing.

26
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:14,120
IBM Power Systems benefit from a wide range of open technologies, many stemming from

27
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,440
collaboration with fellow open power foundation members and their design to deliver performance

28
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,640
efficiently, whether deployed in private, public, or hybrid clouds.

31
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,960
And now onto the show.

32
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:45,400
All right, everyone.

33
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,960
I am on the line with Terry Derung's.

34
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:56,200
Terry is the Chief Digital Officer at BNP Paribus Wealth Management.

35
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:00,680
And he is, we're connecting today, he's in Paris.

36
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,920
And Terry, I'm very grateful for you to spend some time with us.

37
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
My pleasure.

38
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,920
Absolutely.

39
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,680
So, all right, Terry, why don't we get started by having you introduce yourself to the

40
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,400
audience and tell us a little bit about your background and how you came to be interested

41
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,920
and involved in artificial intelligence?

42
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,920
Sure.

43
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,080
Today, I'm the Chief Digital Officer for BNP Paribus Management.

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,360
As you mentioned, yeah, I have a very long story around digital since I'm busy with digital

45
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:41,640
topics since almost 25 years when the CDO title was not yet imagined and already working

46
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,480
for many digital solutions on public sites and secure sites.

47
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,840
So a very long background.

48
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:56,280
And of course, as a CDO, yeah, you are looking for the new technologies and all the opportunities

49
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,800
that can be raised by them.

50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
Right.

51
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:26,720
And for those that aren't familiar with BNP Paribus, can you give a little bit of an overview

52
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,440
of the firm?

53
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,520
BNP Paribus is what we call a universal bank.

54
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:40,040
So today, we are about 190,000 employees in a bit more than 80 countries coming back

55
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,440
to West Management.

56
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,480
So we are part, of course, from what we call the investment solution.

57
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,720
So that's a big division from the group.

58
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,480
But West Management, luckily for us, I should say, we are pretty small.

59
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:08,120
We are about 6,600 employees in 21 countries, managing a lot of assets, about 360 billion

60
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,200
asset under management, very efficient.

61
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:19,200
But what is very nice is that our size is pretty small, which allows us to behave as

62
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:25,480
a kind of startup inside a very big group that can be paralyzed.

63
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,480
Okay.

64
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,840
That's a big startup.

65
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,840
Yeah.

66
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
Sure.

67
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,680
But yeah, compared to the size of the enterprise.

68
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,680
Right.

69
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:43,680
And so certainly in an organization like BNP Paribus, there are lots of opportunities to

70
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:51,560
apply machine learning and artificial intelligence, how do you think about those various opportunities

71
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,600
and what does that landscape look like for you?

72
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:02,880
So as I like to say, first, the CDO is not for a chief digital officer, it's more for

73
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,000
a chief disruption officer.

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Kind of.

75
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Kind of correctly, right?

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yeah.

77
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,840
So I'm a gentle disruptor or a disruptive gentleman, nevertheless, my duty is really

78
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,880
to transform the company to support the different countries in that way for us management.

79
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:32,560
So looking to all the opportunities, artificial intelligence is at our side a very hot topic

80
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,520
on which we are working.

81
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:41,560
I would say it's a kind of old story, if I may say so, as for, for example, robot advisory

82
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,920
is a very well-known topic for financial and especially wealth management.

83
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:54,880
And we have already a robot advisory since almost three years now in place.

84
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,320
Even if we we provide the advice not directly to the clients, but to our relationship manager

85
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:09,560
because we are a human based, let's say, commercial approach, but that kind of topic exists

86
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:12,680
already since long at our side.

87
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:19,440
And it goes together with all the challenges that you could have on big data, not because

88
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,640
it's big, but because you have to analyze that amount of data.

89
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,920
And artificial intelligence is really something very important in that area.

90
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:37,800
And many more opportunities knowing that we strongly believe that voice will be the new

91
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,680
interface for the future.

92
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:47,320
And when you say voice, you need an LP, so natural language processing, you need a semantic

93
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:53,080
analysis, and all that is supported by artificial intelligence.

94
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,600
And finally, the world is changing is very challenging in terms of, let's say, profit

95
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:03,520
and the way we can manage the business.

96
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,360
So we have a very strong focus on being efficient.

97
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:19,520
And there you connect to the other topic, which is our APA, so the robotic process automation,

98
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,640
which is also related to artificial intelligence.

99
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:29,480
So there is a lot of things ongoing, a lot of opportunities on which we are today

100
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,480
working pretty hard.

101
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:40,960
You mentioned some of the long history of AI in general and even prior projects at the

102
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,800
bank.

103
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,920
What is it that makes AI hot right now for an organization like yours?

104
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:56,480
I mean, it's certainly, a lot of the technologies have been around for a while, and in fact, banks

105
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:05,840
in general have been early adopters of both machine learning and some of the types of technologies

106
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,760
we associate with AI today.

107
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:12,560
What do you think is, or do you think there's something different about what's happening

108
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,880
right now and what is that?

109
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,560
There are several factors, so regarding in the Paris-Barréne-Barréne-Barréne-Barréne-Barréne-Barréne-Barréne-Barréne management,

110
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:28,440
we have launched the digital transformations five years ago and to be very transparent

111
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,720
the first focus was really to build the foundations because yes, there is management,

112
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:23,360
it is there traditional, it's the same for us inside there in

113
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,680
five years ago. And to be very transparent, the first focus was really to build

114
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:37,360
the foundations because, yes, West Management is very traditional. That's the

115
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,480
same for us, since I'd be in Bebaba, meaning that as we have a very human-based

116
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,800
model, that made that digital was a bit far away. So it was really, the first

117
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,480
focus was really to build up good foundations, which are very classic. And once

118
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:04,640
those foundations were achieved, then we had the capacity to accelerate and really

119
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:13,080
let's say move into the more disruptive area that we could imagine by building

120
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:18,880
different factories in the countries. So today we have three factories, which

121
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,760
are really incubators and accelerators for us, allowing to work directly with

122
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:32,760
clients, build up some MVP, so minimum viable products that we can test in real

123
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,960
situation with clients. And then for the successful ones, move to what we call

124
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:44,040
the industrialization, so really to make the deployments from those new

125
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:51,840
services or solutions to all our clients. Having factories now, I know as to

126
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:59,520
really move forward into more, let's say, specific topics. And artificial

127
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,040
intelligence is one of them. Today we are, for example, working with the

128
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,640
factory that we have in Singapore, around the the classic chatbot that

129
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,080
supported by artificial intelligence, but also voice bots, because we have a

130
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,400
strong belief that we need relationship managers, but we want them to be

131
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:29,240
relationship managers 2.0. So augmented relationship managers. And for that, we

132
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:34,800
see a lot of opportunities in artificial intelligence to really increase their

133
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,720
capacity to be straight to the point, more accurate, get rid of some, let's say

134
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,040
administrative tasks where the added value is not there and give really to them

135
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,840
the capacity to better reply to clients, have more time to spend with their

136
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,120
clients, and take really all the most that we can offer in the other

137
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,920
relationship in terms of expertise, and really let's say the most important

138
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,400
discussion that they could have with their clients about their assets and

139
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,880
artificial intelligence, the opportunities we see is really to expand their

140
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,200
capacities. That's a very strong belief that we have. So these factories that

141
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:25,000
you're describing are digital factories, and it sounds like what's making,

142
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:32,080
sounds like a big part of what's making AI timely for you is that you're better

143
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:38,800
positioned to do something with it, right? The bank is built out capacity from

144
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:46,720
a digital perspective that positions it to take advantage of AI, and in a way

145
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:53,520
that it maybe wasn't able to do at least broadly years ago. Yeah, what has

146
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:00,640
changed really a lot with the factories is that we have now the capacity in the

147
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:07,800
way we manage your factories to work on business use case. So we are not looking

148
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:14,320
we are not an IT company, so more or less I should say I don't care about the

149
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:21,280
technology. I'm interested by the opportunities that we could have for the

150
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:26,800
clients to provide them added value, and by the way to do that we need some

151
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,720
technologies. So that's really the shift that we have. Digital is not any more

152
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:41,080
inside Ben-Bedariba, a kind of geek island where some strange people on

153
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,000
digital try to influence the way the business should be done. We have shift

154
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,160
that back really to business and when we take initiative in a factory, first

155
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:59,400
we do that in the startup mode with a lot of co-design and pure

156
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:06,400
iGiStream approach. The product owner is an expert from the business coming

157
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:12,200
for his expertise and we are able to help him in terms of methodology and so on,

158
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:18,520
but he's really focusing on the clients and the way to provide added value.

159
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:25,760
So that's really a big shift because it allows really to experiment new

160
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:32,960
approach, new way of working and new ideas, really connected to clients because

161
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:39,640
we have clients that work with us inside the factories from the very initial

162
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:48,640
IED concept until the MVP and tests really in production, real situation with real

163
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:55,120
clients and then failure suddenly becomes an option. So we have now the

164
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:01,760
capacity to really take a subject, try to find the best way to address. If it's

165
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,160
not working, okay, we find another way, we change the technology, we change the

166
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:13,440
startup with which we are working or we change the concept itself and we

167
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:20,880
can adapt a lot. Artificial intelligence is, as I will explain at the summit

168
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:28,160
beginning of December, is really an unknown area. We know that there are a lot

169
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,240
of opportunities but it's very difficult to really see what will be the real

170
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:41,080
complexity to have that. What are really the added value for the customers and

171
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:49,440
of course for the bank. So being able to experiment that very quickly while not

172
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,240
having a prototype disconnected from the real life but reaching really a product

173
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,640
that we can test is, yeah, it's key. If you want really to explore artificial

174
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:09,840
intelligence, do you find that there are any ways in which AI has required you to

175
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:19,320
evolve your factory model or your your agile methodologies MVP approach. So far

176
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:25,960
the the way we work inside the the factory is really perfect for artificial

177
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:33,320
intelligence. So today for, for example, working on the voice bot to expand the

178
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,600
capacities from the relationship managers. We do that with a very short

179
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,240
sprint or short cycle, delivering something that we we can test, evaluate,

180
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,680
adapt and then move to the next step. And that in a very fast approach, so it's

181
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:58,480
when we we work on MVP, usually it's it's about four months to really deliver

182
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:06,360
something that we can put into the hands of our customers. And the capacity

183
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,960
that we have to adapt constantly is the best approach in terms of discovering

184
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:19,000
something pretty new as artificial intelligence, especially when it comes to

185
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:28,240
an LP semantic analysis, which are really for us new technologies, new ways of

186
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,840
thinking. And having that faculty to really adapt all the time is crucial. Can

187
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,720
you tell us a little bit about the chatbot and voice bot projects that you've

188
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:45,880
launched. So the story started in June this year with the International

189
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,800
Hackathon, which is organized by the Paribag group. And in which West Management

190
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:57,920
is very active. Yeah, so we have participated to the the hackathon in seven

191
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:03,800
countries for West Management. So meaning having a real West Management challenge

192
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:10,440
to address. And the challenge at the start for Singapore was chatbot,

193
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,160
globally speaking. But during the weekend of the hackathon, and I had a pleasure

194
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:23,680
to spend 48 hours really on the floor with the startups, because of all the

195
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:30,400
discussions and so on, there had been one startup who moved from the pure

196
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:38,240
classic chatbot approach to the voice bots and having the ideas to have to

197
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,840
hook man the capacity from the relationship manager. And they will, they

198
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:48,480
want the one, sorry, the hackathon session in Singapore. Because of that, we

199
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,200
took them and then okay, when someone wins with West Management in the hackathon,

200
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,480
it's because we want to do something right after. So come with us in the

201
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:06,560
factory work with us. And we want to reach the MVP with you. And by the way,

202
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,680
it's the first of December. It's at what we call the demo days. So it's the big

203
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:18,400
final of the international hackathon. It could be in Paris. We truly hope that

204
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,840
our startup from Singapore will be a winner in that final date where all the

205
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:31,880
startups from all around the world will compete for a final price. Okay, okay.

206
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:36,960
Can you give me a little bit more detail about what, what do you mean when you

207
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,800
save voice bot? What is the envision functionality of this voice bot? I will

208
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:50,800
show the pitch from the startup at the summit. But to summarize, it's really in

209
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:55,920
real-time conversation between the clients and the relationship manager. The

210
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:02,280
conversation would be listened through NLB. It will be processed. We will

211
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:09,520
detect the intense of the clients. Compute a reply. Not a reply that we will

212
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,480
give to the clients, but a reply that will be displayed on the workstation of

213
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:22,160
their relationship manager to guide in directly. So if the client says, I need to

214
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:30,040
do a transfer. If I simplify on the screen in real-time, there will be, let's say,

215
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:35,440
the summary of the transaction requests and the button for the relationship

216
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,440
manager to execute. If the client is asking questions around a product or

217
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:49,600
something very specific in terms of assets, we will find a reply and give all

218
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,680
the information elements directly to the relationship manager. So, and of

219
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:02,040
course, when you are doing transaction remotely with clients, we have to

220
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:08,440
follow many rules for the regulators and the legal context and the

221
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:13,720
discussion will be listened and let's say highlights and guidance will be

222
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,000
provided to the relationship manager in real-time again on the screen. So pay

223
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,320
attention to that. You forgot to say that and so on, so to be sure that

224
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:29,320
everything goes very smoothly. And behind, with the capacity to execute what is

225
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:35,440
agreed during the conversation. Okay, that's very interesting. I recently

226
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:43,000
attended an event in New York that NYU Future Labs AI Summit. NYU Future

227
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,280
Labs is a, they've got an accelerator program called AI Nexus Lab that's

228
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:54,080
incubates AI startups and one of the startups and I actually did a podcast with

229
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,400
them that was went out a few weeks ago or so a couple of weeks ago. There's a

230
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,200
company called Second Mind and I think they're doing just what you're

231
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,160
describing. They, you kind of transient listening to a conversation and then

232
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,480
it's almost like the old screen pop from a, you know, a call center type of

233
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,080
workstation where it's, in their case, the demo that they showed, you know, you

234
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,320
could be talking about, you could talk about general topics and it would push

235
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:29,280
the agent, you know, Wikipedia articles or directions, Google maps, things

236
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,600
like that. But, you know, there, I think the market that they're going after is

237
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,360
just the one that you're describing with this voice spot where you would be

238
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,840
tying it into business systems and really, I guess what I'm interpreting

239
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:49,680
here is kind of the next evolution of almost call center, you know, software that

240
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:54,800
is kind of guiding someone through a conversation, but here you're trying to

241
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:00,120
kind of augment the resources that they have it, or augment their ability to

242
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:04,400
access, you know, a broad set of resources, you know, while still trying to help

243
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,720
them kind of guide the conversation towards some set of goals. Yeah, exactly, and

244
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,440
at the same time, as we display information to the relationship manager, the way

245
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,560
he will use them will give the feedback group to the artificial intelligence,

246
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:29,320
and the system must become more and more accurate, and there's really the

247
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:33,920
feedback group to enrich the system. So it's pretty powerful. How do you think

248
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:39,360
this changes the relationship between those relationship managers and their

249
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:45,240
clients or more broadly the bank and the clients? So again, our objective is

250
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:51,280
really to deliver the best quality to the clients, the best added value to the

251
00:23:51,280 --> 00:24:00,160
accrued shop on the request it could have, and so on very fast. So many topics

252
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:07,640
to be addressed. So basically the relation between the client and his relationship

253
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:14,960
manager will not change. So they will still discuss and so on. It's just that we

254
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,360
will have a relationship manager to be faster, more accurate, have a broad

255
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,160
vision on everything that could influence his discussion with the client. He has

256
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:33,280
right now on the phone without any preparation. So that's really what is

257
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,840
very interesting in that area with artificial intelligence. What have been some

258
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:44,680
of the, what can you describe, some of the technology involved in the way you've

259
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:48,720
implemented this and maybe some of the challenges that you've run into? I

260
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:56,160
must say that NLB is the door to door for us. Let's say Kias said that we need, I've

261
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:01,360
been really impressed by the start of the Winstead Yakuton session Singapore

262
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:08,480
because they have developed their own NLB processing. And I must say that I've

263
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:15,440
been amazed by the accuracy that they can reach the capacity of learning from

264
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,360
the system to adapt to the different accent, different languages, and really

265
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,840
their capacity to in final, they say have a kind of personal NLP

266
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:36,240
client. So as you can hear, I'm not English native. So I have an accent which

267
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,000
of course could impact the way the artificial intelligence can understand me

268
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,240
when I'm speaking. And the way they manage that, they can really adapt the

269
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,400
understanding really on the very personal base. So they will even a real

270
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,200
French with a heavy French accent in English, will still be understood by the

271
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,080
system. So that's really something very important

272
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:11,440
because we need accuracy to detect the intents from the clients and then the

273
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,200
artificial intelligence part who pays from the intent find the best

274
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:23,040
reply to display to the relationship manager and have the learning capacity

275
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:30,000
with the feedback is the final, let's say a module that we need.

276
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,280
And behind that's all the topics to get access to all the data that we have

277
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:41,120
inside the bank to really take the most because artificial intelligence

278
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,480
without perfect input is kind of empty brain. You have to

279
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:55,440
to feed that and data is really crucial. Luckily, as a bank, we have a lot of

280
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,960
data to share with that. So we can really put a lot inside the brain.

281
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,560
And then it's a question to, let's say, to make the way of thinking,

282
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,760
really fitting the targets we are following.

283
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:15,200
When you describe this startup in Singapore, is this an internal

284
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:21,200
startup that I envision this as an internal hackathon and this

285
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,720
startup were bank employees or is it an external startup company?

286
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:33,040
No, it was a real hackathon with external startups with a set of

287
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:41,200
startups which were from the very young startups to the ones which are already

288
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,200
known on the market and more mature. So it was a full-fledged hackathon.

289
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,840
Oh, got it, got it. And is this what's this startup called?

290
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,600
So it's a Korean startup named Kudadjust, very young startup,

291
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,600
very promising. Okay. And do you have a sense for

292
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,120
some of the technologies, you know, the technology decisions that they've had

293
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,320
to make and building out this platform? And, you know, maybe some,

294
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,320
you know, I guess one of the questions that comes up frequently for me

295
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,280
in talking about chat bots and voice bots and the like is whether they're

296
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,200
building on top of some existing, you know, third-party

297
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,280
software or whether they've built it all from scratch and what some of the

298
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:36,560
trade-offs there are. Kudadjust is a mix. So they have developed their own

299
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:42,480
NLP and their own artificial intelligence engine. And then they extend

300
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,440
some of the capacities by using, let's say, other solutions.

301
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,000
I'm really sorry, I could not name those solutions because it's really

302
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,960
added the periphery from that. But they are really, they their own

303
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,360
their own technology. That makes them pretty interesting.

304
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,520
If, yeah, perhaps I should not say that, but if our topic was to make

305
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,640
Alexa like all the others, it's still interesting, of course.

306
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,440
Nevertheless, it's like the others. And we have a strong belief that there are

307
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,200
opportunities to really be different on the market for

308
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,280
wealth management at the best, of course, for the clients, but

309
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,960
really to take the most from those opportunities

310
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:38,000
is not by copying what everyone is doing or at least not all the time.

311
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:45,440
In that area, to explore at best, yeah, we don't have to to follow all the time

312
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,120
what the others are doing. Right. Are there other

313
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,640
opportunities on your roadmap that you can speak to and how you

314
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,000
further apply AI to wealth management? Yeah, I can also speak about

315
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,680
big data. So not on, let's say, how to manage big data with

316
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:10,720
that do for other technologies, but really how to take the most from all those

317
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,200
information in the best way. And on that, we have again, with a startup

318
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,200
this time in Paris, we have worked on a proof of concept and we are now working

319
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:30,480
on the MVP itself to really use capacity based on artificial intelligence,

320
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,960
which supports the way that the data scientists and

321
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:41,760
data analysts or classical ones are exploring the data to find the path

322
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:48,080
they are looking for. For example, to detect a based on model that

323
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,640
we can after apply to many clients, why that client is more interested in

324
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,400
advisory while another is more execution only or any other question that we

325
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:06,080
can have, hot topics like attrition, client retention,

326
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,600
to really dig into the data in a very deep manner.

327
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,800
Unit tools and artificial intelligence is really a very interesting area to

328
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,920
support that. Okay. And what's that company? So that one

329
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:28,640
was a DreamCraft. It's more about the neural all approach on the data

330
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:34,160
to connect all the different topics that you could export to to find

331
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:39,360
really the common bad about specific behavior that you would like to

332
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,560
analyze. And you said what kind of approach?

333
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:49,600
No, no. Is it French? French, perhaps? No, it's

334
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,320
Neuron? Neuron? Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry.

335
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,200
No, no, no, no, French. I wouldn't want to have to do the

336
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,680
the entire interview in French. So

337
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:11,840
Okay, so they're helping, they've got some technology that you can apply to,

338
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,280
it sounds like the, you know, your various data lakes and

339
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,920
and big data repositories that helps you better kind of understand

340
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,440
that uses AI to help you better understand what

341
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,560
information assets are within those environments and

342
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:34,880
maybe help you understand how to best use them. Yeah, that's the idea.

343
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,760
So the way they manage that as well, they are not on the

344
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:44,320
let's say the data lake and big data technology itself. It's really the way

345
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,840
they analyze the data and the way they translate that into

346
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:56,160
let's say factors and items that can be understood by

347
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:01,200
common marketers. Right. I hope that there will be not too many

348
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,040
marketers listen to me because they will hate me, but yeah,

349
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:10,560
data can be so complex that you have really to find a way to

350
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:16,640
represent that clearly. So what are the main factors which

351
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,280
influence the results and that part is based on the artificial

352
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:25,920
intelligence inside Dreamcork and it's pretty efficient so

353
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,200
it's very interesting to explore. Okay, it sounds like a really

354
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,400
interesting area in the early days of data lakes. There was a lot

355
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:42,480
of a lot of the effort went into like trying to manually create

356
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,640
these data catalogs that would help a marketer or a line of

357
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,400
business person understand what data is available to them. But

358
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:58,080
there's just so much data. It seems like applying AI to that

359
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,440
problem of keeping that data catalog up to date and even

360
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,080
automatically making recommending insights that could come

361
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,080
from the data that you have is an interesting opportunity

362
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,280
for a large organization. Yeah, exactly. And also,

363
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,880
surprisingly, you also learn about the quality of your data.

364
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,560
But it's a different story. We have been very surprised that

365
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,760
for some exploration, we made one of the main factor was

366
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,560
being male or female, which was on that topic totally

367
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,760
kind of nonsense. Yeah, yeah. And in fact, we have seen that

368
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,200
there was a mistake somewhere and in fact for many many

369
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,600
clients, we did not have the information if it was a

370
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,600
madam or a sir and so on. And then so we we have corrected that.

371
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:04,000
So we have, of course, the information in one of our system,

372
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,560
but the way the data lake was feed, there was a mistake and

373
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:13,120
that information was sometimes lost. So we improved the

374
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:17,520
quality of the data lake by working with the solution.

375
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,960
So was the just to make sure I understand the issue here was

376
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:28,080
the issue that gender was in fact very predictive, but you

377
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:34,720
didn't have that data for a lot of your records or that you

378
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,200
you ran some analysis and found that gender, you know, was

379
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,080
predictive, but it really shouldn't have been. And it was,

380
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,240
you know, there was really something else going on that you

381
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:48,480
had to identify. Exactly. It's a the the fact that the

382
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,760
gender was a was very important in the result was just a

383
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,720
nonsense. Yeah. And so what was the underlying issue?

384
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,360
Was it was gender correlated with something else that,

385
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,120
you know, or was, you know, just something very very broken in

386
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:10,880
the process. So it was broken in the process so that that's

387
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,240
the reason why I meant that equality. Because in fact, let's say

388
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,600
we had a kind of bug in the process to feed the data lake,

389
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,800
which made that for many clients, the gender was not

390
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,360
filled in fact. So it was in the, let's say, the the main

391
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,040
systems, but when we take the data to put that in the data lake

392
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,200
something happened that the gender was just disappearing

393
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,320
for 40% of the clients. Oh, wow. Okay. So based on that, we

394
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,560
we have found that that issue we have corrected it of

395
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:55,040
groups. And then the model made more sense because suddenly

396
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:00,000
gender was not a factor anymore. Okay, make sense.

397
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,840
Well, Terry, can you maybe help us wind things up? Do you have any

398
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,560
advice that you give to that you'd give to other, you know,

399
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,640
either, you know, CDOs at other organizations that are trying

400
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:21,200
to figure out how to fit AI into their portfolio or perhaps even

401
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,880
to, you know, companies that want to work with organizations

402
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,880
like yours in terms of, you know, the types of things you need

403
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,640
or things you're looking for. If I have some some advice,

404
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,520
it's really to focus on the use case. Always great advice.

405
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,520
Yes, really do not start with the technology business will must be

406
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:48,320
really in the driving seat based on a business use case to

407
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,520
achieve. Otherwise, you will, you will be lost in the topic.

408
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,920
It's too wide. It's too complex. It's very often too new.

409
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,240
So it must be very pragmatic. I want to achieve that in terms of

410
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,400
business. And then just in brackets, just a question to find the right

411
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,960
technology or the right partners to drive there. Second advice,

412
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,960
if you are not working on artificial intelligence, well,

413
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,400
you should, because yeah, especially for the banks, but for many

414
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,640
other companies, there is a strong war against cost to be more

415
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,120
efficient, more accurate, deliver the best quality,

416
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,520
at the best price and so on. So yeah, artificial intelligence

417
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,400
is a for sure part of the reply. So you have to work on that.

418
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,440
It's about your future for your company and all the business that you could

419
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:54,320
do for sure. And I think, yeah, that's my two best advice I could give.

420
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,760
Now, perhaps the third one, yeah, baby steps. Don't try to put

421
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,680
artificial intelligence for the whole company in one's experiments

422
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,040
learn, because there is a lot to learn. And artificial intelligence

423
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:16,720
area is totally different from what you usually manage in terms of technologies.

424
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:23,360
So the best approach is really to try, fail, try again, adapt and so on.

425
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:28,880
So experiment is, yeah, one of the best advice I can give also.

426
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,680
Great. Well, Terry, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with me.

427

I really appreciate it. And you know, I've learned a ton about what you're

428
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,720
up to and it's some really interesting stuff. So thank you.

429
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:49,040
