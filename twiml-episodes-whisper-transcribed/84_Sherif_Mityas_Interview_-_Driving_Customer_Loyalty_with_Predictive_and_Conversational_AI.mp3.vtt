00:00.000 --> 00:15.920
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

00:15.920 --> 00:20.920
people doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.520
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.640
This week on the podcast features a series of conversations with speakers from the AI Summit

00:28.640 --> 00:29.920
in New York City.

00:29.920 --> 00:35.200
The theme of that conference and this series is AI in the Enterprise and I think you'll

00:35.200 --> 00:41.240
find a really interesting mix of both technical and case study oriented discussions this week.

00:41.240 --> 00:46.360
Please note that on Wednesday December 13th we'll be holding our last Twimble online

00:46.360 --> 00:48.360
meet-up of the year.

00:48.360 --> 00:52.520
Bring your thoughts on the top machine learning and AI stories of 2017 for our discussion

00:52.520 --> 00:58.620
segment and for our main presentation Bruno GonzÃ¡lez will be discussing the paper, understand

00:58.620 --> 01:05.220
and deep learning requires rethinking generalization by Shi Yuan Zhang from MIT and Google Brain and

01:05.220 --> 01:06.300
others.

01:06.300 --> 01:11.340
You can find more details and register at twimbleai.com slash meet-up.

01:11.340 --> 01:17.180
To close out our AI Summit New York series I speak with Sharif Mietius, head of technology,

01:17.180 --> 01:22.940
digital and strategy at restaurant chain TGI Fridays.

01:22.940 --> 01:28.340
Sharif joins us to discuss how Fridays is utilizing conversational AI to enhance customer

01:28.340 --> 01:30.180
loyalty.

01:30.180 --> 01:34.620
Sharif wants Fridays to be known as a tech company that happens to sell burgers and beer

01:34.620 --> 01:38.980
and in this conversation we get an in-depth look at the technology landscape they've

01:38.980 --> 01:42.260
put in place to move the company in that direction.

01:42.260 --> 01:46.300
Sharif also shares some of the things on the horizon for Fridays as well as some of

01:46.300 --> 01:48.380
what they've learned along the way.

01:48.380 --> 01:52.900
Be sure to share your feedback or questions on the show notes page which you'll find at

01:52.900 --> 01:57.220

02:42.820 --> 02:45.500
And now on to the show.

02:45.500 --> 02:55.700
Alright everyone, I am on the line with Sharif Mityas.

02:55.700 --> 03:00.820
Sharif is CIO and Vice President of Strategy with TDI Fridays.

03:00.820 --> 03:04.060
Sharif, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

03:04.060 --> 03:05.060
Thank you.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.060
Pleasure to be here.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.060
Absolutely.

03:07.060 --> 03:10.340
Why don't we get started by having you tell us a little bit about your background and

03:10.340 --> 03:13.740
how you came to get involved in AI?

03:13.740 --> 03:16.980
Yeah, well it's been a securitus route.

03:16.980 --> 03:24.460
I started my career actually in consulting, worked with a number of Fortune 500 retailers,

03:24.460 --> 03:32.740
restaurant brands, consumer products organizations, and really through my career helping organizations

03:32.740 --> 03:39.780
think about kind of really innovation, talking about how do we create, how do we evolve and

03:39.780 --> 03:45.740
really drive innovation from an organizational perspective to allow us to better meet really

03:45.740 --> 03:51.420
the end-state goals, whether that is drive revenue, reduce cost, greater guest engagement,

03:51.420 --> 03:57.340
and really as the underpinnings of that throughout my career has been technology.

03:57.340 --> 04:02.620
Technology enables us to do different things, to do things that allows us to look at things

04:02.620 --> 04:04.860
differently really at scale.

04:04.860 --> 04:11.220
And for very large organizations being able to do things at an individual or customer level

04:11.220 --> 04:16.780
is really enabled by technology, you'll never have enough bodies, so to speak, to be able

04:16.780 --> 04:22.220
to target individual guests without the use of technology and so as my career continued

04:22.220 --> 04:27.380
to evolve, continued to rely and really utilize technology to drive innovation.

04:27.380 --> 04:34.620
And now in my current role, really driving kind of the question of what's next for restaurants,

04:34.620 --> 04:40.740
what's next for engaging guests both inside our four walls as well as outside and really

04:40.740 --> 04:51.460
utilizing the power now of AI and chatbots and the new technologies to create a different

04:51.460 --> 04:57.220
level of guest engagement, to really create more intimacy and that one-to-one connection

04:57.220 --> 04:59.700
that every brand strives to have.

04:59.700 --> 05:05.300
We go back to the first TGI Fridays over 50 years ago, was that first bar and grill

05:05.300 --> 05:12.460
in New York where the bartender connected one-on-one with that guest and coming back now 50

05:12.460 --> 05:19.460
plus years later when we serve over 500,000 guests per day across our network globally, how

05:19.460 --> 05:24.740
do we go back to connecting with those individuals on a one-to-one basis?

05:24.740 --> 05:26.660
AI allows us to do that.

05:26.660 --> 05:33.300
Can you elaborate on how if you think about it at face value, maybe you think about it

05:33.300 --> 05:39.140
in the opposite way, right, that AI kind of gets in between human-to-human connections?

05:39.140 --> 05:41.060
How are you saying how are you looking at it?

05:41.060 --> 05:43.300
Yeah, so we're looking at really in two ways.

05:43.300 --> 05:49.740
I mean, the old adage of, you know, help me be better and don't hinder, right?

05:49.740 --> 05:54.300
So from a do-no-harm is kind of the physicians adage.

05:54.300 --> 05:59.580
And so when we think about AI and really specifically technology, it's how does it make

05:59.580 --> 06:00.580
our people better?

06:00.580 --> 06:03.540
How does it make our team members in the restaurants better?

06:03.540 --> 06:08.220
How does it make us better from a corporate perspective and in really in two ways?

06:08.220 --> 06:14.780
So, you know, from a, when our guests are outside our restaurants, they're on social platforms,

06:14.780 --> 06:20.060
they're talking to voices, sister devices, they're doing things on a daily basis, whether

06:20.060 --> 06:26.940
mobility or, you know, sitting behind a desk, that drives engagement, that they want to

06:26.940 --> 06:27.940
be engaged, right?

06:27.940 --> 06:31.620
They want to talk to their friends, they want to understand what's happening, they want

06:31.620 --> 06:33.620
to share things.

06:33.620 --> 06:37.700
And we use AI to be part of that conversation.

06:37.700 --> 06:42.860
So through our chatbots, for example, we use AI to listen.

06:42.860 --> 06:46.180
We understand when people are talking about certain drinks.

06:46.180 --> 06:49.740
We understand when it's a hot day in New York and they're talking about long island ice

06:49.740 --> 06:51.060
teas.

06:51.060 --> 06:57.900
And so we use AI to capture first information and then to suggest the next best action,

06:57.900 --> 06:58.900
right?

06:58.900 --> 07:02.340
So for that individual guest who's thinking about that old adage, you know, kind of, what

07:02.340 --> 07:03.340
do I do tonight?

07:03.340 --> 07:05.980
You know, what are we, what are we going to do tonight?

07:05.980 --> 07:07.380
Where are we going to go?

07:07.380 --> 07:13.180
Being part of their daily kind of interaction with their friends on the social platforms,

07:13.180 --> 07:19.900
utilizing AI to come up with that, well, send this individual, this specific content at

07:19.900 --> 07:25.660
this specific time on this specific platform is really powerful.

07:25.660 --> 07:30.940
So being able to connect with individuals using technology allows the people that our

07:30.940 --> 07:36.780
social media team, for example, to have higher level conversations, they know more about

07:36.780 --> 07:37.780
these guests.

07:37.780 --> 07:42.700
They're using AI to be smarter in how they respond in certain cases.

07:42.700 --> 07:48.660
So we have the bots respond, but we also have humans still respond and it makes them better.

07:48.660 --> 07:52.700
Similarly inside our restaurants, we have loyalty members, for example.

07:52.700 --> 08:01.900
And so if I can tell the host or hostess through AI that a loyalty member is in the bar,

08:01.900 --> 08:05.820
and this is what they've had before, this is their favorite drink, this is how they like

08:05.820 --> 08:07.700
to engage.

08:07.700 --> 08:13.580
Imagine how much more powerful that information is for a bartender or a host or a server

08:13.580 --> 08:17.260
knowing who that individual guest is and we make them better.

08:17.260 --> 08:22.140
We create a better experience for the guest because we know who you are and we provide

08:22.140 --> 08:27.460
that information through the technology to our servers inside the restaurant.

08:27.460 --> 08:33.500
In that latter scenario, where does AI come in relative to traditional loyalty types

08:33.500 --> 08:36.980
of technology is like a CRM system?

08:36.980 --> 08:43.580
Yeah, so what we do is the data, the CRM, the guest profile information, it sits behind

08:43.580 --> 08:50.900
the scenes, but AI then says, okay, I know not only who this person is, but given what

08:50.900 --> 08:58.340
others have done, what other actions people have taken, I suggest you offer X. I suggest

08:58.340 --> 09:05.980
that we surprise and delight this guest because we can show a return on offering whatever

09:05.980 --> 09:13.140
it is that second drink we can offer something suggestive that we feed to our servers or bartenders

09:13.140 --> 09:18.820
to be able to kind of again deliver the next best action as it relates to our guest.

09:18.820 --> 09:23.700
So it's beyond predictive, it's really around what are some of the different options that

09:23.700 --> 09:29.940
the machine is telling us should work to help either drive loyalty, increase frequency

09:29.940 --> 09:32.460
or drive the check average higher.

09:32.460 --> 09:39.220
So your initial efforts in this space have been focused on chatbots both outside the

09:39.220 --> 09:47.660
store and in the store, taking a step back, how did you think about the space of AI and

09:47.660 --> 09:53.380
the opportunity presented by AI as a whole and determine where to start?

09:53.380 --> 09:54.700
Yeah, that's a great question.

09:54.700 --> 10:01.540
So we kind of started, and again, I'll profess, we are still in the crawl of the crawl walk

10:01.540 --> 10:02.540
run.

10:02.540 --> 10:03.540
I think we all are.

10:03.540 --> 10:04.540
Yeah.

10:04.540 --> 10:08.580
And this sector is, this technology is really, I think we're just starting to scratch

10:08.580 --> 10:09.580
the service.

10:09.580 --> 10:12.580
So when we step back, we obviously did the first thing, which is we just talked to a lot

10:12.580 --> 10:17.140
of people, you know, the old, you know, I'm a big proponent of, don't be the smartest

10:17.140 --> 10:18.380
person in the room.

10:18.380 --> 10:22.260
And so we reached out to a lot of folks, we reached out to a lot of different third parties

10:22.260 --> 10:26.660
and partners and just started understanding, understanding what are the use cases out

10:26.660 --> 10:27.660
there?

10:27.660 --> 10:28.660
Right?

10:28.660 --> 10:30.460
What are what are other people at least exploring?

10:30.460 --> 10:33.340
Whether that be, and we heard a lot about customer service, right?

10:33.340 --> 10:38.140
So we talked a lot of folks that were using AI in their, in their help desks and their,

10:38.140 --> 10:41.340
you know, customer service, you know, call centers.

10:41.340 --> 10:42.340
And that was interesting.

10:42.340 --> 10:46.380
And we obviously have our own call center and people call 1-800 Fridays.

10:46.380 --> 10:49.900
So we felt that was, you know, interesting, but too far removed, right?

10:49.900 --> 10:55.940
We were, we were wanting to use AI more around that first interaction or that kind of very

10:55.940 --> 11:03.460
user kind of guest facing activity that, again, is understanding how they think about considering

11:03.460 --> 11:07.660
where they're going to go tonight for a food or a beverage occasion.

11:07.660 --> 11:11.820
So instead of kind of what I would consider kind of the, the back end when, when someone

11:11.820 --> 11:16.300
wants to call you and ask a question, I wanted to get out in front of it.

11:16.300 --> 11:21.860
And be more kind of using AI to really understand the voice of the customer and to be able to

11:21.860 --> 11:27.900
respond with more relevant and more personalized content.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.740
So that's what really started the path on.

11:29.740 --> 11:30.740
So how do we do that?

11:30.740 --> 11:35.580
And so we started from a guest first perspective that said, well, where are our guests when

11:35.580 --> 11:38.580
they're not with us, where, where are they and what are they doing?

11:38.580 --> 11:42.460
Obviously, they're on social, obviously, they're talking to things, they're, they're typing

11:42.460 --> 11:43.460
things.

11:43.460 --> 11:48.620
We started our journey by understanding where they are and then start, and then ask questions

11:48.620 --> 11:51.580
on what do we want AI to solve, right?

11:51.580 --> 11:57.940
So we went back to some of the KPIs and said, well, from a, from a metrics perspective,

11:57.940 --> 12:02.420
we're after, you know, loyalty, we want, we want loyal guests.

12:02.420 --> 12:04.500
We want them to come in more often, right?

12:04.500 --> 12:09.820
So from a frequency perspective, and we want them to spend more when they're with us,

12:09.820 --> 12:15.420
whether they're dining inside a restaurant or picking up an order to go or delivered.

12:15.420 --> 12:18.580
And so if you start with those questions, then you, then you kind of work backwards and

12:18.580 --> 12:20.900
say, well, how can AI help that?

12:20.900 --> 12:23.060
Well, first we need to understand, right?

12:23.060 --> 12:28.100
So to me, the first thing that AI really before we got into God into AI is we had to, we

12:28.100 --> 12:31.060
had to, we had to listen, we had to collect data.

12:31.060 --> 12:32.740
And that led us to chatbots, right?

12:32.740 --> 12:38.620
Because chatbots are not only just delivery mechanisms, they're listening mechanisms as well.

12:38.620 --> 12:42.460
They help you understand what people are talking about, what questions, what dialogues they're

12:42.460 --> 12:45.140
having as it relates to the brand.

12:45.140 --> 12:47.100
Then we had to connect the dots.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.580
So then we used some other third parties to say, okay, I've got purchase behavior.

12:50.580 --> 12:51.580
I know what people buy.

12:51.580 --> 12:52.820
I know when they buy it.

12:52.820 --> 12:55.940
I know I know where they are when they buy it.

12:55.940 --> 13:00.260
And then I have all these interactions that are happening on social platforms and voice

13:00.260 --> 13:01.740
enabled devices.

13:01.740 --> 13:06.620
I also have kind of information when they call or one 800 Fridays call centers.

13:06.620 --> 13:11.580
I know credit card data, I know four square data, I know all this data.

13:11.580 --> 13:16.940
But now I need someone, I need something to stitch it together and help me understand

13:16.940 --> 13:18.540
what to do with it, right?

13:18.540 --> 13:20.420
Kind of what, what do I do with this?

13:20.420 --> 13:26.100
How do I pull the insights and create that next best action for my guest?

13:26.100 --> 13:28.140
And that's kind of the path we took.

13:28.140 --> 13:34.340
I imagine a big part of the challenge in approaching these various AI projects has been

13:34.340 --> 13:39.860
in that latter piece that you made sounds so easy with connecting the dots, right?

13:39.860 --> 13:44.460
Can you elaborate on some of what went into making all that happen?

13:44.460 --> 13:45.460
Yeah.

13:45.460 --> 13:49.420
So again, it goes back to not being the smartest people in the room.

13:49.420 --> 13:55.940
We partnered with kind of a very early stage startup out of Seattle that really helped

13:55.940 --> 14:01.820
us pull all this structured and unstructured data together and started creating not just

14:01.820 --> 14:08.020
micro segments, but really the opportunity to differentiate, you know, Sally versus Mary.

14:08.020 --> 14:13.260
And we ran a bunch of pilots, as you can imagine, to, you know, really start holding in

14:13.260 --> 14:15.580
on, well, do we really know Sally?

14:15.580 --> 14:19.380
And then I know someone that looks like Sally, but she's slightly different.

14:19.380 --> 14:21.220
So I don't know her name yet.

14:21.220 --> 14:26.780
So let's call her Sally B and Sally C. And so we started kind of really, again, creating

14:26.780 --> 14:34.700
many personas of individual guests and this, this, this tool really helps us, again, literally

14:34.700 --> 14:39.500
I use the vernacular and they use it before I even met them, connect the dots.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.780
Because they're, everyone swims in data.

14:41.780 --> 14:46.340
It's this opportunity to really pull it together and say, this is Sally and Sally need something

14:46.340 --> 14:51.220
different than Mary, even though they'd be in that same demographic, psychographic, geographic

14:51.220 --> 14:52.220
bucket.

14:52.220 --> 14:55.380
They are two totally different individuals.

14:55.380 --> 14:57.940
And our first pilot was crazy.

14:57.940 --> 15:03.100
I mean, we, we did this where we just took a group of people that we had identified their

15:03.100 --> 15:06.220
individual personas was about 10,000 people.

15:06.220 --> 15:07.940
How are those 10,000 selected?

15:07.940 --> 15:12.100
We basically just because we, we, we believed we knew a lot about them through this, this

15:12.100 --> 15:14.260
data stitching activity.

15:14.260 --> 15:15.900
They weren't loyalty members, right?

15:15.900 --> 15:18.900
So we didn't, we didn't have them already in our database.

15:18.900 --> 15:25.060
These were just individual guests that we had been able to pull from there, again,

15:25.060 --> 15:29.660
gastrointactivity, their online activity, their social activity, et cetera.

15:29.660 --> 15:32.380
And we sent them a message.

15:32.380 --> 15:37.020
We sent them a message on whatever platform they happened to be on if they had given

15:37.020 --> 15:38.020
us permission.

15:38.020 --> 15:42.260
So they had obviously interacted with us somehow in the past, but they weren't loyalty members.

15:42.260 --> 15:47.660
We sent them a message, non, a non-discount message that was just relevant to them.

15:47.660 --> 15:55.940
So for instance, Mary, we knew, liked for whatever reason, she drank wine on Tuesday nights.

15:55.940 --> 15:58.060
And she always had a girl's night on Tuesday nights.

15:58.060 --> 16:02.500
So we figured it might be some book club, might be something that was encouraging Mary to

16:02.500 --> 16:04.460
have wine on Tuesday nights.

16:04.460 --> 16:05.460
Okay.

16:05.460 --> 16:11.020
So we sent a message to Mary about a wine special just for her on Tuesday night at her local

16:11.020 --> 16:12.020
Fridays.

16:12.020 --> 16:17.340
And you said that's not, it wasn't discount, it wasn't a discounted promotion.

16:17.340 --> 16:18.900
It was some other kind of special.

16:18.900 --> 16:22.940
It was just a special like we have this new wine at our restaurant.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.300
We'd like you to come try it.

16:24.300 --> 16:28.660
And we sent it to her Tuesday at 5 p.m., right?

16:28.660 --> 16:34.020
So right before we knew she was about to go out, well, each person of this 10,000 had

16:34.020 --> 16:36.100
a different message like that.

16:36.100 --> 16:40.660
We had a 78% click-through rate.

16:40.660 --> 16:47.860
And then out of that 78%, we tracked half of that group actually ordered something that

16:47.860 --> 16:51.420
we could tell, because we knew that we were able to track them.

16:51.420 --> 16:52.420
Some people we couldn't track.

16:52.420 --> 16:56.180
So they may have ordered, but they used cash or something we didn't know.

16:56.180 --> 17:01.260
Without a discount, we drove purchase of one third of that group.

17:01.260 --> 17:08.740
And so it was the power again of a very personalized message at the right time that was powered

17:08.740 --> 17:12.580
basically by this AI tool that we had partnered with.

17:12.580 --> 17:14.020
And what was that company?

17:14.020 --> 17:15.500
They're called Imperity.

17:15.500 --> 17:16.500
Imperity?

17:16.500 --> 17:17.500
Yep.

17:17.500 --> 17:22.500
And is that something where, is that like a cloud service of some sort, or is it software

17:22.500 --> 17:26.420
that you're running or more service that they delivered?

17:26.420 --> 17:27.820
It's a service they deliver.

17:27.820 --> 17:28.820
Okay.

17:28.820 --> 17:29.820
Interesting.

17:29.820 --> 17:30.820
Interesting.

17:30.820 --> 17:36.660
And so you've kind of collected all this, well, you actually did you find in going

17:36.660 --> 17:44.180
through the process that there was some data that you needed that you didn't have?

17:44.180 --> 17:45.180
There's always data.

17:45.180 --> 17:49.180
There's always, you're always like to have more in this business, obviously.

17:49.180 --> 17:56.700
And I think it really comes down to the ability to really connect with folks that piece of

17:56.700 --> 18:02.220
information that says, I want to go beyond email and in-app messages, right?

18:02.220 --> 18:07.820
It's the ability to figure out specifically, you know, I'm tied to you here.

18:07.820 --> 18:15.420
You're talking to my bot on Facebook or on Twitter, you know, understanding exactly how

18:15.420 --> 18:20.860
I can, I can provide a message on various devices at the right time because we're still

18:20.860 --> 18:26.140
a little hindered by you have to approve every kind of communication channel.

18:26.140 --> 18:31.460
More information there and more ability to connect with you beyond just email and in-app

18:31.460 --> 18:33.460
would be obviously be powerful.

18:33.460 --> 18:38.380
The other piece that we're trying to get into is friends of people that we know, right?

18:38.380 --> 18:43.180
So going back to Mary, I know Mary went out for Tuesday, wine.

18:43.180 --> 18:46.980
I don't know enough yet about Mary's friends, right?

18:46.980 --> 18:54.580
And the group that we also are trying to target, as you can imagine, are very friend driven

18:54.580 --> 18:57.380
from a recommendation engine perspective, right?

18:57.380 --> 19:01.500
So when a group of friends, someone always asks, well, where are we going tonight?

19:01.500 --> 19:03.500
They take the input of their friends, right?

19:03.500 --> 19:09.820
So if I can get one of those friends to suggest Fridays, first, I got to win, right?

19:09.820 --> 19:15.580
And so we're really working hard now to understand, okay, how do I get into the networks of these

19:15.580 --> 19:23.260
people that I know to create more engagement, to create more recommendation opportunities,

19:23.260 --> 19:28.300
to be able to extend, basically, our reach of those that we really know into those that

19:28.300 --> 19:31.220
we would like to know and help us recommend.

19:31.220 --> 19:34.620
And what does that mean for you to explore something like that?

19:34.620 --> 19:40.980
Do you have some set of folks that are kind of dedicated to R&D or you doing, you have

19:40.980 --> 19:46.980
kind of an evolving proof of concept or some effort that you're working on to try to

19:46.980 --> 19:50.860
explore these avenues, or is it more keeping your eyes open and ears to the ground and

19:50.860 --> 19:52.460
seeing what other folks are doing?

19:52.460 --> 19:53.460
Yeah.

19:53.460 --> 19:57.980
So right now, we have a couple of people that, again, I kind of dedicate to the, what's

19:57.980 --> 20:00.180
next category?

20:00.180 --> 20:06.020
They're always kind of searching, talking to, you know, new startups, third parties to understand,

20:06.020 --> 20:08.460
what's emerging, what's possible.

20:08.460 --> 20:13.620
And so they are kind of my, you know, my seekers, so to speak, in terms of going out and

20:13.620 --> 20:17.740
trying to understand what can we leverage, what's new and innovative.

20:17.740 --> 20:22.580
In this case, in that specific example, I gave, we have early conversations going in terms

20:22.580 --> 20:23.780
of how to make that happen.

20:23.780 --> 20:28.180
We don't have a pilot rolling out yet, but to me, it's the next piece we need to push

20:28.180 --> 20:29.180
through.

20:29.180 --> 20:33.220
In terms of the, get it down the, I forget what was the name of the company that you

20:33.220 --> 20:34.220
mentioned?

20:34.220 --> 20:35.220
Amparity.

20:35.220 --> 20:36.380
Amparity.

20:36.380 --> 20:42.940
And I guess I'm curious about the various technology pieces and platforms that were used

20:42.940 --> 20:44.660
to pull all this together.

20:44.660 --> 20:50.620
So Amparity, it sounds like they had a big part in the connecting the dots pieces, you

20:50.620 --> 20:55.980
know, pulling information from, I'm assuming, various silos that you've got your CRMs,

20:55.980 --> 21:03.140
your transactional systems, et cetera, and making that available via some fashion.

21:03.140 --> 21:06.140
But then there are pieces like the chat platform itself.

21:06.140 --> 21:10.740
Did you use an off-the-shelf platform, or did you build one yourself?

21:10.740 --> 21:20.980
Some of the AI or analytics pieces that you describe for determining the next best offer,

21:20.980 --> 21:24.820
you know, is that stuff that you built yourself or stuff that you used off the shelf?

21:24.820 --> 21:28.300
Can you talk a little bit about the technology landscape that enables all this?

21:28.300 --> 21:29.300
Sure.

21:29.300 --> 21:35.380
So, the underlying, what I'll call data warehouse areas is powered by Microsoft.

21:35.380 --> 21:37.700
We're obviously all in the cloud with Azure.

21:37.700 --> 21:43.340
We have, you know, the data lakes that house all the information for us, kind of feeding

21:43.340 --> 21:44.340
that.

21:44.340 --> 21:50.380
Obviously, we have all our tier-point transactional data, whether that be from our restaurants

21:50.380 --> 21:56.100
that's driven by, from a front-of-house perspective, micros, back-of-house, NCR.

21:56.100 --> 22:01.860
We have the online platform that drives data into that, which is powered by Adobe and

22:01.860 --> 22:04.980
our hybrid platform from SAP.

22:04.980 --> 22:09.780
So those are kind of the big pieces of data, you know, moving on to the new technologies

22:09.780 --> 22:14.100
like our chatbots and the AI that powers those.

22:14.100 --> 22:20.100
We partnered with a great firm out of Austin called Conversable and Conversable Powers.

22:20.100 --> 22:26.060
All of that for us, whether it be on Facebook, Twitter, Amazon Alexa, and we just launched

22:26.060 --> 22:32.460
with GM's on-star platform, so we're in millions of on-star vehicles now.

22:32.460 --> 22:34.260
Do people actually use that?

22:34.260 --> 22:35.260
They do.

22:35.260 --> 22:36.260
Believe it or not.

22:36.260 --> 22:37.260
Yes.

22:37.260 --> 22:39.340
And, you know, we've just started with them.

22:39.340 --> 22:43.860
So we don't have the ordering turned on, but we have the, you can make a reservation for

22:43.860 --> 22:47.340
a table like on your way in the car, you're looking for a restaurant, it obviously gives you

22:47.340 --> 22:49.580
directions to the local Fridays.

22:49.580 --> 22:53.500
Pretty soon we'll have the capability to, you know, have your first drink waiting for

22:53.500 --> 22:55.500
you at the table on your way.

22:55.500 --> 23:01.180
So yeah, I mean, we got a lot of fun things planned, again, engaging, we're a fun and social

23:01.180 --> 23:02.180
brand.

23:02.180 --> 23:04.180
Yeah, yeah.

23:04.180 --> 23:05.180
But Conversable helps power all that.

23:05.180 --> 23:11.380
They also have the AI engine behind that that allows us to, again, create the machine creates

23:11.380 --> 23:18.060
new content personalized to the conversation that's occurring across the different platforms.

23:18.060 --> 23:23.300
That all, again, feeds into, it's kind of a loop into impurity that helps us understand

23:23.300 --> 23:29.260
these personas, connects the dots, feeds that back into things like conversable so that

23:29.260 --> 23:34.500
the machine learns and can be better at targeting what they say to Mary versus Sally.

23:34.500 --> 23:38.340
So that's really the core engines of our technology.

23:38.340 --> 23:44.700
With regards to the work that Conversable did and or rather the work that you did around

23:44.700 --> 23:52.220
the chatbot, like how much of the process of getting that up and running did the vendor

23:52.220 --> 24:00.660
do versus your team do and where kind of where the interfaces and the leverage points and

24:00.660 --> 24:03.420
things like that, that question makes any sense.

24:03.420 --> 24:04.420
Yeah, sure.

24:04.420 --> 24:05.420
No.

24:05.420 --> 24:10.140
You know, again, we relied, you know, in that example on Conversable, a great deal to really

24:10.140 --> 24:16.100
help from a technical perspective and from an integration perspective, obviously working

24:16.100 --> 24:22.420
with the Facebook and Twitter's and Amazon's of the world, GM of the world to do all the

24:22.420 --> 24:28.860
integration pieces to really set up, again, kind of the wireframe, so to speak, the building

24:28.860 --> 24:30.940
blocks of what we need to have.

24:30.940 --> 24:37.380
So my team was more around helping what I would call tailor the experience, you know,

24:37.380 --> 24:42.060
and making sure that it's, you know, it's in a Friday's voice, right, and making sure

24:42.060 --> 24:47.220
that it's connecting in the right way so that, you know, A, the bots are not inappropriate,

24:47.220 --> 24:49.460
they're doing the right things, right?

24:49.460 --> 24:55.740
So the, I would say the walls, the house, you know, is built by Conversable, I would

24:55.740 --> 25:00.780
say, you know, my team is more around putting the paint on the walls and the artwork on

25:00.780 --> 25:05.860
the walls to make sure it's ours versus some generic bot.

25:05.860 --> 25:11.180
So the, the bots, you know, there's this whole integration piece that talks to all of

25:11.180 --> 25:18.860
the various platforms and then there's the natural language, just understanding natural

25:18.860 --> 25:25.540
language, processing stuff that, you know, typically is like understanding the intense,

25:25.540 --> 25:30.420
the intent of the person that you're talking to and like, what are the various, you know,

25:30.420 --> 25:34.460
entities and things like that that people might be talking about and all of that kind

25:34.460 --> 25:41.940
of stuff is that all things that your team had to come up to speed on or is that stuff

25:41.940 --> 25:45.940
that you relied on the vendor to handle for you?

25:45.940 --> 25:46.940
Yeah.

25:46.940 --> 25:47.940
Great deal of that.

25:47.940 --> 25:48.940
We, we relied on Conversable.

25:48.940 --> 25:54.300
Obviously, as my team got more learned, I would say, we had more input.

25:54.300 --> 26:00.460
We started asking more questions that helped, I think, make the combined team better.

26:00.460 --> 26:05.420
And I think, but yeah, clearly this was a, this was a, we kind of jumped with both feet,

26:05.420 --> 26:08.180
not sure where we were landing.

26:08.180 --> 26:11.940
We relied a great deal on our partners to get us up to speed quickly.

26:11.940 --> 26:16.260
And then really a lot of that initial, what I'll call, trial and error.

26:16.260 --> 26:21.220
We continue to refine, refine, refine as we got smarter, as we got smarter, they got smarter

26:21.220 --> 26:25.460
in terms of what our guests were doing from an interaction perspective.

26:25.460 --> 26:30.700
And really, I think the, the issue, the interesting piece was the nuance in terms of how do you

26:30.700 --> 26:32.940
have to refine it by platform?

26:32.940 --> 26:37.660
Just doing what we did when we launched Facebook as our first one, you couldn't just replicate

26:37.660 --> 26:38.900
it onto Twitter.

26:38.900 --> 26:44.740
It was a different conversations, different guests, different, just different vernacular

26:44.740 --> 26:47.340
in certain cases that we had to employ, right?

26:47.340 --> 26:51.060
Because it's a different user group in a lot of, in a lot of cases.

26:51.060 --> 26:55.260
And then similarly, when we went to Amazon, right, it's a completely different, because

26:55.260 --> 26:57.540
people are talking versus typing.

26:57.540 --> 27:01.140
And so is that kind of refinement on to your point?

27:01.140 --> 27:08.140
How do you ensure that your, your understanding, the context of the discussion is very different

27:08.140 --> 27:09.140
by platform.

27:09.140 --> 27:13.300
And that's really where we started to integrate and started to work together a lot more.

27:13.300 --> 27:16.980
Because we could see these conversations happening even before the bot, right?

27:16.980 --> 27:19.900
We were talking to people with humans.

27:19.900 --> 27:23.820
And so that's where we started inputting a lot more in terms of the tone and the content

27:23.820 --> 27:28.460
that that we needed to have to be Fridays in these conversations.

27:28.460 --> 27:35.780
And so was this effort entirely driven by IT, or did you partner with a particular area

27:35.780 --> 27:38.380
of the business to drive this forward?

27:38.380 --> 27:43.940
And you know, what are kind of at least the Fridays, like what do those relationships

27:43.940 --> 27:49.620
look like with regards to AI or the businesses kind of asking for this stuff, or are you more

27:49.620 --> 27:55.340
out in front trying to figure it out and providing examples that will get them interested?

27:55.340 --> 27:58.220
Yeah, I think initially we were out in front.

27:58.220 --> 28:00.620
You know, this was something that we were pushing.

28:00.620 --> 28:06.420
I wanted to push specifically, because I felt it helped differentiate us from our competition,

28:06.420 --> 28:07.420
right?

28:07.420 --> 28:09.420
We're looking for, you know, how do we be different?

28:09.420 --> 28:13.940
And I don't, I don't want to compete against chilies and apple bees, because I don't

28:13.940 --> 28:15.420
consider them my competition.

28:15.420 --> 28:22.420
I consider a competition of anyone that's thinking about going for a drink or some bite of

28:22.420 --> 28:23.420
food, right?

28:23.420 --> 28:28.220
And so that's a much larger landscape, and so I'm competing against Starbucks in certain

28:28.220 --> 28:29.220
cases, right?

28:29.220 --> 28:34.660
And so I think, you know, we have to be more technologically forward and innovative in

28:34.660 --> 28:35.900
the eyes of our guests.

28:35.900 --> 28:40.420
So we pushed a lot of that initially, but I'll tell you, as soon as we started doing some

28:40.420 --> 28:45.460
of these tests, and we started, you know, partnering and showing our friends in my counterpart

28:45.460 --> 28:48.260
in marketing, you know, they came right on board.

28:48.260 --> 28:52.420
They're like, now they're pushing us like, you know, faster or more, right?

28:52.420 --> 28:56.460
Let's, I want to know Sally versus Mary, because I want to send them specific content,

28:56.460 --> 28:57.460
right?

28:57.460 --> 29:01.860
So they're pushing and we're, we have a great partner, my CMO colleague Stephanie Perdue

29:01.860 --> 29:06.580
and I are connected at the hip on this and really working to figure out, again, how do

29:06.580 --> 29:10.820
we continue to push the needle here, similarly on the operation side, you know, bringing

29:10.820 --> 29:17.380
those that the benefit of AI into our operators and into the four walls, you know, our, our

29:17.380 --> 29:20.780
head of operations here and I are also now like, what's next?

29:20.780 --> 29:25.420
You know, can we, can we give wearables to the servers so that they're, they're getting

29:25.420 --> 29:28.060
real-time information about who's walking on the door?

29:28.060 --> 29:34.740
And so it's a lot of, again, people have started to see the power of what this can do.

29:34.740 --> 29:39.860
And now we're, I'd say we're much more relaxed to have been in terms of how fast, how far,

29:39.860 --> 29:41.460
you know, and how much.

29:41.460 --> 29:48.660
And so how do you see the role of the IT viewer organization shifting to accommodate the

29:48.660 --> 29:51.180
broader interest in these technologies?

29:51.180 --> 29:55.300
Yeah, I mean, to me, our role still has to be what's next.

29:55.300 --> 30:02.860
For us, you know, I pride my team in pushing them to really continue to push the ball

30:02.860 --> 30:05.300
forward, continue to ask the question, what's next?

30:05.300 --> 30:09.660
What are other people even thinking about that we can be first, right?

30:09.660 --> 30:14.820
So, you know, we were, we were first to use Amazon Pay on Amazon Alexa.

30:14.820 --> 30:20.380
We're the, one of the first brands on new GM on-stars marketplace where, you know,

30:20.380 --> 30:26.380
one of the first brands to connect one click ordering on Facebook and Twitter.

30:26.380 --> 30:31.020
And so those types of things to me again help differentiate us, you know, I look to the

30:31.020 --> 30:35.340
Starbucks and the Domino's of the world because they are truly technology companies that

30:35.340 --> 30:37.460
happen to sell coffee and pizza.

30:37.460 --> 30:43.780
I want Fridays to be recognized from a technology perspective as being technology first, technology

30:43.780 --> 30:46.860
forward that happened to sell beer and ribs.

30:46.860 --> 30:48.940
And then I think we get rewarded for that.

30:48.940 --> 30:52.100
I think our guests appreciate that.

30:52.100 --> 30:56.700
And so that to me is the role that my team has and very proud of their work and their

30:56.700 --> 31:01.700
efforts because they continue to lead and drive the innovation forward.

31:01.700 --> 31:06.500
Do you have a short list of things that you see as being that next, those next set of

31:06.500 --> 31:07.500
things?

31:07.500 --> 31:12.100
Yeah, I really want to do more with bringing digital inside the restaurant, right?

31:12.100 --> 31:17.180
We, a lot of, a lot of effort by us in our counterparts is, you know, when people are

31:17.180 --> 31:20.100
walking around outside the four walls, right?

31:20.100 --> 31:24.820
All the mobile things and I, you know, are my big push for this coming year is how do

31:24.820 --> 31:29.820
we bring those digital experiences inside the four walls, you know, whether it's an

31:29.820 --> 31:34.420
interactive bar, a virtual bartender, you know, there's so many things that you can think

31:34.420 --> 31:40.340
about bringing technology, not an obtrusive fashion, but again, to support the environment

31:40.340 --> 31:45.900
that social occasion we want our guests to have with our team members and bartenders.

31:45.900 --> 31:52.500
How does technology potentially play there and make it not only fun, but creates a unique

31:52.500 --> 31:58.340
experience that guests say, well, that's cool and the only place I can do that is at Fridays.

31:58.340 --> 32:02.660
That's what we're really pushing for next year and I think the next couple of years is

32:02.660 --> 32:07.500
to create that more seamless integration between off premise and in restaurant as it relates

32:07.500 --> 32:13.060
to digital and how AI and some of the other technologies can help support that.

32:13.060 --> 32:18.780
And are there specific directions that you're playing in ahead to enable that or you kind

32:18.780 --> 32:20.540
of still trying to figure all that out?

32:20.540 --> 32:26.620
Well, I can't spill all my secrets on this, but you know, I think there's a lot of things

32:26.620 --> 32:27.620
that are in the works.

32:27.620 --> 32:32.620
We're still trying to figure some of it out, to be honest, I have the benefit of having

32:32.620 --> 32:37.660
a test restaurant, so to speak, a little lab that we get to try fun things.

32:37.660 --> 32:38.660
So, you know, we're...

32:38.660 --> 32:40.100
Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun.

32:40.100 --> 32:41.100
It's a ton of fun.

32:41.100 --> 32:47.380
So, I've been able to try bar tops that are like iPads and being able to do things around

32:47.380 --> 32:51.460
the TVs around our bar that bring again the guests into the experience.

32:51.460 --> 32:56.100
So, those are just little teasers and we'll have to talk next year, so I can give you

32:56.100 --> 32:57.100
more.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.100
Awesome.

32:58.100 --> 33:04.380
And then as you think to rolling all of this out, what strike you as some of the big challenges

33:04.380 --> 33:06.380
that you'll face in the process?

33:06.380 --> 33:09.820
Yeah, I think the biggest two big challenges.

33:09.820 --> 33:15.940
One is to make sure we don't get too far in front of our guests or our organization.

33:15.940 --> 33:21.180
And what I mean by that is, you know, sometimes technology, just for technology's sake, can

33:21.180 --> 33:22.900
be a massive failure, right?

33:22.900 --> 33:26.380
It gets too far in front, guests aren't sure what to do with it.

33:26.380 --> 33:32.180
They don't see it as a value, our operations can't support it, so I can give good information

33:32.180 --> 33:36.420
to someone, but if they don't do anything with it, it was a failed exercise, right?

33:36.420 --> 33:41.780
And so, I think it's making sure that we continue to be in lockstep and have our guests tell

33:41.780 --> 33:46.780
us what they're looking for, you know, in certain cases to be more convenient, frictionless,

33:46.780 --> 33:48.940
more fun, social, et cetera.

33:48.940 --> 33:52.660
And there are operators as well that tell us what they can handle and what they can, we

33:52.660 --> 33:56.900
can ensure they execute on a daily basis across our 900 plus restaurants.

33:56.900 --> 34:02.300
I think the other piece that we have to just make sure of is that again, there's a lot

34:02.300 --> 34:03.980
of cool things we can do, right?

34:03.980 --> 34:07.180
And at the end of the day, you know, cool doesn't pay the bills.

34:07.180 --> 34:14.500
We have to make sure that everything we do is tied to an ROI, it's tied to a returnable,

34:14.500 --> 34:17.860
you know, whether that be, you know, obviously revenue is the easiest thing to measure, but

34:17.860 --> 34:23.740
even guest engagement and frequency and loyalty and, you know, if it doesn't tie back to one

34:23.740 --> 34:28.420
of those strategic pillars, then it may be cool, but it's not going to be for us.

34:28.420 --> 34:33.060
And so I think we have to continue to always, I would say, measure ourselves or guard ourselves

34:33.060 --> 34:38.460
against getting too far out and then also doing things that just have PR value, but don't

34:38.460 --> 34:42.180
really move the needle for the organization, right?

34:42.180 --> 34:44.860
Anything else you'd like to leave the audience with?

34:44.860 --> 34:48.620
Well, I think the only thing I think, you know, if people are even considering doing

34:48.620 --> 34:53.500
this or they're starting their efforts, you know, to me, there's just a few lessons

34:53.500 --> 34:58.980
learned that I would, I would impart here at the end, you know, one again is really take

34:58.980 --> 35:03.900
your time, you know, there's no word for speed in this area, you know, the technology can

35:03.900 --> 35:09.620
get overwhelming, take your time, learn it, test the heck out of it, make sure it's right

35:09.620 --> 35:14.780
for what you want to achieve, because it can do a lot, but it can also get you in trouble

35:14.780 --> 35:17.220
if you don't have some guardrails.

35:17.220 --> 35:21.660
The second thing I'd say is, you know, going back to the earlier conversation, don't

35:21.660 --> 35:27.460
try to do this alone, this is a wide open kind of Wild West Frontier, there are some

35:27.460 --> 35:33.740
good emerging partners out there, my suggestion is to utilize them even if it's to have a conversation

35:33.740 --> 35:38.740
so that you don't, you don't bloody your knees where that path's already been taken.

35:38.740 --> 35:41.940
And finally, just always remember what you're doing it for.

35:41.940 --> 35:46.100
In our case, it's for the guest and ensuring that you always kind of keep that in mind and

35:46.100 --> 35:49.980
tie it back to, you know, what are the key questions that you're trying to answer and

35:49.980 --> 35:54.300
is it really going to make, you know, your customer, your guest better in terms of their

35:54.300 --> 35:58.820
interaction, their experience with your brand. For us, that's kind of the holy grail, if

35:58.820 --> 36:04.020
it doesn't impact them in a positive light, in a positive way, then we don't do it.

36:04.020 --> 36:09.220
That all sounds like excellent advice. Sounds like you've been down this road a few times.

36:09.220 --> 36:11.220
Yes. A lot of bloody knees.

36:11.220 --> 36:16.340
