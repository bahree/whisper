All right, on to the show.

01:33.480 --> 01:36.360
All right, everyone.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.560
I am on the line with Aaron Ma.

01:39.560 --> 01:46.080
Aaron is in the sixth grade and he is 11 years old.

01:46.080 --> 01:48.760
Aaron, welcome to the Twimal AI podcast.

01:48.760 --> 01:51.160
Thanks you for having me, Sam.

01:51.160 --> 01:57.160
I really can't explain how excited I am to kind of dive into this conversation.

01:57.160 --> 02:04.280
One of your many accomplishments is just the amount of dedication and accomplishment

02:04.280 --> 02:07.560
you've invested in learning machine learning.

02:07.560 --> 02:14.960
You've got three Udacity nano degrees on the topic and you've done 80 Coursera courses.

02:14.960 --> 02:18.600
Let's just start out by having you share a little bit with us.

02:18.600 --> 02:24.000
How did you initially get interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence?

02:24.000 --> 02:25.000
Okay.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.880
So first of all, I'm going to type out how I got started into computer science first

02:28.880 --> 02:29.880
of all.

02:29.880 --> 02:35.280
So when I was five, I got my first computer, which was a handy nail for my dad.

02:35.280 --> 02:41.040
And it's an IMF 2008 with 2.4 gigahertz and 2 gigabytes of RAM.

02:41.040 --> 02:47.040
So at first, I would be doing educational stuff like grads, kids, extramaths, Google

02:47.040 --> 02:48.880
classroom, etc.

02:48.880 --> 02:52.760
But then one day, I thought, hmm, how does this computer work?

02:52.760 --> 02:56.040
Does it use images, screenshots?

02:56.040 --> 02:57.040
Hmm.

02:57.040 --> 03:02.080
So I decided to ask my dad and my dad said it was based on coding.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.880
So I decided to learn coding.

03:03.880 --> 03:09.280
So the first thing that I remember learned is HTFL, which is a great language for building

03:09.280 --> 03:10.280
websites.

03:10.280 --> 03:13.360
But then I faced a major disastrous problem.

03:13.360 --> 03:18.400
It's because if I just use HTML, all I have is black and white.

03:18.400 --> 03:25.200
And I want my users on my website to have a rich, detailed experience.

03:25.200 --> 03:32.600
So I decided to learn CSS to create a rich story and make it more colorful on the website.

03:32.600 --> 03:37.520
And then I learned JavaScript to make my websites more dynamic.

03:37.520 --> 03:43.560
And I'm proud to say that the first website I've ever made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

03:43.560 --> 03:52.520
is my to-do list, which is basically a web app where you can create, delete, insert,

03:52.520 --> 03:58.360
remove all of her to-do, and it's all stored in your browser cache.

03:58.360 --> 04:04.120
And also around that time, my dad took me to my dad's coworker's party.

04:04.120 --> 04:11.160
So during the party, one of my dad's coworkers brought the materials for s'mores, like

04:11.160 --> 04:14.760
graham crackers, chocolates, and etc.

04:14.760 --> 04:21.400
So I decided to make myself useful by using those s'mores materials to actually make s'mores.

04:21.400 --> 04:25.120
So a lot of people ate s'mores because I made them.

04:25.120 --> 04:30.360
Then my dad's coworker, called Jeremy, came up to me and said, you should make a website

04:30.360 --> 04:33.120
if you're so interested in making s'mores.

04:33.120 --> 04:39.000
I thought, hmm, I shouldn't do that because since I'm interested in you programming, and

04:39.000 --> 04:41.560
I was a low-micky s'mores, I shouldn't make a website on it.

04:41.560 --> 04:44.360
And I decided to call it the Roasting Company.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.360
The Roasting Company?

04:46.360 --> 04:49.200
Yep, Roasting Company.

04:49.200 --> 04:55.280
But then when I told Jeremy that I was going to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, he was

04:55.280 --> 04:58.680
like, no, no, no, you should use Angular.

04:58.680 --> 05:04.240
Yes, everyone's new favorite writing framework.

05:04.240 --> 05:10.040
So the first thing I did when I came home was go to plurersight.com and search Angular

05:10.040 --> 05:12.040
tutorials.

05:12.040 --> 05:18.600
And I've learned Angular from industry experts like Deborah Carrotta and John Papa.

05:18.600 --> 05:26.360
So then I learned Angular and also the Angular router and also Angular material.

05:26.360 --> 05:31.360
And also after learning Angular, my dad took me to my first Angular meetup, and I should

05:31.360 --> 05:33.360
also say my first meetup.

05:33.360 --> 05:37.720
So during the meetup, did I get this, how old were you when all this happened?

05:37.720 --> 05:43.120
So that time I was not when I went to my first meetup, Angular meetup.

05:43.120 --> 05:50.000
And during the meetup, there was the native script team who came in and during the middle

05:50.000 --> 05:54.840
of the meetup, there was a native script deputy because the native script team was there.

05:54.840 --> 05:59.280
So they asked for volunteers to play the native script deputy.

05:59.280 --> 06:05.200
And when they asked for volunteers, literally nobody in the entire room raised their hand,

06:05.200 --> 06:06.840
literally nobody.

06:06.840 --> 06:10.640
So I decided to raise my hand on volunteer.

06:10.640 --> 06:13.840
And three more adults came in and joined me.

06:13.840 --> 06:17.240
At first, everyone was like, ha, this is such a joke.

06:17.240 --> 06:21.640
But that after entering the first question correctly, which is, what is the native script

06:21.640 --> 06:27.200
command line to a call, which I answered T and S, and also answering a few more questions

06:27.200 --> 06:30.000
correctly?

06:30.000 --> 06:35.960
Everyone in the audience was like, I knew that I could actually program.

06:35.960 --> 06:40.720
So one of the people on the native script team called Sebastian Metallic was pretty impressive

06:40.720 --> 06:41.720
to me.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.520
And he asked me, do you have a Twitter, so he could follow me.

06:44.520 --> 06:50.280
And I said no, because what could a nine-year-old learn Twitter from?

06:50.280 --> 06:55.400
So the first thing I did when I came home from that meetup was going to Twitter and creating

06:55.400 --> 06:56.400
a Twitter account.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.920
And Sebastian became my first follower.

06:58.920 --> 07:02.080
So if you're listening to this podcast right now, thank you, Sebastian.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.080
Shout out.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.080
What's his Twitter handle?

07:05.080 --> 07:06.080
Do you remember?

07:06.080 --> 07:09.480
I think it's Sebastian Metallic.

07:09.480 --> 07:14.920
And then after a few more months of going to more angular, learning more about angular,

07:14.920 --> 07:23.880
that's a great presentation in August of last year, when I woke up, my dad told me that

07:23.880 --> 07:28.440
I should learn machine learning and AI, because it's going to be the future.

07:28.440 --> 07:31.880
And I always want to be able to keep up with the future.

07:31.880 --> 07:37.680
And also the second reason I wanted to learn machine learning AI was because you can

07:37.680 --> 07:41.760
make mula from it.

07:41.760 --> 07:46.000
So is your dad into machine learning or programming?

07:46.000 --> 07:51.080
He's interested, he's into programming, but he's not into machine learning AI.

07:51.080 --> 07:52.080
He does Friday.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.080
Okay.

07:53.080 --> 07:59.560
So the third reason that I wanted to learn machine learning and AI is because we can save lives

07:59.560 --> 08:02.080
using machine learning and AI.

08:02.080 --> 08:08.640
For example, one day, if we have a machine learning power robot that could perform surgeries

08:08.640 --> 08:16.560
or detect cancer, people who are living in poverty can actually afford cheap medical care.

08:16.560 --> 08:23.520
So basically, everyone can have access to medical care, even people who are in poverty.

08:23.520 --> 08:27.360
So these are the three main reasons why I wanted to learn machine learning.

08:27.360 --> 08:34.840
So that I went to youtube.com like every other kid out there and searched machine learning

08:34.840 --> 08:40.560
tutorials and from machine learning tutorials online, I actually started to learn machine learning

08:40.560 --> 08:41.560
pick up basics.

08:41.560 --> 08:44.480
What was the first thing that you learned?

08:44.480 --> 08:47.040
The first thing you learned was Python.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.040
Okay.

08:48.040 --> 08:52.480
So you didn't have any exposure to Python before you started studying machine learning?

08:52.480 --> 08:53.480
Yes.

08:53.480 --> 08:59.120
So then from there, after learning Python, I started to learn the types of machine learning,

08:59.120 --> 09:04.040
the fields of machine learning, and also tenser flow.

09:04.040 --> 09:10.000
And I chose central because it's backed by Google, it's open source and free, and it has

09:10.000 --> 09:17.760
a large environment community, it's in demand, it's also easy to use, compatibility across

09:17.760 --> 09:24.040
so much platforms, there's also tenser board and also has integrations, auto differentiation

09:24.040 --> 09:28.040
and is even better than PyTorch for research to production.

09:28.040 --> 09:34.000
So after learning TensorFlow, I wanted to share my knowledge of TensorFlow.

09:34.000 --> 09:40.560
To the front-end community, because at that time that's all in the front-end community.

09:40.560 --> 09:47.800
So the problem is that most of the people in the front-end community only knows JavaScript

09:47.800 --> 09:53.480
and they don't know Python, so if they don't know Python, how do they know TensorFlow?

09:53.480 --> 09:59.280
So I needed a way to get TensorFlow for JavaScript, first I was like, oh no, I'm going to have

09:59.280 --> 10:04.880
to create my own npm page, and I'm going to have to maintain it, etc. But then luckily

10:04.880 --> 10:13.240
I Google TensorFlow for JavaScript, in which I got the result of TensorFlow.js, and I was

10:13.240 --> 10:18.600
pretty lucky because they just released it about a year ago during that time.

10:18.600 --> 10:25.320
So I was pretty lucky on searching that one, and since I already know TensorFlow, if there

10:25.320 --> 10:31.440
be no TensorFlow, when you learn TensorFlow.js, all I take you is about 30 minutes to learn.

10:31.440 --> 10:39.440
All I have to do is learn how to install TensorFlow.js, how to call some of the core stuff in TensorFlow.js,

10:39.440 --> 10:44.640
and you have to learn the differences between the syntax differences.

10:44.640 --> 10:51.320
For example, in TensorFlow, you use print, the default native Python print.

10:51.320 --> 10:58.360
When it didn't JavaScript with TensorFlow.js, you have to use TensorFlow.js as print statements,

10:58.360 --> 10:59.360
stuff like that.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.440
This maybe it paused there.

11:01.440 --> 11:06.720
There's a ton in the learn between Python and TensorFlow.

11:06.720 --> 11:08.600
Tell me a little bit more about that path.

11:08.600 --> 11:13.260
What were some of the things that, I mean, you first have to start with simple linear

11:13.260 --> 11:15.400
regressions and things like that.

11:15.400 --> 11:19.600
What were some of the things that you learned, and how did you learn them when you were first

11:19.600 --> 11:22.200
getting started with machine learning?

11:22.200 --> 11:29.000
To be honest, most of this, I'm still a beginner in machine learning, because there's a lot

11:29.000 --> 11:31.600
of math I still don't know right now.

11:31.600 --> 11:36.320
Since there's such a wide array of stuff to learn.

11:36.320 --> 11:40.840
So I'm always still learning more about machine learning and linear regression.

11:40.840 --> 11:47.560
I'm still learning more about it, but in TensorFlow, and also Python, I know kind of like implement

11:47.560 --> 11:48.560
it.

11:48.560 --> 11:57.760
Basic packages, like NumPy, which is numerical, Python, numerical expressions in Python, you

11:57.760 --> 12:00.920
know, other Python math libraries.

12:00.920 --> 12:06.960
So in general, I'm still learning more about the math behind machine learning than always

12:06.960 --> 12:08.280
learning.

12:08.280 --> 12:18.520
So right after learning TensorFlow.js and TensorFlow in November of last year is when I started

12:18.520 --> 12:23.720
to think about my Christmas presents, like every other kid, because in November of each

12:23.720 --> 12:27.760
year, it's always close to the holiday season.

12:27.760 --> 12:31.800
And every single kid starts thinking about their Christmas presents.

12:31.800 --> 12:40.680
So I also think, hmm, I've got to become a self-driving car engineer, but there's no

12:40.680 --> 12:45.480
place on the internet where it can learn it from.

12:45.480 --> 12:49.240
I googled it and I found, yeah, Google.

12:49.240 --> 12:55.920
So I found a Udacity self-driving car engineer management program, which is the advanced

12:55.920 --> 12:56.920
level.

12:56.920 --> 13:02.120
And there's also the self-driving car, I'm sorry, intro to self-driving cars, which is

13:02.120 --> 13:04.800
the beginner slash intermediate.

13:04.800 --> 13:13.280
So in that time, which was last year, it's November, Udacity is like $1,200 per semester

13:13.280 --> 13:16.280
I think, yeah, around that price.

13:16.280 --> 13:20.960
Although I think I'm already lowered it to around 160 per month now.

13:20.960 --> 13:26.520
So basically during that time, it was pretty expensive and I wanted to save my family's

13:26.520 --> 13:28.000
money.

13:28.000 --> 13:33.000
So I decided to basically take a look at the intro to self-driving cars to see what they're

13:33.000 --> 13:34.640
going to teach you.

13:34.640 --> 13:38.640
So basically, so what they're going to teach you, they're going to teach you Python and

13:38.640 --> 13:40.160
C++.

13:40.160 --> 13:47.040
So since I already know Python, I decided to just learn C++ to make up for the intro to

13:47.040 --> 13:48.040
self-driving cars.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.560
So you can save my family's money.

13:50.560 --> 13:58.360
So after learning C++, I enrolled into the self-driving car in your nanodegree program.

13:58.360 --> 14:00.600
And two days, I think three days.

14:00.600 --> 14:03.080
How many courses in that nanodegree program?

14:03.080 --> 14:04.880
In a nanodegree program.

14:04.880 --> 14:07.200
It's not sorted by courses.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.440
It's sorted by lessons.

14:09.440 --> 14:10.440
Okay.

14:10.440 --> 14:16.560
So in a nanodegree program, I think they have around like 16 lessons, depending on your

14:16.560 --> 14:17.960
nanodegree program.

14:17.960 --> 14:19.960
Got it.

14:19.960 --> 14:27.400
So about three days before the start of my self-driving car engineering nanodegree program,

14:27.400 --> 14:33.840
I received an email from the Dassy legal team saying, we're sorry, but due to your age

14:33.840 --> 14:39.120
that you're under 18 years old, by law, we have to legally terminate your nanodegree

14:39.120 --> 14:40.120
enrollment.

14:40.120 --> 14:44.160
At first, I was really frustrated because they're like breaking my dream because I really

14:44.160 --> 14:48.080
wanted to be a self-driving car engineer.

14:48.080 --> 14:54.160
So I googled on the internet for Sebastian through his email.

14:54.160 --> 14:59.760
In case people don't know, Sebastian through is the CEO and founder of Udacity at that

14:59.760 --> 15:04.240
time, although he sadly loved Udacity in June of this year.

15:04.240 --> 15:09.040
So after two days of searching the internet, I came across

15:09.040 --> 15:13.760
Sebastian through his email and there was like over 10 emails.

15:13.760 --> 15:17.200
So first of all, I'm not going to send spam to them.

15:17.200 --> 15:20.120
So I'm not going to send it to all of his emails.

15:20.120 --> 15:25.240
So I decided to just send him to his Udacity email because that's the email he most likely

15:25.240 --> 15:27.840
will check every single day.

15:27.840 --> 15:33.520
So if you're sending him an email, I received an email from him, which stated, start and

15:33.520 --> 15:36.520
finish and you make my day.

15:36.520 --> 15:43.000
And then Gina, who's an employee at Udacity, actually CC the Udacity legal team, which

15:43.000 --> 15:48.600
meant that the legal team had to hire a lawyer to write a form stating that I gave my child

15:48.600 --> 15:54.440
error permission to use Udacity services, etc, etc.

15:54.440 --> 15:59.480
And so in January of this year, that's when I basically started the self-driving engineer

15:59.480 --> 16:01.160
nanodegree program.

16:01.160 --> 16:07.120
So in the first term and out of two terms, because Udacity sorts their content by terms.

16:07.120 --> 16:13.960
So in the first term, I learned about perception, localization and computer vision.

16:13.960 --> 16:18.840
And although I didn't make the February deadline, I made it into the March deadline, which

16:18.840 --> 16:21.240
meant I could enroll to term two.

16:21.240 --> 16:29.600
So in terms two, I actually learned functional safety, control, path planning, and also building

16:29.600 --> 16:36.680
a real self-driving car using the robotic operating system or Ross for short.

16:36.680 --> 16:43.400
So in June of this year, June 18, I should say, of this year, that was the last day of

16:43.400 --> 16:47.040
which I was supposed to graduate on the morning of that day.

16:47.040 --> 16:54.520
I saw that I sent emails to Udacity's graduation team, but I still didn't receive a reply.

16:54.520 --> 16:59.120
So I decided to drive there to Udacity's headquarters.

16:59.120 --> 17:05.080
So at the headquarters, basically, I told them that I already completed all of the projects,

17:05.080 --> 17:06.080
all of the parts stuff.

17:06.080 --> 17:10.760
And I already sent them three emails to the Udacity graduation team, but I didn't receive

17:10.760 --> 17:11.760
a reply.

17:11.760 --> 17:18.040
So basically, they helped me by using their email, Udacity emails, to send it to the Udacity

17:18.040 --> 17:19.040
graduation team.

17:19.040 --> 17:25.560
And about like five minutes later, after sending that email, basically, they said, congratulations,

17:25.560 --> 17:30.120
you graduated from Udacity, self-driving heart engineering management program.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.880
And I was really excited.

17:32.880 --> 17:40.560
During my time at the Udacity headquarters, I met the David Silver, who is the content

17:40.560 --> 17:46.000
creator of the Udacity self-driving heart engineering management program, and also the lead

17:46.000 --> 17:49.400
of the house of autonomous systems at Udacity.

17:49.400 --> 17:56.000
I also saw Vienna Harvey, who is the owner of Udacity's own self-driving car, which they

17:56.000 --> 17:58.240
call it, Carla.

17:58.240 --> 18:05.760
And during my experience on the self-driving car, Carla, I was able to get hands on with

18:05.760 --> 18:06.760
the car.

18:06.760 --> 18:12.080
For example, I set up the camera, the lighters, the radars, and also running scripts on it,

18:12.080 --> 18:16.040
you know, so taking a look at the lighters stuff.

18:16.040 --> 18:20.920
And also basically checking out the code that they have written.

18:20.920 --> 18:25.160
And to me, I think it's like a wow, and you take a look at the car.

18:25.160 --> 18:33.400
Can you share a little bit of what you learned in the like the first semester of that nanodegree?

18:33.400 --> 18:39.120
You mentioned that you were studying perception and localization and vision, and I know there's

18:39.120 --> 18:42.760
a lot of math in those classes that you probably didn't get into.

18:42.760 --> 18:48.960
But what were some of the main things that you were able to take away from the class?

18:48.960 --> 18:49.960
The main things.

18:49.960 --> 18:58.800
Well, I'd say, for example, in the computer vision part of the first semester, they taught

18:58.800 --> 19:05.360
us about unmistoric images, which I've never heard of before, because all I knew was

19:05.360 --> 19:11.640
like cameras are the best, because for example, you can see everything of cameras, but they

19:11.640 --> 19:17.600
said no, you can't see everything of the camera, or visually, everything in cameras is already

19:17.600 --> 19:18.600
distorted.

19:18.600 --> 19:25.120
So you actually have to write an algorithm for unmistoric images, so they did teach us

19:25.120 --> 19:34.240
the algorithm for understanding the images, and they taught us how to write code for it.

19:34.240 --> 19:39.680
Well, actually not writing code, just teaching us how to abort the CV2 library, which already

19:39.680 --> 19:43.280
handles the unmistored algorithm for us.

19:43.280 --> 19:48.880
And for the perception part of it in the first semester, I'd say I learned about all the

19:48.880 --> 19:51.480
different centers that come with perception.

19:51.480 --> 19:54.640
And also what's perception?

19:54.640 --> 20:01.280
Perception is basically connecting all those centers together, fusing them, which I also

20:01.280 --> 20:05.280
learned how to fuse all of that data together.

20:05.280 --> 20:12.120
For localization, I learned how to basically what localization is.

20:12.120 --> 20:19.040
They taught us that localization is basically comparing the objects around the car, using

20:19.040 --> 20:24.800
a lighter, with the objects in high-definition map, and you have to use localization for

20:24.800 --> 20:33.360
self-during cars, because high-definition maps has about 10 centimeters or more of errors.

20:33.360 --> 20:37.680
And when you're building a self-during car, you can't afford any errors, because by the

20:37.680 --> 20:42.000
time that you're already fixed those errors, or you don't even fix those errors, it's

20:42.000 --> 20:43.000
going to be too late.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.720
You're probably going to collide in objects or something.

20:45.720 --> 20:51.440
So you're going to have to use localization to make sure that you have one centimeter of

20:51.440 --> 20:53.440
error or less.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.440
So...

20:54.440 --> 21:00.520
And did you learn different localization algorithms, or is there just one way to do it?

21:00.520 --> 21:08.840
We learned about common filters, extended common filters, and also unscented common filters.

21:08.840 --> 21:16.960
And I think my favorite would be, I'd say, the unscented common filters.

21:16.960 --> 21:17.960
Unscented?

21:17.960 --> 21:18.960
Like, smell?

21:18.960 --> 21:19.960
What?

21:19.960 --> 21:20.960
Unscented.

21:20.960 --> 21:26.400
It's basically better than scented, because it's kind of, to me, I think it's more faster.

21:26.400 --> 21:31.880
So because when you're developing self-during cars, you want it to be as fast as possible.

21:31.880 --> 21:36.560
Because if it's going to be too slow, then you can fix a huge problem, and enough cars

21:36.560 --> 21:39.320
not going to be able to respond in time.

21:39.320 --> 21:43.120
So to me, I think the unscented common filters is the best.

21:43.120 --> 21:45.680
And so what is the common filter doing?

21:45.680 --> 21:47.240
How does that help you localize?

21:47.240 --> 21:54.840
Well, it's basically just comparing the lidar measurements to the high definition map.

21:54.840 --> 21:59.360
And if it's too far or too close, then it knows it's in the wrong place.

21:59.360 --> 22:05.080
And it's going to have to reposition itself with the control, which I learned in the second

22:05.080 --> 22:06.080
semester.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.080
Got it.

22:07.080 --> 22:10.480
So the first semester was all about trying to figure out where the car is, and the second

22:10.480 --> 22:17.880
semester is all about control system, and building a real second car with Ross.

22:17.880 --> 22:22.000
In the first class, when you're doing the perception and the common filtering stuff,

22:22.000 --> 22:29.160
like, are you doing that in notebooks, or IDEs, or are you doing it with like actual cars

22:29.160 --> 22:30.560
or simulations?

22:30.560 --> 22:32.560
What were some of the things you were using?

22:32.560 --> 22:35.840
So in the computer vision part, we use Jupyter notebooks.

22:35.840 --> 22:39.640
It's basically like the industry standard right now.

22:39.640 --> 22:48.320
And for the perception and also the localization, also for term two, we basically use VS Code.

22:48.320 --> 22:49.320
Okay.

22:49.320 --> 22:54.480
And so you need to bring notebooks basically switched to visuals to a code and determine

22:54.480 --> 22:55.480
them.

22:55.480 --> 22:56.480
Okay.

22:56.480 --> 22:57.480
Cool.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.480
So tell us about the second semester.

22:59.480 --> 23:04.080
So during the second semester, I learned about control and basically how to control the

23:04.080 --> 23:07.560
car and the controlling part.

23:07.560 --> 23:14.160
We actually got hands on with a simulated environment, basically control a car in the simulated

23:14.160 --> 23:15.160
environment.

23:15.160 --> 23:22.560
Although after trying multiple times my car still like jerk left to right sometimes, but

23:22.560 --> 23:25.160
overall, I think it was a pretty great experience.

23:25.160 --> 23:32.760
But after like about like 55 tries or something, I finally got it to be got it more precise.

23:32.760 --> 23:33.760
Okay.

23:33.760 --> 23:37.920
Finally, it's driving straight to the jerking left and right.

23:37.920 --> 23:42.120
Now I was a lot older than you when I was learning about control systems.

23:42.120 --> 23:46.400
I was in grad school and it was mostly analog stuff.

23:46.400 --> 23:54.800
If I remember correctly, like PID controllers, is that something that came up in your class?

23:54.800 --> 23:58.560
For personal integral, they're riveted, right, right, right.

23:58.560 --> 24:00.680
Is that tech used in self-driving cars?

24:00.680 --> 24:02.000
Sounds like yes.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
It's yes.

24:03.000 --> 24:07.880
Although people are now developing better control algorithms.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.800
What are some of the better ones?

24:09.800 --> 24:13.960
Some of them I haven't heard any of them, but I have heard that people are trying to

24:13.960 --> 24:14.960
develop them.

24:14.960 --> 24:15.960
Got it.

24:15.960 --> 24:16.960
Got it.

24:16.960 --> 24:22.200
Because it's still like really hard to develop something new because right now self-driving

24:22.200 --> 24:27.680
cars, it's really hard to develop because you have to be sure to safety, reliability and

24:27.680 --> 24:30.360
a bunch of different factors.

24:30.360 --> 24:34.400
You mentioned that functional safety was one of the topics.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.400
What does that mean?

24:35.400 --> 24:41.080
Basically, safety of your vehicle, learning about how to make your vehicle really safe and

24:41.080 --> 24:42.080
also vehicle stuff.

24:42.080 --> 24:46.480
For example, if you're going to build a real self-driving car, you're going to need to create

24:46.480 --> 24:56.320
a functional safety PDF file when we learn about ISO 26262, which basically is the functional

24:56.320 --> 24:59.720
safety standard autonomous vehicles.

24:59.720 --> 25:02.040
How about the path planning piece?

25:02.040 --> 25:03.560
The path planning.

25:03.560 --> 25:10.800
We basically created a proportional integral derivative controller, which would drive in

25:10.800 --> 25:14.560
a highway, which could drive by itself in the highway.

25:14.560 --> 25:22.080
And for the final project, the cash sum project, which was built a real self-driving car, we

25:22.080 --> 25:24.360
had to form like a team.

25:24.360 --> 25:29.880
So I set up to become a team leader in like within 24 hours, like over 10 people wanted to

25:29.880 --> 25:30.880
be in my team.

25:30.880 --> 25:37.600
Because I had like, cut it out, five or six people, because there's a team limit.

25:37.600 --> 25:41.000
There's a limit of how many people can be in your team.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.000
Okay.

25:42.000 --> 25:46.840
So in my team, I assigned everyone to their unique role.

25:46.840 --> 25:53.120
So I was the person who wrote the Roscoe because I'm good at Ros, and I assigned one person

25:53.120 --> 25:59.680
to work on the functional safety, one person on writing the readme file on how we created

25:59.680 --> 26:00.680
it.

26:00.680 --> 26:07.760
All the person writing the readme file for the Roscoe, how we linked our Roscoe together.

26:07.760 --> 26:14.280
So had you already been exposed to Ros prior to the course, or did you learn it in the course?

26:14.280 --> 26:21.640
I've been exposed to Roscoe before the course even happened around February, 2018.

26:21.640 --> 26:23.840
That's what I started.

26:23.840 --> 26:28.320
How did you get connected to or find out about Roscoe?

26:28.320 --> 26:35.320
I was in February of 2018, and this really crazy idea of building a robot, though it never

26:35.320 --> 26:36.320
actually happened.

26:36.320 --> 26:41.520
It was pretty sad because first of all, you need a $500,000 to build a robot, and then you

26:41.520 --> 26:46.600
need to buy all these hardware components, and then you have to wire all these up, program

26:46.600 --> 26:50.360
all of these, and test it, and sell it to a user for profit.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.600
So you wanted to build a big robot?

26:52.600 --> 26:56.320
Yet like a robot that could help you in your house though or something.

26:56.320 --> 26:57.320
Oh, wow.

26:57.320 --> 27:04.040
Right now, I can only test it in simulators, because it's too expensive to build a real

27:04.040 --> 27:06.160
robot with hardware and stuff.

27:06.160 --> 27:08.320
Have you ever built any small robots?

27:08.320 --> 27:16.560
I've built a Arduino robot, but the problem is that I accidentally bought the wrong wheels

27:16.560 --> 27:25.480
so it could only go forward, which was a bad choice in the making.

27:25.480 --> 27:29.480
I think the robots are a lot more interesting if they can turn, right?

27:29.480 --> 27:30.480
Right.

27:30.480 --> 27:35.560
You just, if it can't turn, eventually it's just going to collide with some object.

27:35.560 --> 27:36.560
Cool.

27:36.560 --> 27:41.520
So you're a second semester functional safety path planning, capstone projects.

27:41.520 --> 27:44.160
What was the capstone project?

27:44.160 --> 27:48.520
The capstone project was a building, a real sell chain car.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.520
Okay.

27:49.520 --> 27:54.800
That's just what you'd ask you to call a capstone project to make it like more engaging

27:54.800 --> 27:57.880
for people who want to enroll in the naming program.

27:57.880 --> 27:58.880
Got it.

27:58.880 --> 28:02.640
And what, this is a simulated self-driving car I'm assuming?

28:02.640 --> 28:03.640
Yes.

28:03.640 --> 28:10.600
All simulated, because if you're building a real sell chain car with rods, then you're

28:10.600 --> 28:15.320
going to have to, like, you're going to have to buy some sort of software rods for

28:15.320 --> 28:17.200
sell chain cars or something.

28:17.200 --> 28:22.160
So you guys, he doesn't want us to like pay for like a real sell chain car stuff.

28:22.160 --> 28:25.680
So they just basically create a simulated environment for us.

28:25.680 --> 28:30.520
And so how did the capstone project turn out?

28:30.520 --> 28:31.520
Pretty good.

28:31.520 --> 28:33.520
It turned out pretty good.

28:33.520 --> 28:39.640
Like we passed all of our projects, but there's only one problem that I sign up my team

28:39.640 --> 28:46.200
up for the lottery to test our code on the real sell chain car for Carla, because you

28:46.200 --> 28:54.400
actually has this sign up form where you can basically test your raw code on their autonomous

28:54.400 --> 28:55.400
vehicle, Carla.

28:55.400 --> 29:00.680
So they've already paid for the raw middleware for real selling cars.

29:00.680 --> 29:01.680
Okay.

29:01.680 --> 29:04.440
So they already put it on their car, they've already set that up.

29:04.440 --> 29:08.440
So they have to just put your code on it.

29:08.440 --> 29:12.080
But sadly, my team didn't win the lottery.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.080
Oh, no.

29:13.080 --> 29:15.880
So we never actually had a chance to test it on it.

29:15.880 --> 29:16.880
Oh, that's too bad.

29:16.880 --> 29:21.760
Right now, I'm trying to build a self-driving car that doesn't use Ross.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.760
Okay.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.480
What will your self-driving car use?

29:24.480 --> 29:32.240
Well, I'm planning to basically create my own sort of robotic operating system or something.

29:32.240 --> 29:33.960
So I can have more flexibility on it.

29:33.960 --> 29:39.760
It's going to be designed and specifically designed and tailored for self-driving cars.

29:39.760 --> 29:48.280
So Ross is used in lots of different types of robots to your point, not specifically tailored

29:48.280 --> 29:50.000
for self-driving cars.

29:50.000 --> 29:54.520
What are some of the ways that your operating system will be more suited for self-driving

29:54.520 --> 29:55.520
cars?

29:55.520 --> 30:01.400
First of all, I think that I'm going to make this self-driving car operating system that

30:01.400 --> 30:08.720
could basically fuse all the data together and also connect all of these nodes of these

30:08.720 --> 30:15.320
stuff together and also make it open-source and second of all.

30:15.320 --> 30:19.920
I also plan to basically have some sample code ready.

30:19.920 --> 30:26.280
Basically, if you only know how to build a hardware car, there's already software written

30:26.280 --> 30:27.280
out for you.

30:27.280 --> 30:33.360
So all you have to do is put the software on your car, which already has the hardware,

30:33.360 --> 30:40.160
which I think is the best way for people to get quickly their self-driving cars.

30:40.160 --> 30:42.200
So you don't have to do your own software.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.200
Very cool.

30:43.200 --> 30:48.600
I get the impression that that's just one of many projects that you're probably working

30:48.600 --> 30:49.920
on or thinking about.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.160
Are there others?

30:51.160 --> 30:52.200
There's a lot.

30:52.200 --> 31:00.680
In fact, right now, I'm also learning how to make a flying car, a flying car.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.640
Which I don't think is going to be a reality.

31:02.640 --> 31:05.480
Is there a nano-degree specialty for flying cars, too?

31:05.480 --> 31:06.480
Yep.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.480
The flying car nano-degree program.

31:07.480 --> 31:08.480
Oh, really?

31:08.480 --> 31:10.920
Have you started that one?

31:10.920 --> 31:11.920
No.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.640
I haven't started that one yet.

31:13.640 --> 31:21.760
So all of these three Udacity nano-degree 80 Coursera core certificates, what are your

31:21.760 --> 31:24.080
top three favorite classes?

31:24.080 --> 31:30.720
Well, my first learning would be the self-driving car engine and nano-degree program from Udacity.

31:30.720 --> 31:32.560
Okay.

31:32.560 --> 31:38.760
My second pick is the AI for trading nano-degree program from Udacity.

31:38.760 --> 31:40.520
AI for training?

31:40.520 --> 31:41.520
Trading.

31:41.520 --> 31:42.760
Trading for trading.

31:42.760 --> 31:47.480
Oh, so that's how you're going to fund your self-driving car is through trading.

31:47.480 --> 31:48.960
I'm investing stocks all day.

31:48.960 --> 31:56.560
I'm going to have a bot that's just going to keep buying, selling stocks all day long.

31:56.560 --> 32:03.240
My third of all is, I would say, the deep learning AI specialization on Coursera.

32:03.240 --> 32:04.240
The deep learning AI.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.760
What are some of the courses in that specialization?

32:06.760 --> 32:07.760
I'm sorry.

32:07.760 --> 32:10.320
The deep learning AI TensorFlow specialization.

32:10.320 --> 32:11.320
Ah.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.320
Okay.

32:12.320 --> 32:13.320
Okay.

32:13.320 --> 32:14.320
Okay.

32:14.320 --> 32:15.320
TensorFlow specialization.

32:15.320 --> 32:17.320
How many classes in that specialization?

32:17.320 --> 32:18.320
There's four.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.320
Four.

32:19.320 --> 32:20.320
And what are they?

32:20.320 --> 32:26.080
So basically, those four courses in the specialization teachers, you all about

32:26.080 --> 32:35.960
TensorFlow 2.0, but basically, it starts off with videos of really simplified stuff about

32:35.960 --> 32:36.960
TensorFlow.

32:36.960 --> 32:41.560
And then there's quizzes doing enhancer learning, and they provide a Jupyter Notebook

32:41.560 --> 32:47.400
lab environment, where they teach you the core concept of TensorFlow 2.0.

32:47.400 --> 32:50.640
So it's basically like this for all four courses.

32:50.640 --> 32:56.040
And I would say the first course is my favorite, because they're actually live interviews

32:56.040 --> 33:05.240
from Andrew and Jean, who's the founder of Coursera, and also who's like really good

33:05.240 --> 33:06.840
into TensorFlow 2.0.

33:06.840 --> 33:13.760
So I'm pretty inspired by him on the interviews inside the first course of the specialization.

33:13.760 --> 33:19.440
He is a very inspiring, very inspiring individual, like an interpreter in this field.

33:19.440 --> 33:20.440
Absolutely.

33:20.440 --> 33:25.480
You mentioned that you go into these courses, a lot of machine learning courses have a

33:25.480 --> 33:26.640
lot of math.

33:26.640 --> 33:30.640
Some of it is beyond your current ability.

33:30.640 --> 33:37.200
How do you approach a course so that you can get something out of it, even when there's

33:37.200 --> 33:40.360
potentially a lot that you don't understand?

33:40.360 --> 33:42.320
What's your approach there?

33:42.320 --> 33:49.760
Well, my approach to that would be basically, first of all, reviewing the lectures a lot,

33:49.760 --> 33:51.080
first of all.

33:51.080 --> 33:59.160
And second of all, if I don't know about the math behind it, I would try to basically learn

33:59.160 --> 34:05.080
at least how to implement it, basically implement it using some open-source packages, because

34:05.080 --> 34:11.720
there's always an open-source package for some sort of math for something in machine learning.

34:11.720 --> 34:14.560
So I would try to learn how to implement it.

34:14.560 --> 34:19.600
And basically from there on, after learning how to implement it, I would find some time

34:19.600 --> 34:24.480
later on to basically learn the math behind it.

34:24.480 --> 34:30.560
And what's an example of something that you initially, like you just couldn't get the

34:30.560 --> 34:38.320
math behind it, you hadn't seen it before, and you took this approach, and today you

34:38.320 --> 34:40.440
understand it because of that approach.

34:40.440 --> 34:47.440
Well, I'd say about the proportional integral derivative, ID.

34:47.440 --> 34:48.440
Okay.

34:48.440 --> 34:54.360
And I basically learned how to implement it in C++, and learned some of the math behind

34:54.360 --> 34:55.360
it.

34:55.360 --> 34:59.960
Because there's still a lot of math, there's still a lot of math that I still need to learn

34:59.960 --> 35:01.960
more about it.

35:01.960 --> 35:09.320
But right now, some of it already understand, and yeah, so it's always still learning.

35:09.320 --> 35:13.120
What parts do you understand now, what parts do you still not understand?

35:13.120 --> 35:20.880
So for example, the proportional part in the integral part, I understand, the derivative,

35:20.880 --> 35:25.840
I still don't know how to implement that one, and also in the math behind it.

35:25.840 --> 35:26.840
Okay.

35:26.840 --> 35:34.880
I'm always learning, I'm never sitting there like relaxing, I'm always learning, always

35:34.880 --> 35:37.680
improving every single day.

35:37.680 --> 35:45.760
And do you study math also, or what kinds of math do you study, or how do you study it?

35:45.760 --> 35:53.960
I study math, so right now currently on math, I'm studying, trying to study linear regression

35:53.960 --> 35:56.280
if I have the time from then.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.280
Okay.

35:57.280 --> 36:03.480
So I've found a bunch of great Yasi courses teaching on that particular subject.

36:03.480 --> 36:04.480
Okay.

36:04.480 --> 36:11.400
So all of this, this amazing study you're doing with machine learning, how do you balance

36:11.400 --> 36:18.040
it with like school and chores, and all the things that I'm imagining you also have

36:18.040 --> 36:19.040
to do?

36:19.040 --> 36:26.240
Well, I balance it, because first of all, the good thing about school is that they give

36:26.240 --> 36:28.480
like not a lot of homework.

36:28.480 --> 36:29.480
Okay.

36:29.480 --> 36:35.680
I can finish my homework in like five minutes, they don't give a lot of homework these

36:35.680 --> 36:36.680
days.

36:36.680 --> 36:37.680
Okay.

36:37.680 --> 36:42.240
And for my chores, I don't have a lot of chores, for example, I have to do is take the

36:42.240 --> 36:47.960
laundry, sometimes wash dishes, clean the table, sweep the floor, basically, those are

36:47.960 --> 36:48.960
my chores.

36:48.960 --> 36:55.560
And after completing them between school and all my chores, then I have free time to

36:55.560 --> 36:58.760
basically study more of machine learning.

36:58.760 --> 36:59.760
Got it.

36:59.760 --> 37:05.360
And I think you also have done some Kaggle competitions, what's your experience been

37:05.360 --> 37:06.360
there?

37:06.360 --> 37:07.360
How many of you done?

37:07.360 --> 37:10.560
So far, I've done 35 Kaggle competitions.

37:10.560 --> 37:11.560
35, wow.

37:11.560 --> 37:19.440
Although, sadly, I haven't won any medals on it, but I don't really care if I don't

37:19.440 --> 37:23.440
earn any medal or anything, because I think it's a really great learning opportunity

37:23.440 --> 37:24.440
for me.

37:24.440 --> 37:29.920
Because on Kaggle, I can actually learn from my mistakes and also learn from the people

37:29.920 --> 37:35.320
who actually won the competition, because after the competition, I go through the kernels

37:35.320 --> 37:38.360
and actually see how they implement their way of doing that.

37:38.360 --> 37:43.200
There's also another thing I got, although Kaggle, I learned stuff from it.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.600
There's also another thing I don't like about Kaggle.

37:45.600 --> 37:51.600
For example, in the free sound audio competition, which ended about three months ago.

37:51.600 --> 37:57.440
So I earned number one on the public leaderboard, and just one try.

37:57.440 --> 38:01.800
Although on the public leaderboard, I was like number one on the private leaderboard, I

38:01.800 --> 38:07.760
was like at the end, I'm like 393 and a 408 people.

38:07.760 --> 38:11.400
And you were doing the competition while it was still active?

38:11.400 --> 38:12.400
Yes.

38:12.400 --> 38:18.520
So I already submitted it before they merged from public to private.

38:18.520 --> 38:19.520
Okay.

38:19.520 --> 38:23.840
So I don't really like how they judge your competitions.

38:23.840 --> 38:27.840
They only release this little bit of test data set.

38:27.840 --> 38:33.440
But most of the test days that they don't release it, which I don't think is very fair.

38:33.440 --> 38:39.240
Just for example, someone who has a really bad model, I'm telling them basically thinking

38:39.240 --> 38:46.240
like go like top 100 or something on the private leaderboard, get your models like bad

38:46.240 --> 38:52.960
or something, or maybe good on the unshown portion of the test data set.

38:52.960 --> 38:56.720
So that's just one of the things they don't like about Kaggle.

38:56.720 --> 39:01.640
But in general, I'd say Kaggle is a great learning opportunity, and I'd recommend it

39:01.640 --> 39:02.640
for everyone.

39:02.640 --> 39:09.000
Oh, and I just forgot to mention, for people who are interested in learning, which you

39:09.000 --> 39:13.080
learned, but don't know where, go to Kaggle.com slash learning.

39:13.080 --> 39:16.680
Kaggle.com slash learning, good resource for getting started.

39:16.680 --> 39:17.680
Yep.

39:17.680 --> 39:19.720
There's good resources for learning Python.

39:19.720 --> 39:26.120
Also, there's also instructor called Alex, who's like a really good into machine learning.

39:26.120 --> 39:30.800
And she has a bunch of machine learning courses on Kaggle, free of charge.

39:30.800 --> 39:34.560
And also the content, I saw the content is really, really good.

39:34.560 --> 39:40.800
And also some of the courses were actually made with in partnership with like grandmasters

39:40.800 --> 39:41.800
on Kaggle.

39:41.800 --> 39:42.800
Nice.

39:42.800 --> 39:47.120
So what's your favorite type of machine learning?

39:47.120 --> 39:55.600
Well, it used to be super-wise learning, but now I definitely say reinforcement learning.

39:55.600 --> 39:56.600
Okay.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.400
And why do you like reinforcement learning?

39:58.400 --> 40:02.840
Well, I like reinforcement learning because you can basically do anything with it.

40:02.840 --> 40:08.080
For example, if you're training a robot and you're using machine learning for it, you

40:08.080 --> 40:09.280
don't need any data.

40:09.280 --> 40:15.280
So you just use reinforcement learning and the robot will learn from its trial and error.

40:15.280 --> 40:20.520
And after a trial and error, basically every single time is going to be like really good

40:20.520 --> 40:22.920
and still going to be improving every single day.

40:22.920 --> 40:26.720
So basically, you're just going to have to implement your model once and then you can sit

40:26.720 --> 40:33.960
back and relax while you see a robot doing this task that you told it to in your machine learning

40:33.960 --> 40:34.960
model.

40:34.960 --> 40:42.280
Do you know what the hard part of reinforcement learning is?

40:42.280 --> 40:46.280
Like figuring out what your cost function is, your optimization function.

40:46.280 --> 40:49.200
Do you get into that level of detail with it?

40:49.200 --> 40:50.200
Not yet.

40:50.200 --> 40:51.200
Okay.

40:51.200 --> 40:55.400
It's pretty awesome that you even know what it is though.

40:55.400 --> 40:58.760
Do you have a lot of friends who know what reinforcement learning is?

40:58.760 --> 40:59.760
Not a lot.

40:59.760 --> 41:04.360
There's not a lot of resources I'm learning reinforcement learning.

41:04.360 --> 41:09.840
So I think for reinforcement learning, you still need to learn more about it.

41:09.840 --> 41:13.320
There's a lot of stuff I don't know about reinforcement learning.

41:13.320 --> 41:15.800
Have you done any projects with it?

41:15.800 --> 41:19.880
So far, I've only done like two, I think, yet two.

41:19.880 --> 41:21.480
What were the projects?

41:21.480 --> 41:26.400
Which was basically finding good bananas in a simulated environment.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.480
So there's good bananas and bad bananas.

41:29.480 --> 41:30.480
Okay.

41:30.480 --> 41:37.680
Your task is to train an agent to basically find the good bananas and pick that up and

41:37.680 --> 41:45.000
put it into your basket of your good bananas and don't collect any bad bananas.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.600
That's the first project.

41:46.600 --> 41:52.520
And the second project I did was basically train an agent to play tennis, to play tennis

41:52.520 --> 41:54.720
with another train agent.

41:54.720 --> 41:57.400
Like pong or like real tennis or something.

41:57.400 --> 42:02.760
Basically, real tennis in a simulated environment, of course.

42:02.760 --> 42:06.240
So the simulated environment was provided by Unity.

42:06.240 --> 42:09.200
So you only have to train your agent.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.720
The other agent is provided by Unity.

42:11.720 --> 42:14.880
So you only train one agent and there's two agents in the game.

42:14.880 --> 42:19.880
So the other agent is provided by the Unity app.

42:19.880 --> 42:23.360
Well, this has been such a fun conversation.

42:23.360 --> 42:28.840
It's so exciting to hear about all the amazing things you've been doing, learning about machine

42:28.840 --> 42:29.840
learning and AI.

42:29.840 --> 42:33.920
Are there any other things that you want to be sure to share with us?

42:33.920 --> 42:42.560
I was also say after my radacity network program, I was also really thrilled and honored

42:42.560 --> 42:52.720
to be invited by Lawrence Morty at Google's TensorFlow team because I came the youngest

42:52.720 --> 42:57.200
TensorFlow contributor and I basically changed the re-mean.

42:57.200 --> 43:01.520
But most of the re-mean on TensorFlow's GitHub page was written by me.

43:01.520 --> 43:04.720
So I tweeted it out on Twitter after I verified that.

43:04.720 --> 43:09.360
It was like 300 likes and 30,000 impressions on the first thing.

43:09.360 --> 43:15.600
So basically, Lawrence Morty, who's the developer advocate for the Google's TensorFlow

43:15.600 --> 43:21.120
project, basically invited me to Google's TensorFlow team to basically learn the inside

43:21.120 --> 43:27.920
and out of how they develop TensorFlow and also have a chitchat on the future of TensorFlow.

43:27.920 --> 43:35.360
I'm also recently been really honored to be invited by Cruz to Cruz headquarters.

43:35.360 --> 43:41.800
So in case you don't know, Cruz is basically a self-driving car company and is based in

43:41.800 --> 43:42.800
San Francisco.

43:42.800 --> 43:49.480
Yeah, I actually interviewed the head of machine learning and AI at Cruz at a conference

43:49.480 --> 43:51.880
that I recently did, very, very cool guy.

43:51.880 --> 43:52.880
You should listen to that interview.

43:52.880 --> 43:56.320
In the twin AI conference?

43:56.320 --> 43:58.120
That the Twomalcon conference, yep.

43:58.120 --> 43:59.120
I see.

43:59.120 --> 44:06.840
So, Cruz basically got to be a bunch of really smart engineers and talked about how they

44:06.840 --> 44:14.880
developed their filtering cars and also about how they create their hardware and their

44:14.880 --> 44:15.880
sensors.

44:15.880 --> 44:16.880
Okay.

44:16.880 --> 44:20.120
And overall, I think it was a really great learning opportunity for me.

44:20.120 --> 44:21.120
Awesome.

44:21.120 --> 44:26.440
You know, I forgot to, I can't believe I almost forgot to mention is you've also founded

44:26.440 --> 44:34.320
a whole bunch of companies, Firebolt, Firebolt Space Agency, Dopey Lopey and Snap Auto.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.120
What are these companies?

44:36.120 --> 44:39.480
So I don't work on Dopey Lopey or Firebolt Space Agency anymore.

44:39.480 --> 44:40.480
Okay.

44:40.480 --> 44:43.760
So right now, I'm only focusing on Firebolt Inc and Snap Auto.

44:43.760 --> 44:51.120
Firebolt Inc is a machine learning slash AI company that basically does machine learning

44:51.120 --> 44:52.120
for humans.

44:52.120 --> 44:56.920
So, he uses machine learning to improve human lives.

44:56.920 --> 45:04.080
Example of one of the projects I'm working on in Firebolt is called Project Aurora, which

45:04.080 --> 45:10.160
is scheduled to be the first beta version is scheduled to be released in around July

45:10.160 --> 45:11.160
of 2022.

45:11.160 --> 45:19.000
So, Project Aurora is basically a way of online website, which I'm developing right now,

45:19.000 --> 45:22.560
but where you, it can predict cancer.

45:22.560 --> 45:27.560
So, for example, if you don't know if you have skin cancer or not, take a photo of that

45:27.560 --> 45:32.160
piece of skin that you think that might have skin cancer and upload it to Project Aurora's

45:32.160 --> 45:33.160
website.

45:33.160 --> 45:38.040
And then it can tell you if you have skin cancer or not, this is one of the things that

45:38.040 --> 45:46.520
we're getting at Firebolt and Snap Auto is basically a company which focuses on autonomous

45:46.520 --> 45:47.520
stuff.

45:47.520 --> 45:48.520
Anything that's autonomous.

45:48.520 --> 45:49.520
Okay.

45:49.520 --> 45:54.480
For example, flying cars, autonomous vehicles, robotics, anything that's autonomous because

45:54.480 --> 45:58.120
I love autonomous stuff.

45:58.120 --> 46:02.560
And do you, is it kind of just you working on this or do you have a team working with

46:02.560 --> 46:03.560
you on these companies?

46:03.560 --> 46:08.020
On Snap Auto, I'm the only person because not a lot of people know self-driving cars,

46:08.020 --> 46:09.520
flying cars, or robotics.

46:09.520 --> 46:10.520
Okay.

46:10.520 --> 46:11.520
Which is a problem.

46:11.520 --> 46:12.520
Uh-huh.

46:12.520 --> 46:13.520
Absolutely.

46:13.520 --> 46:22.520
But for Firebolt, a corporation, I have a team, but I have my dad, me, and also one of

46:22.520 --> 46:23.520
my friends.

46:23.520 --> 46:24.520
Very cool.

46:24.520 --> 46:25.520
Very cool.

46:25.520 --> 46:26.520
Thank you.

46:26.520 --> 46:31.320
