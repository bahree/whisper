Hello and welcome to another episode of Twomletalk, the podcast why interview interesting people,

01:20.480 --> 01:25.840
doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I'm your host

01:25.840 --> 01:35.320
Sam Charington.

01:35.320 --> 01:40.160
For those interested in our fast.ai study group, but who haven't been able to make it to our

01:40.160 --> 01:46.720
live sessions, make sure you check out our recap videos via either the meetup page or our

01:46.720 --> 01:54.440
YouTube channel at youtube.com slash twomlai.

01:54.440 --> 02:00.400
In this episode, I'm joined by Jillian McCann, head of cloud engineering and AI at Workgrid

02:00.400 --> 02:05.200
software, which offers an intelligent workplace assistant that integrates with a variety

02:05.200 --> 02:10.380
of business tools and systems. In our discussion, which focuses on work

02:10.380 --> 02:16.040
grid use of cloud based AI services, Jillian details some of the underlying systems that

02:16.040 --> 02:22.120
make work grid tick, including a breakdown of its conversational interface. We also take

02:22.120 --> 02:26.960
a look at their engineering pipeline and how they build high quality systems that depend

02:26.960 --> 02:33.820
upon external APIs. Finally, Jillian shares her view on some of the factors that contribute

02:33.820 --> 02:40.720
to misunderstandings and impatience on the part of users of AI based products. And now on

02:40.720 --> 02:49.540
to the show, all right, everyone, I am on the line with Jillian McCann. Jillian is head

02:49.540 --> 02:55.360
of cloud engineering and AI at Workgrid software. Jillian, welcome to this weekend machine learning

02:55.360 --> 02:56.360
in AI.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.080
Thank you. Thanks for having me.

02:58.080 --> 03:02.440
It's great to have you on the show. Why don't we get started out by having you tell us

03:02.440 --> 03:07.800
a little bit about your background and how you got involved in AI?

03:07.800 --> 03:14.360
Yes, so I have been working. I'm an engineer at Harvard, really. I've been working very

03:14.360 --> 03:19.920
much in the public cloud space last couple of years. But recently, I've started to look

03:19.920 --> 03:27.520
at how we can use conversational AI. Specifically, I write chatbots and voice within the employee

03:27.520 --> 03:35.440
space. So I have Workgrid software is a wholly owned company of Liberty Mutual Insurance.

03:35.440 --> 03:41.120
And what we've done there is a lot of the great products that we've built internally

03:41.120 --> 03:46.920
for employees that have used different aspects of conversational AI. We've decided that

03:46.920 --> 03:52.120
it solved a lot of problems for us within the enterprise within a large global company

03:52.120 --> 03:59.200
that there is potential there to create a product that can be used across companies worldwide.

03:59.200 --> 04:05.360
So last year, we created that company that's separate and today, and that's now my focus.

04:05.360 --> 04:11.680
It's cloud engineering and AI. And it's really how you can apply artificial intelligence

04:11.680 --> 04:14.760
within employee focused products.

04:14.760 --> 04:18.840
Can you give some examples of the types of employee focused products that you're working

04:18.840 --> 04:19.840
on there?

04:19.840 --> 04:25.520
Yes, so our initial product is called the Workgrid Assistant. And the aim of that is really

04:25.520 --> 04:30.600
like building an intelligent workplace assistant. You know, not everybody is fortunate enough

04:30.600 --> 04:35.920
to have PA, you know, a person who is able to, you know, take notes for them or create

04:35.920 --> 04:41.360
them to do lists. So we're looking for a way to create, you know, a product that can

04:41.360 --> 04:49.440
really help employees, you know, with productivity gains and engagement and job satisfaction.

04:49.440 --> 04:55.640
And some of the care is that the product we have, you know, focuses on its, you know, approvals

04:55.640 --> 05:01.360
and workflows and really automation and the aggregation of a lot of internal systems

05:01.360 --> 05:07.040
in that one place with a really, you know, modern and intelligent intuitive interface

05:07.040 --> 05:13.400
of which includes, you know, a chatbot. So conversation, conversational interface is

05:13.400 --> 05:20.000
part of this as well, which is really where our initial focus of AI is.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.720
So I mean, some of the use cases that we talk about. So as I say, this is Stan from, you

05:24.720 --> 05:29.840
know, work with them within Liberty Mutual is that we really focus on some of our site's

05:29.840 --> 05:36.440
central employee functions like HR, IT help desk, just general product evidence and how

05:36.440 --> 05:44.480
we can, you know, automate and provide also like a conversation interface to many systems

05:44.480 --> 05:48.720
so that, you know, employees can find the information they need when they need it, you

05:48.720 --> 05:53.920
know, on the questions that are asked across offices day and day out, can be very simply

05:53.920 --> 05:58.480
automated and give them, you know, again, that engaging experience.

05:58.480 --> 06:04.960
And is work grid primarily building software for the use of Liberty Mutual or are you,

06:04.960 --> 06:09.240
you know, is it more like a spin out where you're commercializing this for the broader

06:09.240 --> 06:10.240
marketplace?

06:10.240 --> 06:16.280
It's the commercialization, really, of a product that we built internally for ourselves.

06:16.280 --> 06:17.280
Okay.

06:17.280 --> 06:20.880
It's actually getting back several years ago, you know, we went through a transformation,

06:20.880 --> 06:26.040
I think around 2014. When we looked at the marketplace, we didn't see anything there

06:26.040 --> 06:31.160
that really would, you know, benefit us in the way that we wanted, we wanted to bring

06:31.160 --> 06:35.760
all our underlying enterprise systems in tools that, you know, we used day and day out.

06:35.760 --> 06:41.320
And I could give it and give a simple place for people to go and do their daily work,

06:41.320 --> 06:45.120
you know, so instead of going into many different applications, where you've literally just

06:45.120 --> 06:49.720
gone in success screen to click a few buttons, it just brings that one place that you can

06:49.720 --> 06:51.520
actually achieve your daily work.

06:51.520 --> 06:59.560
And we evolved that, you know, when last year into building into part of it as a chatbot,

06:59.560 --> 07:05.000
which is, you know, it's a conversation like, and it's using like natural language processing

07:05.000 --> 07:11.120
and conversation analytics to really, you know, try to find what our employees and pin

07:11.120 --> 07:14.720
points are and also to help automate some of that.

07:14.720 --> 07:22.360
And what's been the adoption like of the chatbot interface in particular, there's, there's

07:22.360 --> 07:28.280
an article recently, it was in Ink magazine and it was an article with a guy who was like

07:28.280 --> 07:33.240
founder of a startup and the headline of the article was something like chat box killed

07:33.240 --> 07:34.880
my company or killed my startup.

07:34.880 --> 07:39.720
And the idea was that like he built his startup around this, you know, what he now sees

07:39.720 --> 07:44.640
as a fad and he found that people really didn't want to use chatbots.

07:44.640 --> 07:50.320
And so I've been asking folks ever since seeing that about conversational interfaces like,

07:50.320 --> 07:55.320
where do they think, you know, where do you think we are in terms of adoption or and

07:55.320 --> 08:00.280
is this a way that people want to engage with software?

08:00.280 --> 08:01.800
What have you seen?

08:01.800 --> 08:07.160
So I would say chatbots to me are, you know, the future.

08:07.160 --> 08:09.640
When I say that, what do I mean by a chatbot?

08:09.640 --> 08:14.360
I think everybody has different perceptions of what a chatbot is, you know, is it a simple

08:14.360 --> 08:18.680
bot you order flour so I'm on Facebook Messenger or is it Alexa?

08:18.680 --> 08:24.560
It's literally, you know, the definition is like your ability to talk to and machine

08:24.560 --> 08:26.600
to natural language.

08:26.600 --> 08:31.480
So we do have, you know, on many levels of that, if you know what I mean.

08:31.480 --> 08:38.560
So I say it's very much voice is the future, future interface.

08:38.560 --> 08:44.720
So we talk about chatbots, that's what I have in my head, but it does make sense in a lot

08:44.720 --> 08:45.720
of different contexts.

08:45.720 --> 08:51.200
But it also, you know, it doesn't mean you have to have one sometimes as a visual interface

08:51.200 --> 08:52.200
works better.

08:52.200 --> 08:57.800
So it's not like everybody has to rush out and build a chatbot, but I think everybody

08:57.800 --> 09:04.000
should consider when the conversation interface actually works better, you know, very much,

09:04.000 --> 09:09.720
you know, like the one we have you sitting at your desk, you want to ask a simple question,

09:09.720 --> 09:13.760
maybe about an HR policy or you want to get some information about how do we have like

09:13.760 --> 09:19.160
reset passwords from the IT health desk, we do valor, how about two seconds chat with

09:19.160 --> 09:24.760
a chatbot or a ten minute phone call, so people are, it's the use case that really drives

09:24.760 --> 09:26.440
the use of the chatbot.

09:26.440 --> 09:33.280
So we have, you know, it's still in, I would say it's like an evolving technology, but

09:33.280 --> 09:38.840
it's not really the end of your AI piece that's evolving, it's the use case, understanding

09:38.840 --> 09:45.640
when that context or when that conversation interface makes more sense, and also the actual

09:45.640 --> 09:50.480
piece of the conversation design, what does the chatbot say?

09:50.480 --> 09:56.720
If you don't design it well, the conversation doesn't flow well, and then chatbots do fail,

09:56.720 --> 10:00.360
you know, it flows a lot more than just the AI piece it is.

10:00.360 --> 10:05.600
I think good conversation design, good understanding of your users and understanding the benefits

10:05.600 --> 10:10.680
it this will bring, and then also as I say, you know, the evolution of chatbots into

10:10.680 --> 10:15.600
a voice, I definitely think, I mean, you can just, I don't know if you're seeing the

10:15.600 --> 10:20.760
figures of, you know, hi, many Alexa's, we're bought a Chris's, you know, so there's

10:20.760 --> 10:25.800
like, I think there's staff like one in sex, American high schools, have a smart speaker,

10:25.800 --> 10:30.040
you know, so you think about that, those are all chatbots.

10:30.040 --> 10:35.880
In the definition of, you know, using natural language to talk, you know, interface with

10:35.880 --> 10:36.880
computers.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.120
So, don't have that answer to your question.

10:39.120 --> 10:46.000
Yeah, no, it does, I appreciate that broader definition of chatbot, and I think, you

10:46.000 --> 10:51.120
know, when we vision kind of the future of human computer interaction, I don't think

10:51.120 --> 10:57.640
that there's much of a question for most people that it's a natural language-based conversation

10:57.640 --> 11:02.720
that, you know, extends beyond kind of the, you know, like the example you gave, the

11:02.720 --> 11:08.200
Facebook messenger bot, it's not so much that, you know, that rectangular interface that

11:08.200 --> 11:14.400
defines chatbot, but this means of interacting with the computer via natural language.

11:14.400 --> 11:24.000
You mentioned that the first step is understanding when to apply this type of approach to a given

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
use case.

11:25.000 --> 11:29.040
Do you have any guidelines that tell you when, or is it kind of, I'll know it when I see

11:29.040 --> 11:30.040
it?

11:30.040 --> 11:34.200
I think it's a bit of both, like really, some use cases just don't make sense.

11:34.200 --> 11:42.120
You know, I think about things that, you know, that you're used to seeing, like, lists

11:42.120 --> 11:47.200
of things, like, something that's very visual, if that makes sense, you know, like, we

11:47.200 --> 11:53.400
talk about, like, if you were to ask about all the, for example, like, the Amazon days

11:53.400 --> 11:57.240
of the day, you know, you know, the way you see everything's like cards, there's a lot

11:57.240 --> 12:02.800
of visual input that you can take, you can ask that in a chatbot, what, how could you

12:02.800 --> 12:05.280
get that sort of information in the same way?

12:05.280 --> 12:10.000
You know, it just be a big list of words that it doesn't really make sense.

12:10.000 --> 12:14.360
But, you know, we have find, like, with the employee space, it has been, like, really

12:14.360 --> 12:19.240
listening to what employees are asked for, or some of the things are just, like, very

12:19.240 --> 12:26.600
simple, one-off sort of actions, or, like, require, so you do find a lot of, of the use

12:26.600 --> 12:30.920
cases within the work, basically, to be centered around a more intelligent search, you

12:30.920 --> 12:36.760
know, actually, we know we'll have more direction into more directed questions, really, than

12:36.760 --> 12:40.040
just, you know, type it in a search bar.

12:40.040 --> 12:44.440
So, you know, essentially, we just have worked through them and decided, like, what makes

12:44.440 --> 12:45.440
sense?

12:45.440 --> 12:46.440
What doesn't make sense?

12:46.440 --> 12:51.040
I do think there is a, especially in some of the arguments on, like, you do realize

12:51.040 --> 12:57.680
that the user's expectations are sometimes, like, very, there will be very high, they're

12:57.680 --> 13:02.640
very high, when you start talking about, um, any form of AI, and I don't know if you've

13:02.640 --> 13:09.760
come across this, it's like, it's either very high or low, um, this is not a success.

13:09.760 --> 13:17.160
So, like, from a chat board perspective, um, like, I think we've had an education ourselves,

13:17.160 --> 13:22.520
you know, we have, like, like, the development team, and, and the guys really, like, how do

13:22.520 --> 13:27.280
you build, like, intense and utterances and fulfilments and train the model?

13:27.280 --> 13:32.600
What technologies do you use, do you build your own, do you use somebody else's, um, you

13:32.600 --> 13:36.520
know, so there's a lot of that, but, like, when we're talking with the users, it's, it's

13:36.520 --> 13:40.760
like an expectation that it's all going to magically, like, it's magic.

13:40.760 --> 13:46.200
If you type something in, um, you know, like, what's the weather, that the chat bottle

13:46.200 --> 13:50.240
know how to answer it, and there's a sort of explanation, well, guys, it's still cold,

13:50.240 --> 13:55.120
we still have to write that if you want a chat box to actually know the weather, we have

13:55.120 --> 13:59.680
to program, we have to train the model, and we have to ultimately call an API that tells

13:59.680 --> 14:04.200
us what the weather is, but it's, it's that perception of, like, if I repeatedly ask

14:04.200 --> 14:08.600
it what the weather is, it'll learn that we've heard that, like, it'll learn what I say,

14:08.600 --> 14:11.600
says, well, they'll not learn until we update it.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.920
It's not a magical box, it just learns things.

14:14.920 --> 14:19.800
So I think there's, like, the expectations, if that makes sense, it's being very interesting

14:19.800 --> 14:20.800
to see.

14:20.800 --> 14:26.960
And then on the other side is, you know, people just think that they're not very good,

14:26.960 --> 14:32.240
chat box aren't very good, the L&U is not very good, but we're sort of in a place

14:32.240 --> 14:36.000
where it's never been any better, and it's only going to get better.

14:36.000 --> 14:40.680
So, you know, I think what we find also is the very importance of, like, what we call

14:40.680 --> 14:46.640
conversational analytics in that you're understanding what it's being, and you're understanding

14:46.640 --> 14:51.440
what the box saying, or what's being said to the box, box, you know, you may not be able

14:51.440 --> 14:55.640
to answer, but if everybody's asking for what's the weather, then potentially that's the

14:55.640 --> 14:56.640
feature you add.

14:56.640 --> 15:03.880
And so, you know, just that, analytics of what's being said, missed audiences, missed intents,

15:03.880 --> 15:09.680
how well are you fulfilling the actual user intent, how well are you performing, and that's

15:09.680 --> 15:15.920
really a driven user case as to just refine what we have, because it is a great way if

15:15.920 --> 15:22.000
you, you know, give the box to like a pilot group, you know, you can actually through what

15:22.000 --> 15:26.040
they're asking and how they're chatting to it, actually see maybe what they wanted to

15:26.040 --> 15:27.040
do.

15:27.040 --> 15:32.040
And it does surprise you in some ways, and also the realisation that, you know, different

15:32.040 --> 15:35.520
cultures and different language of different ways of even saying hello.

15:35.520 --> 15:39.720
So, we find all that, like, if we've ruled it out, it's still in the pilot, but in the

15:39.720 --> 15:45.200
Liberty Mutual, you know, we see that because it's a global component, but it's been very

15:45.200 --> 15:46.200
interesting.

15:46.200 --> 15:52.640
And I do think chatbots, if they're designed well, they perform real actions are very powerful.

15:52.640 --> 16:00.200
Do you feel that the, this magic that some users expect, where the chatbot is going to

16:00.200 --> 16:07.480
learn how to understand what the user is asking, do you feel that that is just kind of organic

16:07.480 --> 16:14.600
or does it, has it come about because we throw around terms like machine learning that people

16:14.600 --> 16:15.600
don't really understand?

16:15.600 --> 16:16.600
I would, yes.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.600
That's right.

16:17.600 --> 16:19.600
In short, yes.

16:19.600 --> 16:28.240
And I think AI, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, you know, there's

16:28.240 --> 16:30.040
a lot of words about need about it.

16:30.040 --> 16:36.280
And I do think there is, you know, if we say machine learning that somehow it's going

16:36.280 --> 16:40.040
to learn how to do these things, but like when you, you know, and I'm not an expert,

16:40.040 --> 16:44.920
you know, but I've read some stuff, you know, the differences between supervised and unsupervised

16:44.920 --> 16:49.760
machine learning and deep learning is different for is that when she start getting into it,

16:49.760 --> 16:57.240
it is much more evolved, you know, the data that you have, the training data, it can only,

16:57.240 --> 17:02.840
it can only be as good as the data you have and the historical data for supervised learning.

17:02.840 --> 17:07.280
So I don't think everybody really, you know, they don't need to know that, but I think,

17:07.280 --> 17:11.680
um, like once you start having an interest in it, then you do start reading these things,

17:11.680 --> 17:17.640
you do get a better awareness of it, but I doubt I think, yeah, the terms and just everything

17:17.640 --> 17:22.600
has got some element of AI apparently, I don't know, you know, there's a lot of products

17:22.600 --> 17:23.600
say that.

17:23.600 --> 17:29.720
And we need to dive into, I think a lot of it is really automation and workflow and

17:29.720 --> 17:37.840
the real great things, but I think, you know, there's a bit of a buzz, as you know, um, and

17:37.840 --> 17:41.440
it's applied when potentially it's not, it's not our first intelligence, something else.

17:41.440 --> 17:48.480
So, you know, I say some great, the script product center and a lot of it, you know, it seems

17:48.480 --> 17:52.800
more like process automation, which is very valuable to.

17:52.800 --> 17:59.520
Yeah, basically every enterprise software product is some automation, some more slow automation.

17:59.520 --> 18:01.160
Uh, underneath, right?

18:01.160 --> 18:02.160
All right.

18:02.160 --> 18:09.440
So, you've, you've got some use case, you think it could be a good fit for some type of

18:09.440 --> 18:16.840
chatbot, then the, the next question is, how do you get there, uh, and you were speaking

18:16.840 --> 18:23.280
at the AWS conference, so you went the cloud direction, there's also, um, you know, building

18:23.280 --> 18:29.200
your own, how did you evaluate the, the different options and come to the conclusion that you came

18:29.200 --> 18:30.200
to?

18:30.200 --> 18:31.200
Yeah.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.200
So, that's a good question.

18:32.200 --> 18:38.000
Um, so I did look at a lot of different options, um, I think really, you know, the first

18:38.000 --> 18:44.160
thing was, and it's written general about chatbot, I think you have to think about where

18:44.160 --> 18:47.960
are the channels or the clients that you want to put that chatbot in, you know, who's

18:47.960 --> 18:48.960
the customer?

18:48.960 --> 18:53.480
Is it a, like a customer facing, or is it an internal one that, like more like the employee

18:53.480 --> 18:58.000
stuff that I have been working on, you know, just an understanding of generally what

18:58.000 --> 19:03.600
the chatbot, um, is going to do, but also those channels, because a lot of the, like the

19:03.600 --> 19:08.360
channels have their built-in frameworks that really make it easier to build.

19:08.360 --> 19:12.320
Um, I think, you know, if you're thinking about building chatbots, you have to set your

19:12.320 --> 19:19.320
development capabilities as well, like I was like, um, I'm working from a, like an architect,

19:19.320 --> 19:23.360
engineer, you know, I know how to write code, solutions are not going to put me off, but

19:23.360 --> 19:26.680
if you're just in general interested by chatbots, there are a lot of great frameworks out

19:26.680 --> 19:28.480
there that can get you up and running.

19:28.480 --> 19:34.440
Um, I obviously then, um, some of the research we did is into, well, understands what type

19:34.440 --> 19:37.600
of chatbot you're trying to build, so you know, and there is a framework, you can sort

19:37.600 --> 19:43.640
of assess it against an open-demand chatbot, versus a close-demand chatbot, um, close-demand

19:43.640 --> 19:51.080
is, um, a lot easier in that it's like a very set purpose, as I mentioned, order floors

19:51.080 --> 19:56.680
or, um, order of pizza order attacks, so those types of chatbots are a lot simpler, because

19:56.680 --> 20:02.440
they're only expected to do one thing, and if you started to ask a pizza bot about the

20:02.440 --> 20:08.840
politics, you're not really expecting that to do what I mean, just expectations, um, but

20:08.840 --> 20:13.240
what we were working in was more open-demand in that there's a wide range of questions

20:13.240 --> 20:19.320
that an employee in a large company can ask, even within HR or IT help desk, um, use cases.

20:19.320 --> 20:24.440
So, you know, we looked, we need to find something then that would help us build, um, a more

20:24.440 --> 20:30.080
open-demand chatbot, um, and then also, you know, we're not really into the differences,

20:30.080 --> 20:34.440
so the difference between, like, retrieval and generative, you know, most chatbots in

20:34.440 --> 20:39.560
production today are retrieval-based, um, like, a generative one is, you know, we're really

20:39.560 --> 20:45.200
arguing into, you know, um, absolute true artificial intelligence in that, you know, something

20:45.200 --> 20:49.520
like, like, it didn't go very well, Microsoft, hey, but they've built, you know, the chatbot

20:49.520 --> 20:55.920
itself is generating a response, first is retrieval-based, um, and retrieval-based is obviously

20:55.920 --> 21:01.360
in a professional workplace, um, you know, it's, it's the thing that we initially, you

21:01.360 --> 21:05.600
know, we need to deliver that, so you can't really start looking at how can I build chatbots

21:05.600 --> 21:11.440
going to, you know, come up with the answers itself, you know, that's out the rounds of the,

21:11.440 --> 21:18.160
uh, AI capabilities of where we are today, from what company perspective I would say, um,

21:18.160 --> 21:24.800
but then I looked at, um, so, you know, we wanted a, um, a natural language chatbot rather

21:24.800 --> 21:31.440
than, like, a command, sort of, you know, do this, do that, um, so we want the natural language,

21:31.440 --> 21:39.280
looked at, um, the main cloud providers, I suppose, we say Google Microsoft Amazon, um, so,

21:39.280 --> 21:46.880
you know, I, um, an AWS Cloud Architects, I asked lightly by this towards one, but, um, we did,

21:46.880 --> 21:52.560
I did look at, um, Microsoft's cognitive services, a really great Google's, um, you know,

21:52.560 --> 21:58.480
there's some great stuff there, but with Amazon, an AWS was what was chosen, because it's more than,

21:58.480 --> 22:05.520
it takes more than an LU to build a chatbot for thousands of people. It takes, um, many different

22:05.520 --> 22:11.440
services and capabilities, um, you know, AWS was our provider of choice at that time,

22:11.440 --> 22:17.360
so it really made sense just to, you know, work with them and pack a technology that sort of

22:17.360 --> 22:23.680
fitted that AWS ecosystem, and luckily enough, um, it's not last year of the year before

22:23.680 --> 22:30.880
they announced Amazon Lex, um, as a new service, uh, in preview, um, immediately that was the

22:30.880 --> 22:35.840
ones at the end we wanted to work with, um, and we partnered really with them to develop,

22:35.840 --> 22:39.920
you know, they were in preview to develop the capabilities that we needed, um,

22:39.920 --> 22:44.960
I must say it worked really well because it's more than AWS Lex, the builds it, it's,

22:44.960 --> 22:50.080
it's a wide range of the services, um, it gives us that real scale ability, um,

22:50.080 --> 22:53.360
on analytics and good engineering practices.

22:53.360 --> 22:59.120
What have been some of the things that you've needed to build around it to arrive at a complete

22:59.120 --> 23:05.760
solution? Yeah, so interesting. I thought that was really what the, um, the session, uh,

23:05.760 --> 23:13.440
re-embed was, but like the last year was, it's more than Alexa. Um, so, so, I mean, what we had to

23:13.440 --> 23:19.680
provide was really, um, I think the analytics was very important, you know, been able to, um,

23:19.680 --> 23:28.800
analyze and store, um, elements of conversation so we could get insights, um, we use like APIs,

23:28.800 --> 23:37.520
um, and storage, um, so that we actually can, you know, um, review conversations. Um, so,

23:37.520 --> 23:44.480
we essentially built an architecture serverless architecture around Alexa. Um, so Alexa provided

23:44.480 --> 23:50.640
the NLU, um, but then also like if we wanted to, it's initially we focused on, um,

23:51.600 --> 23:55.360
text chatbot, but obviously then voice, as they mentioned, you know, obviously,

23:55.360 --> 24:02.720
as a, as a, the next step. So, you know, using AWS Poly, um, to really, you know, have both

24:02.720 --> 24:10.160
experiment with both, and then as we move into, you know, really looking at the devices in the

24:10.160 --> 24:15.680
home. I said beside her is the Google Assistant, um, which I have started looking at too. So,

24:15.680 --> 24:20.000
there's really powerful technology out there, um, and it's just, you know, as I said,

24:20.000 --> 24:27.360
taking the things that worked for you, um, and ultimately AWS, um, ecosystem was very

24:27.360 --> 24:32.560
much in place for us. So, so the, the lacks was the extra piece and once they, they brought that

24:32.560 --> 24:37.760
out, that seemed to definitely make sense. Um, and then, you know, as I said, we're talking

24:37.760 --> 24:43.680
at re-invent. Some of the things to talk about re-invent wasn't really, um, you know, the AI aspect

24:43.680 --> 24:50.880
offer, it was, how do you build chatbot scale? How do you test the chatbot? How do you have

24:50.880 --> 24:57.280
CI, CD pipelines for chatbots? Um, so it was really about good engineering practices applied to,

24:58.080 --> 25:03.760
um, like new technology like this. And also very importantly, I'm asking the before, is the

25:03.760 --> 25:09.200
conversation design, you know, what does it say? How does it interact with you? You know,

25:09.200 --> 25:14.320
you want to give your users a very good experience. Um, and what you have really have to do is just

25:14.320 --> 25:20.640
between the team is, you know, talk it out, script it out, um, potentially the bot. Um, so it's

25:20.640 --> 25:29.120
actually quite fun. Um, it's a fun way to develop. But, um, you can definitely see that it's a scale

25:29.120 --> 25:34.480
that, you know, we've had to build within a small team. Um, but I definitely have to say voice, um,

25:34.480 --> 25:40.720
the centerpiece, um, you know, it's a capability that we need to grow, um, just in general, I'd say within

25:40.720 --> 25:46.240
the engineering community. How big is your team now? So work red software, nice. So the original

25:46.240 --> 25:52.560
living neutral team was four or five work red software. No, we have, um, see boy, year or nine,

25:52.560 --> 25:58.160
so slightly bigger. But as I say, the conversation layout is just one piece of that. It's a larger

25:58.160 --> 26:04.240
assistant. Um, so we're all working hard, um, to really bring this because I really, I mean, we do

26:04.240 --> 26:08.960
honestly believe that, you know, you should value your employees, you should value their time,

26:09.840 --> 26:14.960
um, and you'd really try and help them, um, you know, when they need to have, when they've

26:14.960 --> 26:19.440
questions, they need answers, you can answer them quickly. But also, you know, providing that one

26:19.440 --> 26:24.880
place to go so they can do their, you know, to do this, notifications, provokes all those things

26:24.880 --> 26:31.920
that are a day-to-day, um, hassle sometimes, but you still have to do them. Um, you mentioned

26:31.920 --> 26:37.600
analytics on a number of occasions. Can you talk a little bit about the analytics that you use,

26:37.600 --> 26:44.960
and, um, what frameworks or tooling you've built to, um, support the way you want to analyze the

26:44.960 --> 26:53.120
conversations? Yeah, so, um, so I was at the moment, I've classified them as, um, quite well,

26:53.120 --> 26:58.880
standard analytics with the plan for more improved insights. So now let's have at the moment,

26:59.520 --> 27:06.960
so we're using, um, things like Amazon's, Elasticsearch, and Athena, um, to give us,

27:06.960 --> 27:11.120
you know, real time, so it's in real time that we can actually see, so the key things are in

27:11.120 --> 27:18.800
chat, what is the, um, the conversation flow, um, they missed other answers, and missed intense,

27:18.800 --> 27:26.480
where that terminology is, if you're not aware, um, like if you say something like book me a meeting

27:26.480 --> 27:31.600
with Gillian McCann, and it goes, sorry, I didn't understand, and it repeatedly says that is that,

27:31.600 --> 27:37.200
that we haven't modeled that conversation within the chat box. So we're going to say, you know,

27:37.200 --> 27:42.880
what people are asking that doesn't match, or what we actually find more important was,

27:42.880 --> 27:48.960
miss, we call them mismatch intense, it did match something, but it matched the wrong thing. So,

27:48.960 --> 27:54.720
you're trying to book a meeting, and it's given you the cafe menu, so, yeah, just, so this,

27:54.720 --> 28:00.080
so it's, it's the, to me, that's the performance of lags, the performance of the analytics itself,

28:00.080 --> 28:06.000
how well have we created, um, the model, what sample utterances have we provided, is something

28:06.000 --> 28:12.160
we can train, are people say things in a different way than you actually expected? So then we,

28:12.160 --> 28:16.240
we see those, we're able to say that, and we're able to, you know, bring that back into the

28:16.240 --> 28:22.480
lags model and immediately retrain it, um, but then we have analytics on more, I'd say, for me,

28:22.480 --> 28:29.920
you search, you search context, sort of like, um, very high level, you know, job roles or location,

28:29.920 --> 28:34.880
it's your specific questions are coming from a specific office, you know, that maybe you'll help

28:34.880 --> 28:42.000
you get insights into, well, what is the problem there, I'm not here, why are they asking that? Um, so,

28:42.000 --> 28:46.800
that's the, um, that's where we're at the moment, I also say to me, it was quite standard stuff,

28:46.800 --> 28:54.400
but with the plan to be more involved, um, where really it gets into what I call the key thing in

28:54.400 --> 29:00.560
any conversation is context, right? So the context, and we have different levels of context,

29:00.560 --> 29:07.280
um, at the moment it would be things like the user, like the office, location, um, job role,

29:07.280 --> 29:13.200
um, how does that context impact the answer or the conversation? So really, when I talk about

29:13.200 --> 29:18.960
a personal assistant, you want it personalized to you, so it understands, you know, you,

29:18.960 --> 29:24.400
so context from a user perspective, um, then context also could include the device that you're

29:24.400 --> 29:31.520
on, and the capabilities that it has, um, and then getting into what I like to call, it's like

29:31.520 --> 29:38.320
the short term and the long term memory, the conversational context, um, where we can understand,

29:38.320 --> 29:42.640
you know, what you've previously said is in this conversation, there's nothing worse than somebody

29:42.640 --> 29:46.640
you say, something to somebody in that two minutes later, they can completely say the same thing

29:46.640 --> 29:50.960
and ask the same question again, they haven't remembered what you said, so it's really, you know,

29:50.960 --> 29:57.520
how do we tree in the chat box to not be annoying like that? So look, you know, in that example,

29:57.520 --> 30:03.120
can I book a meeting with you? I'm a can, yes, what time would you like? And then you say something,

30:03.120 --> 30:10.640
and then jump back to, is she free at 3 p.m. tomorrow? The she has to refer to me. Do you know what

30:10.640 --> 30:15.520
of me? We need to build that in, and that's the context, and then longer term is where I would like

30:15.520 --> 30:21.840
to get to, is that we can start using predictive analytics, you know, we understand your patterns,

30:21.840 --> 30:27.600
we understand that you ask for the coffee menu for Friday, um, why don't we send you that

30:27.600 --> 30:32.160
in advance? Why don't we talk to you? Um, so it's getting, that's why being sort of, it's an

30:32.160 --> 30:39.120
evolving path, and that's where, you know, we start looking at other areas of AI, you know,

30:39.120 --> 30:43.520
potentially machine learning, if we've got like a history of conversations, can you predict

30:43.520 --> 30:49.840
what the next conversation's going to be? Would that be useful even? What would that do? So I think

30:49.840 --> 30:55.440
the base of all this is getting, um, that's what putting place is the foundations of what I say,

30:55.440 --> 31:00.160
good quality analytics, and then we can evolve up, look for insights, and hopefully, you know,

31:00.160 --> 31:07.200
again, employees that better experience, as it learns, as it gets better. You mentioned also that

31:07.200 --> 31:14.960
one of the topics you covered was about the deployment, scale, CICD pipelines, all that kind of stuff.

31:15.520 --> 31:22.400
Can you give us an overview of the kind of things that you have done there to facilitate

31:22.960 --> 31:29.360
building out these kinds of applications on the engineering side? Yeah, um, so, um, like for any

31:29.360 --> 31:36.960
standard, um, application, you know, we have certain practices, um, we would run unit tests,

31:36.960 --> 31:43.200
integration tests, we would run those locally, you check your code in, the bell pipeline,

31:43.200 --> 31:49.600
picks those up, runs more tests, um, and then pushes through the environment. So that's the general,

31:49.600 --> 31:54.560
you know, process. Um, so what we had to do was come up with like a test framework essentially

31:54.560 --> 32:01.680
for less itself, um, you know, a unit testing conversation. So that's what we built into the

32:01.680 --> 32:09.520
pipeline was, um, the ability to, um, you know, we had scripted conversations that we would run

32:09.520 --> 32:14.720
on every single build to make sure that a change, you know, we may have added new utterances or new

32:14.720 --> 32:21.760
intents, hadn't impacted the model and the answers for all the other intents, and we did find that,

32:21.760 --> 32:28.400
you know, a real, um, a real benefit because, you know, we were making changes, we were,

32:28.960 --> 32:33.760
what made one thing work, made a different thing break. So we're finding it and constantly having

32:33.760 --> 32:39.920
that, um, backup of, we're not breaking it. And that's a standard process, but it was in a new

32:39.920 --> 32:45.600
world and a new, sorry, technology. So we had to think about how to apply those, but I would say

32:45.600 --> 32:52.960
good practices to this new, new way of creating software. Um, so we did that. The other thing that

32:52.960 --> 32:58.640
was very important was the building of the bought itself, um, you know, for anybody who has worked

32:58.640 --> 33:05.440
in a large enterprise company, um, there is certain rules and standards and things have to be

33:05.440 --> 33:10.800
put in place. And one of them is very specific, a runner usage of the public load in that we have

33:10.800 --> 33:19.680
a sandbox environment for people to prototype POC and, um, learn about how to use new services,

33:19.680 --> 33:27.120
but beyond that, everything has to be pushed through those accounts, um, through code. So we had

33:27.120 --> 33:33.760
to come up with a whole build pipeline for Amazon Lacks and the bought itself, um, which we created,

33:33.760 --> 33:40.320
um, when we were waiting on, literally, um, 19th of April, because I was waiting on the date,

33:40.320 --> 33:46.560
when it went GA and the build SDKs were released. Um, I think that's, I think it surprised

33:46.560 --> 33:51.360
Amazon because we've heard from them, um, after fact, that, you know, they just thought people

33:51.360 --> 33:56.960
would do it in the console. It's like, well, that's great for POC. It's not going to get us into

33:56.960 --> 34:03.040
production. So that's where we worked, um, on those aspects of it, which in the scheme of things

34:03.040 --> 34:07.280
when you hear people talk about chat box, it's not the things we talk about, but those are the

34:07.280 --> 34:12.800
practices that we'll get to into, you know, a, a chat box environment that will, you know,

34:12.800 --> 34:17.680
scale the thousands of employees and then with work rates off, where obviously thousands of

34:17.680 --> 34:22.640
employees across multiple countries, some companies, so you're in their multi-tenant chat box

34:22.640 --> 34:29.040
environment. So it's really taken, you know, best practices, I think is what I would say,

34:29.040 --> 34:33.600
and bring it into a chat box world. Um, and when they were experimenting, I said,

34:33.600 --> 34:39.600
voice, um, how do you test the speech recognition, how do you do those things. So it's all very

34:39.600 --> 34:45.360
interesting, very exciting, um, to be honest. Um, and I think it's probably clear, like the,

34:45.360 --> 34:50.880
the driver or the, not the driver, the enabler for a list, to me, it's, it's public cloud.

34:50.880 --> 34:56.240
Whichever one that you're working in is, you know, they're all comparative and competitive services.

34:57.040 --> 35:03.360
But really, to me, it's the, the place that enablers developers just even get started,

35:03.360 --> 35:10.400
with aspects of AI. Um, you know, if you do have an interest, it definitely is a place to experiment

35:10.400 --> 35:17.280
with. Have you run into any downsides or limitations associated with running in the

35:17.280 --> 35:24.000
public cloud or depending on the public cloud services? Um, I think the, I don't know if it's

35:24.000 --> 35:30.640
done, there's no real dying science because, um, you know, as I talked about, I like to,

35:30.640 --> 35:38.160
I, I personally feel that from an AI perspective, um, that there's few companies that would be able

35:38.160 --> 35:44.560
to compete with some of the capabilities that are being made available in public cloud. Um,

35:44.560 --> 35:49.360
just from the ease of use, um, the, the rollout, like the new service of the release,

35:49.360 --> 35:54.960
the re-infair for example, just so many new stuff. Um, you know, but I think the,

35:54.960 --> 36:00.880
the, the guy inside, it's not dying science, it's just an awareness of where your data is, you know,

36:00.880 --> 36:06.960
um, make sure that you thoroughly think through what data you're trying to store. Um, you know,

36:06.960 --> 36:12.560
it doesn't need to be anonymized. So it's just, you know, I think a general understanding of how

36:12.560 --> 36:18.640
the cloud works needs to be there before you just start turning things on, um, sending data everywhere.

36:18.640 --> 36:26.480
Um, buzzer say, like, I have that. So, you know, every service we use, um, and it is assessed

36:26.480 --> 36:33.120
through a security process that we will have. Um, I don't think not a dying site, but just have

36:33.120 --> 36:39.840
an awareness, um, of all the different services that you potentially use in your, um, product.

36:40.560 --> 36:46.640
Well, Jillian, thanks so much for taking the time to chat with us. So there are any final thoughts

36:46.640 --> 36:52.560
or things that you'd like to add? Um, I think as far as I have said it several times, I just see,

36:52.560 --> 36:58.960
you know, the voice, um, as the future interface, um, for people who are interested, you know,

36:58.960 --> 37:05.360
in the ability, not the, you know, it lacks, um, the developer skills SDK and the Google Assistant,

37:05.360 --> 37:11.200
you know, if anybody's any interest, they literally can start tomorrow and create simple skills

37:11.200 --> 37:18.720
and have a go because it really opens your eyes to the potential, um, of high, you know,

37:18.720 --> 37:24.160
certain aspects of AI I want to change your lives. Awesome. Well, Jillian, thank you. Thank you so

37:24.160 --> 37:33.680
much. It was great chatting with you. Thank you. All right, everyone. That's our show for today.
