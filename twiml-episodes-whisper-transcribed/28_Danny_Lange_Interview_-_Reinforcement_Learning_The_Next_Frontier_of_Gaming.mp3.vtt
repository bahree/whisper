00:00.000 --> 00:16.760
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

00:16.760 --> 00:21.760
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.200
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:25.200 --> 00:30.080
My guest on the show this week is Danny Lang, Vice President for Machine Learning and AI

00:30.080 --> 00:34.200
at Video Game Technology Developer Unity Technologies.

00:34.200 --> 00:39.160
Danny is well-traveled in the world of ML and AI and has had a hand in developing machine

00:39.160 --> 00:43.840
learning platforms at companies like Uber, Amazon and Microsoft.

00:43.840 --> 00:48.600
In this conversation, we cover a bunch of topics including how ML and AI are being used

00:48.600 --> 00:53.800
in gaming, the importance of reinforcement learning in the future of game development,

00:53.800 --> 00:59.440
the intersection between AI and augmented and virtual reality and the next steps in natural

00:59.440 --> 01:01.760
character interaction.

01:01.760 --> 01:06.040
But before we get to Danny, does anyone want to guess what today is?

01:06.040 --> 01:08.800
Well, not really today but tomorrow.

01:08.800 --> 01:13.560
And well, unless you hear this on Friday May 19th, not even really tomorrow for you.

01:13.560 --> 01:18.440
In any case, what I'm trying to get at is that tomorrow is a very special day for the

01:18.440 --> 01:19.440
Twimble family.

01:19.440 --> 01:26.880
Yep, you guessed it, tomorrow May 20th is the one year anniversary of this week in Machine

01:26.880 --> 01:29.280
Learning and AI.

01:29.280 --> 01:33.480
I started this podcast last year as a way to share what I was learning about the field

01:33.480 --> 01:38.800
and to be quite honest, I really had no idea what I was getting into.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.280
But what an amazing ride it's been.

01:41.280 --> 01:46.360
The amount of interest in the podcast has been incredible and I could not be more appreciative

01:46.360 --> 01:50.400
of and impressed with the Twimble listener community.

01:50.400 --> 01:52.560
Thank you so much.

01:52.560 --> 01:56.440
We've been working really hard to be worthy of your attention by continuing to bring you

01:56.440 --> 02:01.400
amazing content that you can't find anyplace else.

02:01.400 --> 02:05.920
While we'd usually mention our quote contest now, which was inspired by the way by Twimble

02:05.920 --> 02:10.720
listener Beth Ann Noble, I'd like to do something special this time around to celebrate our

02:10.720 --> 02:12.400
birthday.

02:12.400 --> 02:17.760
This week we'd like to announce a very special listener appreciation contest to honor the

02:17.760 --> 02:19.600
occasion.

02:19.600 --> 02:24.640
First prize in this contest will be a bronze pass to the upcoming O'Reilly AI conference

02:24.640 --> 02:28.480
in New York City valued at $1,800.

02:28.480 --> 02:33.160
I'll be there and I'd love to have you there as my guest.

02:33.160 --> 02:38.480
Second prize is a brand new Google home powered by AI.

02:38.480 --> 02:42.200
You know you can listen to the podcast on these, right?

02:42.200 --> 02:46.840
And of course every entrant will win a couple of stickers, one for you and one for a friend

02:46.840 --> 02:50.960
and of course our everlasting love and appreciation.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.040
So how do you enter?

02:52.040 --> 02:53.560
Well it's easy.

02:53.560 --> 02:58.720
Leave us a review on iTunes or comment on this week's show notes page that'll be at twimble

03:08.160 --> 03:09.640
It's that easy.

03:09.640 --> 03:14.200
We'll select the winners on June 1st and announce the winners on the next show.

03:14.200 --> 03:18.000
We'll have an alternate prize available for first place winners who know they can attend

03:18.000 --> 03:22.560
the O'Reilly event, which would be of similar value as the second place prize.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.920
But the details here are TBD.

03:24.920 --> 03:27.680
All the contest details will be available on the show notes page.

03:27.680 --> 03:32.280
So click right over or better yet, jump into your podcast app right now and leave us

03:32.280 --> 03:36.560
a review and wish us happy birthday.

03:36.560 --> 03:39.000
One more quick note before we get to Danny.

03:39.000 --> 03:44.400
The future of data summit was earlier this week and wow, it was really an amazing event.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.880
The speakers were just outstanding.

03:46.880 --> 03:50.240
Obviously, most of you couldn't make it to the event.

03:50.240 --> 03:53.960
So I'm working with the interop conference to see if I can publish the session recording

03:53.960 --> 03:56.640
someplace and I'll let you know if I can.

03:56.640 --> 03:57.640
Okay.

03:57.640 --> 04:08.120
And now on to our show.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.120
Hello, everyone.

04:09.120 --> 04:11.800
I am on the line with Danny Lang.

04:11.800 --> 04:17.720
Danny is vice president for AI and machine learning at Unity Technologies.

04:17.720 --> 04:21.000
And I'm super excited to have him on as a guest.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.560
Danny, why don't you say hi to the audience?

04:23.560 --> 04:26.160
Hey there and thanks for having me.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.160
Absolutely.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.160
Absolutely.

04:28.160 --> 04:33.680
So why don't we start by having you tell us a little bit about your background.

04:33.680 --> 04:40.040
You have quite an impressive background in this field having built platforms that pretty

04:40.040 --> 04:44.080
much all of the places that are, or many of the places that are doing very cool things

04:44.080 --> 04:45.080
with ML and AI.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.400
Why don't you tell us a little bit about that?

04:47.400 --> 04:48.400
Sure.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.400
Yeah.

04:49.400 --> 04:54.360
I joined Unity Technologies about three months ago.

04:54.360 --> 05:05.880
I saw gaming and VR and AR as a huge opportunity to go in and change it through AI and machine

05:05.880 --> 05:07.880
learning.

05:07.880 --> 05:11.080
But I think we'll talk more about that in a moment.

05:11.080 --> 05:16.880
But before joining Unity Technologies, I was head of machine learning at Uber, which

05:16.880 --> 05:20.320
is a complete different business.

05:20.320 --> 05:27.200
At Uber, we used machine learning basically all over the company.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.000
There were three really big areas.

05:30.000 --> 05:36.600
One was drivers, riders and trips, where we used machine learning to give you a better

05:36.600 --> 05:40.040
experience, both as a driver and a rider.

05:40.040 --> 05:48.040
And then there's the whole map business of building maps for the Uber drivers, a lot

05:48.040 --> 05:55.600
of machine learning there to basically convert street side imagery and other data into maps

05:55.600 --> 05:57.080
automatically.

05:57.080 --> 06:02.320
And then the last area is, of course, the famous self-driving course was involved in that

06:02.320 --> 06:06.560
effort as well, a lot of machine learning there.

06:06.560 --> 06:07.880
Of course.

06:07.880 --> 06:12.840
And before Uber, I was general manager for machine learning at Amazon.

06:12.840 --> 06:22.560
And it's also very, very interesting to see how Amazon really understood to use machine

06:22.560 --> 06:24.760
learning all corners of the company.

06:24.760 --> 06:33.280
I ran the elastic machine learning team, which was essentially a platform that other teams

06:33.280 --> 06:38.680
could use to enable machine learning in their specific business areas.

06:38.680 --> 06:43.320
So we had lots of teams using machine learning that way.

06:43.320 --> 06:48.880
And before that, I was at Microsoft, I was also working on machine learning there.

06:48.880 --> 06:51.880
So it goes on and on.

06:51.880 --> 06:56.480
Many years ago, I spent eight years in two different startups where we were trying to

06:56.480 --> 07:01.680
build virtual assistants, the ones that we know today as Alexa and Siri.

07:01.680 --> 07:09.080
We tried to build them at that time for the earlier mobile phones.

07:09.080 --> 07:13.680
That was pretty tough because the speech recognition at that time maybe had an accuracy

07:13.680 --> 07:16.680
of 80 percent today.

07:16.680 --> 07:17.680
What is it?

07:17.680 --> 07:18.680
95.

07:18.680 --> 07:26.000
So those were hard, hard times to do, to do AI because it didn't seem very smart.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.480
We've made a lot of progress.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.480
Oh, yeah.

07:28.480 --> 07:33.040
And so how did you get into machine learning in the first place?

07:33.040 --> 07:35.800
Did you study it in school?

07:35.800 --> 07:36.960
Not early on.

07:36.960 --> 07:37.960
This is very long.

07:37.960 --> 07:44.840
So long time ago, I don't want to talk about it, but I got in when I was at IBM Research,

07:44.840 --> 07:48.040
my key area was autonomous agents.

07:48.040 --> 07:55.760
So it was a lot of the vision of having software that would make decisions on its own.

07:55.760 --> 08:00.260
You would let it lose, I developed what we call mobile agents and it would basically

08:00.260 --> 08:05.520
suffer objects that could move over the internet and adapt to local environments and things

08:05.520 --> 08:06.680
like that.

08:06.680 --> 08:13.160
But it was all sort of fairly engineering heavy, engineering heavy development, we designed

08:13.160 --> 08:17.560
these, we implemented them and if you had a bug in there, it would get stuck on another

08:17.560 --> 08:20.880
computer and not move on and things like that.

08:20.880 --> 08:29.360
So I got really interested in how you could make these agents more resilient.

08:29.360 --> 08:36.840
And that's sort of where we headed today with machine learning, with concepts like reinforcement

08:36.840 --> 08:45.400
learning and other technologies that allow these objects to learn and adapt to the environment

08:45.400 --> 08:46.400
then.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.400
Okay.

08:47.400 --> 08:55.680
Well, that is a really interesting topic, one that we want to dive into right now, where

08:55.680 --> 09:00.440
I really wanted to go with this is, you know, we've talked about a lot of different applications

09:00.440 --> 09:04.360
of machine learning on this podcast, but we've never talked about gaming.

09:04.360 --> 09:10.360
And so I'm super excited to have you on to really dive into how ML and AI are being

09:10.360 --> 09:12.920
used in gaming environments right now.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.920
What's the best way to start that discussion?

09:14.920 --> 09:22.960
Yeah, let's start out by just acknowledging that, whether it's at Microsoft or Amazon

09:22.960 --> 09:28.360
or Uber, it's the same kind of technologies that we're using, it's the same algorithms,

09:28.360 --> 09:30.440
the same concepts, yeah.

09:30.440 --> 09:36.520
And you would be surprised that when you move into gaming, we again are going to use the

09:36.520 --> 09:45.760
same technologies to bring more automation in, so to have the games optimized, have the

09:45.760 --> 09:52.960
games being interacting more closely with you, it's in many ways the same approach, the

09:52.960 --> 09:58.680
same technique as when we at Amazon try to basically sell you more books.

09:58.680 --> 09:59.680
Right.

09:59.680 --> 10:04.920
It's this idea that the systems will learn from you and they will adapt is this idea that

10:04.920 --> 10:10.960
no developer can sit down and code, a hundred lines of code, and then it knows exactly

10:10.960 --> 10:13.000
how to get you to buy a book.

10:13.000 --> 10:18.640
It's sort of the same concept that we want to bring to the game world.

10:18.640 --> 10:26.880
So there are, I guess I would describe that world in two broad categories, there's machine

10:26.880 --> 10:32.360
learning and AI that happens in-game, and then there's all the stuff that many other companies

10:32.360 --> 10:39.920
have to deal with in terms of making people more likely to play the game and optimizing

10:39.920 --> 10:42.440
selling the game and things like that.

10:42.440 --> 10:48.440
Are you involved in both sides of both of those categories at Unity?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.240
Exactly.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.440
My job is really two jobs.

10:52.440 --> 11:01.320
So one part of my job is to make sure that many, many thousands of game developers can

11:01.320 --> 11:06.120
monetize their games, that they can make money on their games, so that they can develop

11:06.120 --> 11:07.800
more games.

11:07.800 --> 11:13.080
So we support and advertisement infrastructure.

11:13.080 --> 11:20.400
We use machine learning to optimize the ads, which is essentially bringing a game or

11:20.400 --> 11:26.240
from one game to another game and the creator of that game then will make some money from

11:26.240 --> 11:27.840
that.

11:27.840 --> 11:32.680
And that's a classic called monetization through ads structure.

11:32.680 --> 11:39.240
There's also in app purchases where you will spend money within the game, running campaigns

11:39.240 --> 11:45.720
and promotions, all that is what I would call sort of very classical machine learning.

11:45.720 --> 11:53.080
And it's super important for the ecosystem to be able to make a living from making games.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.120
It's very important for our developers.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.280
That's only half of the story.

11:57.280 --> 12:05.320
The other half of the story is really when it comes to the creation of games.

12:05.320 --> 12:14.160
And that's where AI in the gaming world means something slightly different from when I'm

12:14.160 --> 12:15.640
using the word AI.

12:15.640 --> 12:16.640
Okay.

12:16.640 --> 12:24.320
So a lot of concepts in the gaming world is AI means having systems that look and behave

12:24.320 --> 12:25.720
in a natural way.

12:25.720 --> 12:26.720
Right.

12:26.720 --> 12:34.160
There's a rule based systems that allow an NPC and a non-player character or a computer

12:34.160 --> 12:36.280
agent to move around in a game.

12:36.280 --> 12:41.680
And it looks a lot of reasonable, you know, sensible what it's doing.

12:41.680 --> 12:48.440
But a lot of that is either hot wired or coded through a set of rules.

12:48.440 --> 12:49.440
Yeah.

12:49.440 --> 12:53.640
Let's actually, if I can press the pause button there, this is a question that I've

12:53.640 --> 13:02.000
had asked before we've had, you know, in games going back to, you know, my Atari 2600,

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
right?

13:03.000 --> 13:06.480
You have the ability to play against the computer.

13:06.480 --> 13:07.960
Is that AI?

13:07.960 --> 13:12.440
And you were just kind of getting at this with the rule based and others.

13:12.440 --> 13:16.200
What's the difference between that and, you know, where we're trying to get to today?

13:16.200 --> 13:17.200
Yeah.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.800
That's actually a good question.

13:18.800 --> 13:24.880
It is, it is not what I understand by AI, but it has elements on it, yeah.

13:24.880 --> 13:30.960
It implements behavior through rules or really, you know, deterministic, hot wired code.

13:30.960 --> 13:36.680
It implements behavior that may emulate a human player, you know.

13:36.680 --> 13:42.000
But I want to take that a step further, you know, that's not the way that companies

13:42.000 --> 13:49.960
like Amazon or Uber works, yeah, when they try to sell you more products that they try

13:49.960 --> 13:56.160
to get a car faster to you, that is basically done through the use of data.

13:56.160 --> 13:57.160
Right.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.360
That's where we want to move the game world.

13:59.360 --> 14:07.880
We want to make sure that games learn from previous place and become more and more natural

14:07.880 --> 14:11.040
in the interaction with the player, yeah.

14:11.040 --> 14:16.600
And that's where concepts like machine learning come in, yeah.

14:16.600 --> 14:22.360
I can give some examples of a particularly branch of machine learning, which is called

14:22.360 --> 14:23.760
reinforcement learning.

14:23.760 --> 14:24.760
Okay.

14:24.760 --> 14:36.000
And that's essentially where the computer has this ability to randomly move a character

14:36.000 --> 14:41.560
around and learn from that, what happens to that character, yeah.

14:41.560 --> 14:49.600
So if you tell the computer that character should not get killed, it should be avoid getting

14:49.600 --> 14:56.360
shot by the human player, then the character will over time, you know, basically learn

14:56.360 --> 15:00.560
behavior and strategies to avoid getting shot, yeah.

15:00.560 --> 15:05.400
So we basically say the character has a rewards function, which is you get punished if you

15:05.400 --> 15:11.720
get shot or hit, and you get a plus point, you know, for every minute you survive, yeah.

15:11.720 --> 15:19.800
So with the reason developments in deep learning, these agents are able to learn some really

15:19.800 --> 15:29.200
complex strategies on their own that make them very, very appealing to play against, yeah.

15:29.200 --> 15:38.720
And so if I'm a player of a game that's, you know, using an AI-based agent that I'm playing

15:38.720 --> 15:44.200
either with or against, how will that feel different to me than, you know, what I've

15:44.200 --> 15:52.000
seen with traditional, you know, automated opponents or our players?

15:52.000 --> 16:00.280
Yeah, the traditional systems are what we could sort of call they shallow, they implement

16:00.280 --> 16:09.120
very simple functions, whereas with this concept of deep learning, we're able to implement

16:09.120 --> 16:15.520
or the system is able to represent very, very complex non-linear functions.

16:15.520 --> 16:27.400
So let me give some examples, when deep mind introduced AlphaGo, it, you know, it did beat

16:27.400 --> 16:33.480
the World Champion and go, and the way it did that was basically by, you know, playing

16:33.480 --> 16:40.360
some moves that initially looked really harmless, that did not get the opponents, the human

16:40.360 --> 16:47.680
opponents attention, but certainly in very few moves, set the human opponent up failure,

16:47.680 --> 16:48.680
yeah.

16:48.680 --> 16:57.280
So we have seen another example of poker playing using deep reinforcement nets for,

16:57.280 --> 17:00.880
for poker playing, where the system will learn to bluff.

17:00.880 --> 17:06.480
So the big, big difference is that these systems, and I use the term deep here, they're

17:06.480 --> 17:17.480
deep in the sense that they have a very good memory of events way back that leads, eventually

17:17.480 --> 17:20.680
leads to great success.

17:20.680 --> 17:26.240
So they become more strategic than we're used to, in some cases they become more strategic

17:26.240 --> 17:28.920
that any human player would be, yeah.

17:28.920 --> 17:34.800
So they're ready to run the risk like in poker, they actually run the risk of losing by

17:34.800 --> 17:40.720
bluffing because they know that there is a bigger benefit out there.

17:40.720 --> 17:47.000
And it's, and not because they were programmed to bluff every so often, but rather because

17:47.000 --> 17:51.760
they've discovered the strategy through the training process.

17:51.760 --> 17:57.000
That's accurate, spot on, and that's the, that's the new thing.

17:57.000 --> 18:04.080
That's what we're able to do today, and that really changes the, a part of game development

18:04.080 --> 18:14.000
to become more about defining the objective or the success criteria for that in PC.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.760
Because let's just say that we define it as those shall not get shot, yeah.

18:18.760 --> 18:24.400
Then the agent will really, you know, be really good at hiding, yeah, and you will get

18:24.400 --> 18:27.320
really good at it, yeah.

18:27.320 --> 18:32.200
Just getting away in time, every time you try to find it, yeah, that's not fun, yeah.

18:32.200 --> 18:39.040
So what you have to do is you have to set up some, some criteria for that in PC to that

18:39.040 --> 18:47.960
eventually will allow it to develop some subtle and complex strategies that you cannot predict

18:47.960 --> 18:56.240
by say, but we know will lead to some very, very appealing behavior that will give, you

18:56.240 --> 19:01.280
know, great enjoyment to play against because they are maybe hard to predict.

19:01.280 --> 19:06.080
You constantly think you're about to have this agent and then they fool you, and then

19:06.080 --> 19:08.120
it becomes very entertaining, yeah.

19:08.120 --> 19:15.640
And that's what we have seen that these very deep, these deep nets, full reinforcement

19:15.640 --> 19:21.480
learning can really build up these very complex strategies that, that, that, that sometimes

19:21.480 --> 19:27.520
I saw quote from one poker player who basically stated that if he didn't know better, he

19:27.520 --> 19:34.760
will, he would characterize that as a really like human spirit in that game play, yeah.

19:34.760 --> 19:35.760
Yeah.

19:35.760 --> 19:42.840
So the, I think the popular examples of, or at least the, you know, the celebrated

19:42.840 --> 19:49.440
AI successes have been around these strategy board games like Go and Chess, to what extent

19:49.440 --> 19:56.080
are games like, you know, your Xbox games like Halo or Call of Duty, to what extent are

19:56.080 --> 20:00.880
the various agents in those games powered by something that you would think of as AI

20:00.880 --> 20:01.880
today?

20:01.880 --> 20:06.480
Uh, today they are powered by what we would call classic game AI.

20:06.480 --> 20:13.720
So it's, it's in, uh, in, uh, in most, most of the cases that I'm aware of, it's, it's

20:13.720 --> 20:16.200
very complex rule based systems.

20:16.200 --> 20:25.360
In some cases, way, way over a thousand independent rules that have been created by the developers

20:25.360 --> 20:33.680
who basically cover a lot of different situations, uh, very complex systems, uh, but we, we saw

20:33.680 --> 20:41.680
a similar approach in, in anti virus, uh, programs for a long time, they developed basically

20:41.680 --> 20:50.680
databases of rules that would identify, you know, components or elements of virus software.

20:50.680 --> 20:55.680
And today all these systems have moved on, and I actually using a lot of them are using,

20:55.680 --> 21:02.720
uh, deep learning, uh, uh, for, for training on, on, on, uh, known viruses to detect, you

21:02.720 --> 21:04.080
know, new viruses.

21:04.080 --> 21:10.800
And, are you aware of any particular, uh, efforts or results that have been maybe published

21:10.800 --> 21:17.160
somewhere, uh, on, in terms of introducing AI into these types of games?

21:17.160 --> 21:20.960
No, not, not in any commercial games.

21:20.960 --> 21:25.880
Uh, we would, of course, you know, from unit to technology side, we would, uh, that's

21:25.880 --> 21:32.120
one of our objectives is to, to, to offer that, uh, sometime in the future.

21:32.120 --> 21:37.840
Uh, there's a lot of research going on, uh, so if we go to academia, go to the research

21:37.840 --> 21:43.920
community, there's a great interest in, uh, in, uh, in, uh, in start working on this.

21:43.920 --> 21:50.440
Uh, the, the peel is, of course, that if I can do this, if I can get an NPC in a game

21:50.440 --> 21:57.880
to, to act in a very reasonable and intelligent, uh, and constructive way, uh, then, you

21:57.880 --> 22:02.440
know, eventually, you know, maybe real robots could behave that way too.

22:02.440 --> 22:03.440
Right.

22:03.440 --> 22:04.440
Right.

22:04.440 --> 22:05.440
Right.

22:05.440 --> 22:12.880
So how do you, uh, as unity, how do you, uh, expect this to evolve and, uh, are there

22:12.880 --> 22:18.760
a set of services that you, uh, are hoping to deliver to game developers?

22:18.760 --> 22:24.400
Um, how do you think this evolves over time, uh, to, so that we'll see it more in games?

22:24.400 --> 22:25.400
Yeah.

22:25.400 --> 22:36.200
It's, it's my, my hope that we can make some of these, uh, uh, algorithms available

22:36.200 --> 22:43.360
and services, uh, essentially to enable a game developer, who is not an AI or neural

22:43.360 --> 22:50.840
network or ML guy, you know, some DBI specialist, but basically a game developer, make a game

22:50.840 --> 23:00.200
developer, having a toolbox of, of, of, of AI, uh, services that they can use to train

23:00.200 --> 23:08.760
a character, uh, and in that sense, sort of gradually enable AI in game development.

23:08.760 --> 23:12.800
We have to understand that this is, this is the livelihood of, of, of, you know, our

23:12.800 --> 23:13.800
developers.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.520
This is how, how they, they make money and that's how they live.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.520
Yeah.

23:17.520 --> 23:18.520
They develop games.

23:18.520 --> 23:23.400
So what we want to do is we want to give them these tools that allow them to create

23:23.400 --> 23:26.960
maybe, uh, you know, maybe make it more efficient.

23:26.960 --> 23:31.280
They can create some games faster, they can create games that are more entertaining,

23:31.280 --> 23:33.040
uh, et cetera, yeah.

23:33.040 --> 23:38.480
Uh, so we want to make that available so that it can sort of gradually be, be, be, be

23:38.480 --> 23:44.800
adopted and we can also learn from the use, nobody has really done this very much yet.

23:44.800 --> 23:45.800
Yeah.

23:45.800 --> 23:48.440
So we don't know yet how, how it's going to work in practice.

23:48.440 --> 23:53.400
In some ways, there's, uh, it strikes me that there's a precedent for this and that game

23:53.400 --> 23:57.480
developers aren't typically physicists either, but it's very common for them to work with

23:57.480 --> 24:01.760
these physics engines nowadays to develop their games, no?

24:01.760 --> 24:02.760
That's correct.

24:02.760 --> 24:08.560
Uh, we, we have, um, we have actually done some, uh, studies where we are using reinforcement

24:08.560 --> 24:16.560
learning to have characters learn how to move in a world where there's gravity and friction,

24:16.560 --> 24:17.560
yeah.

24:17.560 --> 24:23.760
Uh, and, uh, and inertia and it, it's kind of interesting to see how, how a character

24:23.760 --> 24:31.120
can learn, uh, you know, to, to walk or run or jump, uh, without, uh, knowing it from

24:31.120 --> 24:32.120
the outset.

24:32.120 --> 24:38.640
But by basically attempting, you know, tens of thousands of times, you know, and over

24:38.640 --> 24:45.240
time, you will figure out the pattern of movements, uh, to jump, for instance, yeah.

24:45.240 --> 24:50.400
And in that sense, you know, we, uh, we act to using the fact that we can, we can simulate

24:50.400 --> 24:54.760
gravity, simulate friction and inertia in the physics engine.

24:54.760 --> 24:55.760
Okay.

24:55.760 --> 25:02.280
Um, you know, one question that I've had about the application of reinforcement learning

25:02.280 --> 25:07.680
to games is, I guess when, when we think about machine learning in general, and I don't

25:07.680 --> 25:13.240
believe that reinforcement learning, uh, is a common exception to this, you've got kind

25:13.240 --> 25:18.560
of your two separate stages, you've got your training stage and your inference stage.

25:18.560 --> 25:26.840
Um, but in a game environment, I imagine part of the appeal of AI is so that the, the

25:26.840 --> 25:30.960
agents in the game can learn from the game as it's happening, right?

25:30.960 --> 25:35.840
So not during a training phase, but during the, the actual playing phase.

25:35.840 --> 25:41.720
Uh, how is, how does that, um, you know, is that, uh, we've talked about on the show

25:41.720 --> 25:47.120
active learning, which may be a part of this, but is there a specific name for that?

25:47.120 --> 25:49.880
And, uh, how is it commonly done today?

25:49.880 --> 25:50.880
Yeah.

25:50.880 --> 25:53.200
Um, you're absolutely right.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.200
Yeah.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.200
That's where I would love to go.

25:56.200 --> 26:02.800
I would love to go, let me, let me give some crazy, crazy examples yet.

26:02.800 --> 26:07.800
But imagine that, uh, say that you are playing your Pokemon, Pokemon go, yeah.

26:07.800 --> 26:08.800
Right.

26:08.800 --> 26:12.920
I have to train your character, yeah, today the training of that character is just, it's

26:12.920 --> 26:17.440
not really anything, yeah, you just click a few times and, and that's how you train

26:17.440 --> 26:18.440
it.

26:18.440 --> 26:19.440
Yeah.

26:19.440 --> 26:23.800
But imagine that you are actually training that character to battle and you could train

26:23.800 --> 26:29.600
it for half an hour or one hour and that you are actually teaching and reinforcement

26:29.600 --> 26:33.480
algorithm behind the character, yeah, in real time.

26:33.480 --> 26:39.280
And if you're really good at training it, it may beat the, some other, uh, person's character,

26:39.280 --> 26:43.320
yeah, who is not that good at training it.

26:43.320 --> 26:44.320
That's one thing.

26:44.320 --> 26:50.160
The other thing is that if the game can learn through gameplay, then it can learn, uh,

26:50.160 --> 26:56.640
about you and just like Amazon and Netflix, uh, they basically tailor everything you

26:56.640 --> 27:02.240
see to, to you, I mean, if you go to Netflix, what you see is different from what I see,

27:02.240 --> 27:04.120
yeah, it's tailored to you.

27:04.120 --> 27:09.760
What if every game in that sense was tailored to you, yeah, if, if the game knows that you're

27:09.760 --> 27:16.000
only happy if you progress fast through the levels, then let's make it easy to progress,

27:16.000 --> 27:17.000
yeah.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.840
But if the game knows that I'm sort of more rigorous and I want, you know, to fight hard

27:21.840 --> 27:28.440
from get to level to level, then, um, then that's a different, different approach, yeah.

27:28.440 --> 27:29.760
What if games could adapt?

27:29.760 --> 27:32.840
Oh, that's really interesting.

27:32.840 --> 27:38.360
I'd be happy if the games could know that, uh, you know, whenever I'm playing Call of Duty,

27:38.360 --> 27:42.120
I'm hiding in this particular corner and make it a little bit less easy for me to just

27:42.120 --> 27:44.320
camp out there and snipe on people.

27:44.320 --> 27:45.800
Exactly.

27:45.800 --> 27:46.800
Yes.

27:46.800 --> 27:54.880
You mentioned that one of the, one of the motivations for you joining Unity was, uh, what

27:54.880 --> 27:58.400
was going on in terms of augmented and virtual reality.

27:58.400 --> 28:02.160
Can you talk a little bit about that and how, where you see the intersections between

28:02.160 --> 28:04.360
AR VR and AI being?

28:04.360 --> 28:05.360
Yeah.

28:05.360 --> 28:12.360
Now, if you think about a game, as you know, today being, it's very controlled environment,

28:12.360 --> 28:13.360
yeah.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.400
I can, I can hard code the game.

28:15.400 --> 28:19.200
I can add AI to the game, but it's a very controlled environment, yeah.

28:19.200 --> 28:20.200
Right.

28:20.200 --> 28:27.400
We start moving into VR and AR, we start having, you know, a lot more flexibility.

28:27.400 --> 28:29.480
So let's take, take VR a bit.

28:29.480 --> 28:30.480
Yeah.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.400
Now I, I, I emerge into a game.

28:32.400 --> 28:37.960
I can now, you know, move around in the game and I can, you know, I can pet the characters

28:37.960 --> 28:38.960
in the game.

28:38.960 --> 28:39.960
I can touch them.

28:39.960 --> 28:40.960
Right.

28:40.960 --> 28:48.720
And when I do that, the bar moves up for what I consider naturalness.

28:48.720 --> 28:49.720
Yeah.

28:49.720 --> 28:53.400
I may play a game on a phone and I can see the characters are not, you know, they are

28:53.400 --> 28:57.000
characters and they are a bit artificial in their movements, yeah.

28:57.000 --> 29:04.480
When I put on my goggles, I, I want to get immersed into this, this new world, yeah.

29:04.480 --> 29:08.520
And things have to act in a very natural way with me.

29:08.520 --> 29:12.000
Otherwise, the illusion breaks and it's not really fun.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.000
Right.

29:13.000 --> 29:18.840
Take that a step further in augmented reality, the, the game, or should we call it the

29:18.840 --> 29:23.760
app, because you can be way more than games, yeah, let's write the app, yeah, needs to

29:23.760 --> 29:30.880
sort of connect between myself and the surroundings, yeah.

29:30.880 --> 29:36.360
And those surroundings can now be anything, yeah, I, I don't know, you use this app.

29:36.360 --> 29:37.600
I don't know where you're going to use it.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.520
I don't know what's going to be there.

29:39.520 --> 29:46.360
So you see the bar goes up constantly up where you can no longer imagine, you know, a thousand

29:46.360 --> 29:50.520
lines of, of code being the answer to everything.

29:50.520 --> 29:51.520
Right.

29:51.520 --> 29:55.720
And that's where you need to have AI really come in, yeah.

29:55.720 --> 30:02.240
And that, that is, is, is, of course, an area where we can, we can make a big change

30:02.240 --> 30:04.240
through AI.

30:04.240 --> 30:06.600
Clearly, I think that makes a lot of sense.

30:06.600 --> 30:12.880
The user expectation is dramatically increased because you want this environment to be immersive

30:12.880 --> 30:15.920
and engaging and feel lifelike.

30:15.920 --> 30:21.400
And so it only makes sense that you'd have, you're interacting with Intelligent Things

30:21.400 --> 30:23.400
if they're, you know, beings.

30:23.400 --> 30:30.760
Do you expect the, the AI techniques that we use to do this to, you know, be the same

30:30.760 --> 30:34.960
kind of things that we're applying every place else, or these, they're going to be a new

30:34.960 --> 30:39.640
set of techniques that come into play when we start talking AR VR.

30:39.640 --> 30:46.160
I think it's going to, initially, is going to be sort of the same technologies, but I want

30:46.160 --> 30:52.320
to say one thing here, which is when we do talk about this of VR and AR, that we're able

30:52.320 --> 30:58.480
to push the boundary of AI much, much further here and much faster.

30:58.480 --> 31:06.960
Now, if I'm building a self-driving car, I, I have to be very careful how far I push

31:06.960 --> 31:16.600
the boundaries of AI, AI, because it's, it's a 2,000 pound or more object that may actually

31:16.600 --> 31:23.960
kill people if I'm not, you know, understanding what I'm doing as a machine learning on AI

31:23.960 --> 31:26.080
expert, yeah.

31:26.080 --> 31:30.200
So you need to really put a lot of boundaries in.

31:30.200 --> 31:35.160
When you build an industrial robot, it's the same, yeah, it needs to build a car, but

31:35.160 --> 31:42.760
it should not hit the operator around it, so it has a lot of hardwiring taking place.

31:42.760 --> 31:52.600
When you move to VR and AR, I'm like, how, you know, how bad can it be, how can you make?

31:52.600 --> 31:59.800
So you can really push the boundary there, yet you create a complete, you know, believable

31:59.800 --> 32:03.400
world, yeah, at the same time, yeah.

32:03.400 --> 32:09.120
So, so you give people this experience and you can push the boundaries of AI to its

32:09.120 --> 32:10.120
very limits.

32:10.120 --> 32:14.000
And if you go over, people take the goggles off and say, no, that was really bad, you

32:14.000 --> 32:19.240
know, that was not believable, yeah, right, yeah.

32:19.240 --> 32:24.240
And that attracts me a lot to this space here, because when you sell books or you get

32:24.240 --> 32:32.040
taxes around, you are to a great extent limited by the physical world, right, right.

32:32.040 --> 32:35.960
Now we can, we can really play tricks with the physical world.

32:35.960 --> 32:40.640
And if those tricks they fail, we didn't really kill anyone.

32:40.640 --> 32:52.200
Have you seen any interesting implementations or early results in marrying AI and ARVR?

32:52.200 --> 32:55.280
We have done some experiments.

32:55.280 --> 33:00.800
I think that this is, this is still emerging technology.

33:00.800 --> 33:07.160
There's a lot of things around VR and AR that has not yet really been tried out and not

33:07.160 --> 33:08.560
yet fully understood.

33:08.560 --> 33:09.560
Sure.

33:09.560 --> 33:19.640
But I think that very quickly creators of games and apps in AR and VR are realizing that

33:19.640 --> 33:24.600
they're going to have to step it up a bit, because people expect that natural interaction,

33:24.600 --> 33:25.600
yeah.

33:25.600 --> 33:30.240
So in, in many VR apps and games today, you can, you can pick up an object and you

33:30.240 --> 33:36.840
can maybe throw it, yeah, but you would love that same interaction with other virtual

33:36.840 --> 33:40.200
characters or non-person characters in those games, yeah.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.200
Right.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.040
And you really like to interact with them.

33:43.040 --> 33:47.800
And you want to interact with them in your way and they should be able to respond in

33:47.800 --> 33:53.240
a natural and not, you know, some uncanny way.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.720
And I think we still have some way to go there.

33:55.720 --> 33:56.720
Right.

33:56.720 --> 33:57.720
Right.

33:57.720 --> 34:03.920
Instead of a summary of that one bucket, which is the in-game experience and NVR, AR

34:03.920 --> 34:10.040
experience, is it, it's just super early and you guys are experimenting as are a lot

34:10.040 --> 34:16.160
of people, but, you know, we're still far from, you know, Call of Duty X, whatever the

34:16.160 --> 34:21.920
next version is, being a fully AI enabled game.

34:21.920 --> 34:24.680
Yeah, that's for sure.

34:24.680 --> 34:30.440
The part we're trying to play there is to enable the basic technologies so that our game

34:30.440 --> 34:36.280
developers can start playing with it and sort of evolve it and help us understand what

34:36.280 --> 34:40.080
works and what does not work.

34:40.080 --> 34:49.520
And so how about in the other bucket, where you're applying ML and AI to, you know, more

34:49.520 --> 34:53.600
for, from a business perspective, what are some of the results that you've been able

34:53.600 --> 34:55.600
to achieve there?

34:55.600 --> 34:56.600
Yeah.

34:56.600 --> 35:02.840
So by basically understanding what kind of games people play, just like what kind of

35:02.840 --> 35:06.680
movies you watch and what kind of books you read, you'll be able to understand what kind

35:06.680 --> 35:16.360
of games you play, you're able to pinpoint what's better recommendations or ads for other

35:16.360 --> 35:17.360
games.

35:17.360 --> 35:18.360
Yeah.

35:18.360 --> 35:23.200
So you will, you will, if you always play single shooter games, we, you know, probably

35:23.200 --> 35:29.440
who it would be best off showing you some trailers for other single shooter games, yeah, right?

35:29.440 --> 35:35.400
But that technology is in there that Amazon, that Netflix has been very good at technologies

35:35.400 --> 35:42.880
that basically start exploring your interests, even exploring the things that you maybe

35:42.880 --> 35:46.440
don't even know yet that you're actually interested in.

35:46.440 --> 35:51.760
So basically using machine learning to better get to know you and your game preferences

35:51.760 --> 35:59.840
and make sure that you can discover those games, because there's so many, many, many games

35:59.840 --> 36:06.320
in the app store, yeah, on Google Play, that, so many games that you can't possibly find

36:06.320 --> 36:09.440
all the games that you actually really like, yeah?

36:09.440 --> 36:19.080
So we'll basically learn over time what your preferences are and find those games for

36:19.080 --> 36:21.680
you.

36:21.680 --> 36:31.560
But have you found challenging in applying these technologies at Unity?

36:31.560 --> 36:35.600
And for that matter at previous organizations, what, you know, what are the challenge patterns

36:35.600 --> 36:40.640
that you come up with when you're trying to introduce this or mature it any given organization?

36:40.640 --> 36:41.640
Yeah.

36:41.640 --> 36:48.880
Yeah, that, whether that is Amazon, Uber or Unity technologies, that it's the same all

36:48.880 --> 36:56.320
the way around, and that is that you should not need to be a machine learning expert or

36:56.320 --> 37:00.200
an AI expert to accomplish this.

37:00.200 --> 37:01.200
Right.

37:01.200 --> 37:08.840
You should be able to say, my problem is selling more shoes or selling more books or getting

37:08.840 --> 37:17.840
taxes on time, therefore I should be able to use machine learning services to get there.

37:17.840 --> 37:18.840
Right.

37:18.840 --> 37:22.840
So I thought about it at Amazon, but basically creating as a platform.

37:22.840 --> 37:26.960
We also launched the Amazon machine learning system.

37:26.960 --> 37:32.240
We launched that on Amazon Web Services for the public to use.

37:32.240 --> 37:38.880
And that is very powerful because now you get people with real business problems.

37:38.880 --> 37:44.560
People with real incentives to improve their business using these technologies which

37:44.560 --> 37:52.040
are ways superior to any attempt of trying to write, you know, a thousand lines of C++

37:52.040 --> 37:57.600
code or whatever to solve the problem, yeah, basically based on that data, they can train

37:57.600 --> 38:00.480
computers to do a better job, yeah.

38:00.480 --> 38:07.760
So in all these organizations, it was a matter of making it available in a meaningful way.

38:07.760 --> 38:12.720
And that's what I'm doing at Unity too, is to make sure that game developers do not

38:12.720 --> 38:17.120
have to have a PhD in machine learning to benefit from it.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.120
Right.

38:18.120 --> 38:23.920
What lessons have you learned in building these machine learning platforms at Amazon, Uber

38:23.920 --> 38:27.400
and now Unity?

38:27.400 --> 38:35.480
The lesson, this one big lesson learned which is that it just works really, really well.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.480
Uh-huh.

38:36.480 --> 38:38.360
So make it just work?

38:38.360 --> 38:45.760
But no machine learning does work really well because it does provide results, period.

38:45.760 --> 38:51.320
And there may be a lot of talk about it, there may be a lot of talk about deep learning.

38:51.320 --> 38:52.840
Some people call it hype.

38:52.840 --> 38:57.040
I'm like, yep, you can call it hype, you can call it whatever you want.

38:57.040 --> 39:04.320
But the proof is there that we are able to improve business where we move from a concept

39:04.320 --> 39:12.600
of trying to analyze and investigate and implement to a world where we basically use the data

39:12.600 --> 39:17.320
to improve the business from learning.

39:17.320 --> 39:24.600
And whether that is selling books, driving taxes or developing and playing and selling

39:24.600 --> 39:30.280
games, machine learning is, it really works.

39:30.280 --> 39:38.560
You've been talking to different groups about the notion of bringing machine learning to

39:38.560 --> 39:41.520
every corner of your business.

39:41.520 --> 39:47.840
And to me that suggests not just the obvious places, but maybe some interesting places.

39:47.840 --> 39:54.640
Do you have any stories or examples of interesting corners that you have been able to bring

39:54.640 --> 40:00.600
machine learning and where you found interesting or surprising results?

40:00.600 --> 40:11.120
Yeah, I would say that you often run into business problems.

40:11.120 --> 40:16.960
If you're selling shoes, one of your key business problems is that people get a shoe

40:16.960 --> 40:21.360
online, ordered online, they get a shoe and doesn't fit.

40:21.360 --> 40:26.240
The machine learning is one of these wonderful things where all the return data, all the

40:26.240 --> 40:30.520
shoes that did fit and all the shoes that did not fit.

40:30.520 --> 40:37.480
If you use that data, you can start predicting how different shoes, shoe brands, do they run

40:37.480 --> 40:44.760
large, do they run small or they spot on, you can even start predicting what shoe size

40:44.760 --> 40:53.240
a customer has, and you can basically use that to give a better shoe purchasing experience.

40:53.240 --> 40:58.920
To me that's kind of a surprise, I didn't really think about shoes, but that's when you

40:58.920 --> 41:04.560
enable machine learning into a non-machine learning environment, you will see business

41:04.560 --> 41:06.600
problems popping up.

41:06.600 --> 41:13.240
Another one is, imagine I've seen this being used, I won't be specific, but where machine

41:13.240 --> 41:23.640
learning is used within HR to basically complement one day, maybe even replace performance reviews

41:23.640 --> 41:32.720
and things like that, to predict, to analyze resumes and predict which candidates may be

41:32.720 --> 41:36.800
good and strong future employees.

41:36.800 --> 41:45.680
So areas, it's sort of to me because I've always been on the platform side of this, I get

41:45.680 --> 41:56.640
surprised almost if not daily but then close to daily on what people are using this for.

41:56.640 --> 42:05.640
And that is really what matters, it matters, let's enable a lot of people to use this technology.

42:05.640 --> 42:11.080
So in order to make that vision real, how do you build the right relationship between

42:11.080 --> 42:17.480
the platform people, the data science people, the business people, so that you can kind

42:17.480 --> 42:23.680
of build capacity as an organization that uses machine learning effectively?

42:23.680 --> 42:36.160
Yeah, you need to avoid making this a very custom effort for every single team and for every single use.

42:36.160 --> 42:41.600
That's what it traditionally, that's where it came from, you would have a team that would

42:41.600 --> 42:46.320
have a business need, you would hire data scientists, you would hire machine learning engineers,

42:46.320 --> 42:51.720
you would implement proprietary algorithms and you would maintain those and then you would

42:51.720 --> 42:56.440
need to hire more people as your business scales, et cetera.

42:56.440 --> 43:05.280
And one thing that I did at Uber was to build a machine learning stack from the ground

43:05.280 --> 43:14.840
up entirely based on open source and define it, build it and define it as a platform.

43:14.840 --> 43:19.960
So what I find over the years is that a lot of team come and say, I need this feature,

43:19.960 --> 43:25.000
I need that feature, this is very important, this is very important for me, I need this

43:25.000 --> 43:31.560
other feature, which is even more important for me, well, that's the wrong mindset, because

43:31.560 --> 43:38.040
what they need to do is they need to deploy a lot of machine learning models across their

43:38.040 --> 43:44.160
business rather than just fixating on one particularly one, and I have often seen this

43:44.160 --> 43:52.080
in, say, in fraud detection teams, they would have some very custom algorithms detecting,

43:52.080 --> 43:57.400
you know, certain kind of fraud, and I sort of compared to, you know, you have five locks

43:57.400 --> 44:01.360
on your front door, but you leave all the windows open, yeah.

44:01.360 --> 44:09.400
So these very customized solutions, I think should be something of the past, because

44:09.400 --> 44:15.040
using open source, using standardized algorithms is so much more efficient.

44:15.040 --> 44:21.160
So rather than one magic model, deploy 10 or 50 or 100 different models, right, on your

44:21.160 --> 44:23.160
business.

44:23.160 --> 44:28.880
Can you speak at all to the specific open source tools and projects that you use to build

44:28.880 --> 44:30.360
that platform at Uber?

44:30.360 --> 44:36.600
Absolutely, it's all public, there are slides around if you Google it, but it's essentially

44:36.600 --> 44:48.920
a Hadoop HTFS, Hadoop Spark, things like MLLIP, XG Boost, an open source, very, very versatile

44:48.920 --> 44:58.480
open source algorithm from University of Washington, things like Faye, TensorFlow, Kafka

44:58.480 --> 45:05.800
for streaming, Cassandra for structured data.

45:05.800 --> 45:16.120
You can get really, really far with all those tools combined without any need for really

45:16.120 --> 45:19.360
a deep customization.

45:19.360 --> 45:24.480
And so the platform you built was something that made all of these available, and did

45:24.480 --> 45:31.160
you put some kind of layer on top of it for visualization or automation or how did

45:31.160 --> 45:34.600
you pull all of these disparate tools together?

45:34.600 --> 45:45.080
Yeah, both at Amazon and Uber, the key contribution was essentially a defining, you know, a really

45:45.080 --> 45:53.920
sorted SDK, so people could programmatically integrate with that system, a nice and easy

45:53.920 --> 46:01.320
to use graphical user interface, web-based, browser-based interface, again, because we

46:01.320 --> 46:11.040
want a wide range of users to not feel that the barrier of entry is too higher.

46:11.040 --> 46:16.720
And then, so really the user interface, the SDK side, that's how to access the systems.

46:16.720 --> 46:22.000
And then, at the other end of it, you need to have the system being able to easily access

46:22.000 --> 46:30.120
the data of the company, so you need to integrate on the data side into the data repositories

46:30.120 --> 46:37.200
of the company, whether that is existing, data warehousing, data lakes, you know, relational

46:37.200 --> 46:39.520
databases, etc.

46:39.520 --> 46:49.800
So the stack is really something I would say is not, the stack itself is not as important

46:49.800 --> 46:54.840
as long as it works and runs, but it's sort of that integration on both the front end

46:54.840 --> 46:59.880
and the back end into the business, that's important, because that lowers the barrier

46:59.880 --> 47:00.880
of entry.

47:00.880 --> 47:07.000
It makes it easier for you to build a model if you don't have to track down data from

47:07.000 --> 47:13.360
outside your team.

47:13.360 --> 47:20.520
On the front end of that was the primary user experience like IPython notebook or Jupyter

47:20.520 --> 47:28.040
notebook rather, or were there different ways that developers access the system?

47:28.040 --> 47:36.680
Yeah, there was a total custom user interface, there was also, actually, you could also basically

47:36.680 --> 47:44.400
use things like Jupyter notebook, as long as the system has IPython SDK, you can move that

47:44.400 --> 47:51.800
integration very quickly, and now run your model building jobs from Jupyter, you can

47:51.800 --> 48:00.520
visualize stuff, you can deploy from Jupyter here, so I personally I love Jupyter notebook,

48:00.520 --> 48:06.520
I think it's an incredible tool, a custom user interface, fine too, but most of all

48:06.520 --> 48:15.800
lecturers is the SDKs in multiple languages are important because that allows back-end

48:15.800 --> 48:20.840
engineers to easily integrate machine learning into their offerings.

48:20.840 --> 48:29.560
So if you take the mobile app at Uber, when you open the app app, it suggests one or two

48:29.560 --> 48:37.760
or three likely destinations that you normally go to, that piece, that was actually a piece

48:37.760 --> 48:42.400
of machine learning right there, using your data to build models that predict where you're

48:42.400 --> 48:47.760
going to go on a given day of the week at a given time.

48:47.760 --> 48:48.760
Interesting.

48:48.760 --> 48:55.520
Well, when we spoke previously, you talked a little bit about your vision for really

48:55.520 --> 49:00.840
fully autonomous corporations, what does that mean and what do you envision there?

49:00.840 --> 49:09.040
Yeah, if you follow me on thinking that we can use really deep reinforcement learning

49:09.040 --> 49:18.640
to train an NPC or a Go player, a poker player, yeah, if we can train a computer to use

49:18.640 --> 49:26.680
really deep and complex strategies, including bluffing, if we can train it to do that, then

49:26.680 --> 49:35.440
we can probably also train an agent to say sell books or sell movies, yeah, and become

49:35.440 --> 49:41.960
better and better at it, yeah, I mean like in the end, it should become the best book-selling

49:41.960 --> 49:48.600
agent in the world, yeah, and you can take that further and say, well, the point for

49:48.600 --> 49:53.160
instance, let's just take an example, not only which book should I try to sell, but what

49:53.160 --> 49:54.960
should the prices be?

49:54.960 --> 49:55.960
Right.

49:55.960 --> 50:00.120
Imagine that you use reinforcement learning to figure out what is the right price to sell

50:00.120 --> 50:07.560
stuff at, yeah, and what is the right time to order books at so that we don't run out

50:07.560 --> 50:12.160
of book for logistics reasons, yeah, when should we order the parts to build, you know,

50:12.160 --> 50:18.560
our Xbox, our Kindle, our hardware, yeah, if you look at a lot of, you know,

50:18.560 --> 50:28.160
problems that humans are solving in corporations today, I think many of those problems can

50:28.160 --> 50:37.000
be learned and solved by a computer, if you take reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement

50:37.000 --> 50:42.480
learning as we know it today as a starting point, and basically just think a little out

50:42.480 --> 50:45.640
there, why not?

50:45.640 --> 50:50.200
Right, right, yeah, I think what's interesting about that to me is that we often think

50:50.200 --> 50:59.040
about this AGI artificial general intelligence as this kind of one Uber AI that, you know,

50:59.040 --> 51:06.120
it's just very human-like and can reason and, you know, do everything, but you're describing

51:06.120 --> 51:13.120
a, you know, something that could create tremendous value that is, you know, much less ambitious,

51:13.120 --> 51:20.080
right? It's a collection of, of, of AIs that are more purpose built, and we should be able

51:20.080 --> 51:23.000
to get there, you know, a lot quicker.

51:23.000 --> 51:29.800
Yeah, I, I, I, I'm kind of struggling with the whole AGI debate, sort of maybe, you

51:29.800 --> 51:37.040
know, plus one or plus two out there for me, but I do think that there is an interesting

51:37.040 --> 51:44.360
perspective in, if we envision a world where reinforcement learning, I'm using that as

51:44.360 --> 51:48.720
sort of a very general term here, yeah, but there will, you know, be many different variations

51:48.720 --> 51:57.400
of it, but we do envision a world where a company like Amazon used that, not, you know,

51:57.400 --> 52:07.400
to selling books, not just in 10 places, but they use it 5,000 parts of their company,

52:07.400 --> 52:13.440
yeah, they use it everywhere, right? And you start having these systems interacting,

52:13.440 --> 52:24.080
you know, at one point, when you add it all up, you get more than the sum, yeah, because

52:24.080 --> 52:30.480
now you're going to get the effect of, I'm in really good at selling, I'm really good

52:30.480 --> 52:37.040
at finding the right price point to maximize revenue, I'm really good at understanding

52:37.040 --> 52:43.920
what people want, I'm really good at understanding ordering all the parts and components in time,

52:43.920 --> 52:48.800
so that I never run out, et cetera, et cetera, and something you have sort of a whole product

52:48.800 --> 52:58.400
pipeline happening, yeah, with very limited human intervention, yeah, is that a GI? I

52:58.400 --> 53:03.360
don't think people think of that, but is that looking like a super intelligent corporation?

53:03.360 --> 53:11.880
Yeah, yeah, it strikes me that there's a whole field of study and research that would

53:11.880 --> 53:17.080
need to happen to allow us to manage this thing, like apply, it's almost the application

53:17.080 --> 53:23.000
of traditional control systems work to these independent AI systems, like hysteresis,

53:23.000 --> 53:27.840
so you don't over or under order or order to aggressively, or it's just a whole layer

53:27.840 --> 53:32.280
that needs to happen there that we're clearly, yeah, not there yet.

53:32.280 --> 53:38.440
Yeah, I totally agree with that observation, and I also think that, and we start seeing

53:38.440 --> 53:48.520
this in some papers coming out, I do see a shift in some research that now goes more towards

53:49.720 --> 54:00.360
researching the strategy around teaching computers, yeah, so basically examples are like if I give

54:00.360 --> 54:05.960
a reinforcement learning algorithm, give it too hard of a problem to begin with, it's not going

54:05.960 --> 54:12.920
to solve it, yeah, but if I sort of give it, you know, increasingly difficult problems to solve,

54:13.640 --> 54:20.040
it gets really good at it, yeah, so that's kind of learning strategies, and so we're not talking

54:20.040 --> 54:23.720
about, we're not talking about the technology here, we're not talking about, you know, this

54:23.720 --> 54:28.360
particular structure of a deep neural net or something like that, we're just talking about

54:28.360 --> 54:34.520
how do I best teach a computer, and their company is looking at how can I minimize the

54:34.520 --> 54:39.800
need for data, because data can be, you know, difficult to get by, so there's a way I can,

54:39.800 --> 54:47.160
I can learn more efficiently, so if you think about some of these research topics are kind of

54:47.160 --> 54:53.000
at a meta level, yeah, so far we have been so eager to study algorithms and methods,

54:54.200 --> 54:59.400
but maybe a lot of the future research is really about what, what does a good school for

54:59.400 --> 55:06.280
computers look like, interesting, interesting, well as we wind down any parting thoughts or words

55:06.280 --> 55:16.200
for our audience, I think that the audience should look at the gaming and the gaming platforms as

55:16.200 --> 55:25.960
a fantastic lap for AI that's going to give us a peek into the future, because if you think about

55:25.960 --> 55:35.000
NPCs moving around in a game, you know, they are really robots, yeah, robots in the physical world,

55:35.000 --> 55:41.000
they take, you know, easily year to two years to build, yeah, and they're expensive, very expensive,

55:41.000 --> 55:48.200
lots of mechanical engineering, yeah, but if you think about an NPC in a computer game,

55:48.200 --> 55:54.680
that's pretty much the robot too, you can evolve them quickly, you can try out different, you know,

55:54.680 --> 56:03.880
dimensions, different mechanisms, everything can happen at, you know, surreal speeds, yeah,

56:03.880 --> 56:11.800
compared to the real world, so I think that the way I look at the gaming world is way beyond gaming,

56:11.800 --> 56:16.920
I'm looking at it as like what is going to be possible in the physical world, you know,

56:16.920 --> 56:21.320
five, ten years from now, well that may be possible in the gaming world next week.

56:21.320 --> 56:28.280
