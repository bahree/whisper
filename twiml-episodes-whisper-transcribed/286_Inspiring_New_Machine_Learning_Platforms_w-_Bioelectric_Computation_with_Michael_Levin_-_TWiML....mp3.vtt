Looking forward to seeing you there.

01:39.920 --> 01:44.920
All right, everyone. I am here with Michael Levin.

01:44.920 --> 01:51.520
Michael is a professor of biology and director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts University.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.120
Michael, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.320
Thank you so much, pleasure to be here.

01:56.320 --> 02:03.960
So you gave a talk just this afternoon to a gigantic room here at the Neurops conference.

02:03.960 --> 02:10.080
Your talk was on a couple of themes that I have found fascinating just from the summary

02:10.080 --> 02:16.760
of it, developmental bioelectricity and some of the implications for machine learning.

02:16.760 --> 02:20.240
Why don't we have you get started by telling us a little bit about your background and

02:20.240 --> 02:22.320
then we'll dive into the topic of your talk.

02:22.320 --> 02:23.320
Sure.

02:23.320 --> 02:25.160
My background originally was computer science.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.200
I did software engineering for a number of years.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.320
I got an undergrad degree in computer science.

02:30.320 --> 02:34.440
I then went to graduate school for biology.

02:34.440 --> 02:40.880
So I have a PhD in genetics and then I did postdoctoral training in cell biology and my lab

02:40.880 --> 02:45.960
does a number of things in developmental biology and regenerative biology and computer science

02:45.960 --> 02:51.040
all around the theme of information processing and computation in living systems.

02:51.040 --> 02:56.240
So we are interested in how living biological systems process information and compute at

02:56.240 --> 03:00.240
all scales, molecular tissue level, cell level, behavioral and so on.

03:00.240 --> 03:07.920
Maybe you can give us kind of a broad survey of what the current thinking is around biological

03:07.920 --> 03:08.920
computation.

03:08.920 --> 03:11.040
It's not something that I've had a lot of exposure to.

03:11.040 --> 03:17.280
No, and this is very much an emerging field and in fact there are lots of divergent opinions

03:17.280 --> 03:19.000
and approaches at this point in this area.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.280
It's a very exciting time.

03:21.280 --> 03:28.960
My particular area comes in trying to understand how cells and tissues interact to revise the

03:28.960 --> 03:30.960
anatomical plan of the body.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.960
So we all start life as a single cell.

03:32.960 --> 03:38.280
The fertilized egg gives rise to a bunch of early embryonic cells and these have to arrange

03:38.280 --> 03:40.800
themselves into a particular anatomical structure.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.000
So it might be a tree or a snake or an elephant or a human or whatever.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.520
But all of these cells have to figure out what to do to make this appropriate structure and

03:47.520 --> 03:50.200
in fact it's much more than simply creating that structure.

03:50.200 --> 03:55.240
Some animals are highly regenerative which means that you can for example if certain body

03:55.240 --> 04:00.880
parts are amputated they will regrow those parts, so salamanders will regrow legs and

04:00.880 --> 04:03.920
eyes and jaws and portions of the brain.

04:03.920 --> 04:09.200
And these kind of examples and many others that I show today illustrate a remarkable capability

04:09.200 --> 04:15.480
of biological systems to do flexible dynamic remodeling that is they don't simply create

04:15.480 --> 04:21.680
a structure as some sort of a pre-written set of instructions but they can modify on

04:21.680 --> 04:26.560
the fly to repair towards a particular goal state, a coherent organism.

04:26.560 --> 04:31.120
So when a salamander regenerates its limb for example, it stops exactly when the limb

04:31.120 --> 04:33.480
reaches its correct size and shape.

04:33.480 --> 04:38.240
And so the question then for regenerative medicine is not only to try to trigger this

04:38.240 --> 04:42.800
kind of regenerative ability, we certainly work on this in our lab is to try to kickstart

04:42.800 --> 04:47.760
regeneration in human patients down the line but also to understand how the whole system

04:47.760 --> 04:55.080
knows when to stop and for us regeneration is primarily a computational problem, the

04:55.080 --> 04:59.240
tissues need to know that they've been damaged, they need to know what to do to repair and

04:59.240 --> 05:00.520
they need to know when it's done.

05:00.520 --> 05:05.520
And these are all questions that really are very much not understood today.

05:05.520 --> 05:10.320
This is kind of blowing my mind I think for those of us outside of the field of biology

05:10.320 --> 05:15.920
like we know that bodies do these things and you know the answer is just oh it's DNA right

05:15.920 --> 05:21.160
the DNA controls all of this stuff but to think of it as a computational process that's

05:21.160 --> 05:23.800
a totally new way of thinking about it for me.

05:23.800 --> 05:28.840
Yeah so this is very common and in fact so I gave a version of this talk to a bunch

05:28.840 --> 05:33.880
of middle school kids last year and I asked them I showed them a picture of an egg and I asked

05:33.880 --> 05:38.080
them what actually determines what comes out of this egg it could be a snake, a turtle,

05:38.080 --> 05:42.360
a dinosaur or whatever and even the nine year olds all said DNA it's DNA.

05:42.360 --> 05:49.680
Well in a certain sense it is DNA but the thing to realize is that if in this age of genomics

05:49.680 --> 05:56.120
if you actually sequence the genome understand the genome says has information about proteins

05:56.120 --> 05:58.960
there is nothing directly that you could read out of a genome that would tell you how

05:58.960 --> 06:04.280
many limbs and the creature was going to have or what type of a body symmetry it was going

06:04.280 --> 06:08.560
to have whether it was going to be regenerative or not or any of these other things there

06:08.560 --> 06:13.680
none of this is directly encoded in the DNA what you see in the DNA is just the proteins.

06:13.680 --> 06:18.320
How do we know like have we cracked the code to I mean we know we can sequence the genome

06:18.320 --> 06:23.880
and know the protein sequence but how do we know that that isn't somehow encoding

06:23.880 --> 06:27.440
you know some of these more discrete properties.

06:27.440 --> 06:32.800
Well it's a subtle thing so what the DNA I'll jump right into the kind of the middle

06:32.800 --> 06:37.960
of the talk so what I did at the beginning of the talk was to try to set up a couple

06:37.960 --> 06:43.000
of things that may be surprising to people so one is this amazing ability of bodies to

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
repair themselves.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.680
I showed one for example this creature known as the planarion flatworm and these flatworms

06:48.680 --> 06:52.440
are able to regenerate any part of their body so they can be chopped into pieces.

06:52.440 --> 06:56.520
Every piece knows what a complete planarion looks like it regrows exactly what's necessary

06:56.520 --> 06:57.840
no more no less.

06:57.840 --> 07:02.960
I also showed unicellular organisms that have one cell that are just a no brain just one

07:02.960 --> 07:08.400
cell but that are incredibly adept at behavior at changing their body changing their structure

07:08.400 --> 07:13.280
in order to fit their environment and so on so I tried to get across the importance of

07:13.280 --> 07:17.400
understanding this kind of decision making in biological tissues.

07:17.400 --> 07:23.040
Now the DNA code has been cracked we know we know exactly what the DNA actually encodes

07:23.040 --> 07:25.080
the DNA actually encodes proteins.

07:25.080 --> 07:30.360
Now down the line of course in an important sense the DNA produces everything you need

07:30.360 --> 07:34.160
for the hardware of the body so the proteins that are in the genome that's what your

07:34.160 --> 07:38.480
body is going to be made of okay so so hardware is critical without hardware you get nothing

07:38.480 --> 07:44.000
however hardware is only half the story so the hardware that is produced by the DNA some

07:44.000 --> 07:49.880
of these proteins are electrical conduits known as ion channels and the thing about these

07:49.880 --> 07:55.000
ion channels is they can operate as little transistors they can some of them are voltage

07:55.000 --> 07:59.400
gated current conductances just like transistors and this means that the hardware produced

07:59.400 --> 08:04.360
by that genome is electrically active and it's not only electrically active but the circuits

08:04.360 --> 08:09.600
that are present in these cells produce some very complex behaviors that allow symmetry

08:09.600 --> 08:15.720
breaking self-organization and decision making in terms of pattern control at the large

08:15.720 --> 08:22.320
scale so whole tissues whole organs whole appendages of bodies so so yes the DNA is critical

08:22.320 --> 08:26.120
in that it establishes the hardware but the software that runs on this hardware is

08:26.120 --> 08:31.720
not directly encoded anywhere in the DNA it is the result of the electrical activity another

08:31.720 --> 08:38.160
way the DNA establishes the hardware which creates the software that controls all these things

08:38.160 --> 08:41.840
essentially there's a there's a default software that will run on this hardware if it's

08:41.840 --> 08:47.240
unperturbed but the cool thing about the software is that it's very it's very plastic and

08:47.240 --> 08:51.640
it's written and and it operates in such a way that it's it makes it very easy for us

08:51.640 --> 08:56.760
to rewrite it and so that means that we can intervene and I show numerous examples of

08:56.760 --> 09:02.120
of us learning to intervene in the software to make the to make the body into shapes that

09:02.120 --> 09:09.480
are entirely not what the genome default is so for talking about things like crisper or not

09:09.480 --> 09:14.600
at all no so no genomic and once again no not whatsoever so the interesting thing about this

09:14.600 --> 09:19.560
approach what makes it different is that another point I tried to make in the talk is that

09:19.560 --> 09:24.680
computer science the reason the reason computer science was able to drive this incredible

09:24.680 --> 09:30.120
revolution in information technology is that we moved from having to program at the level of

09:30.120 --> 09:33.720
hardware which is where we were in the 40s you know if you wanted to program a computer you had

09:33.720 --> 09:38.600
to get in there and shift wires around that was how we program but now because of the appreciation

09:38.600 --> 09:44.600
of the hardware software distinction we are able to work at these in these high level programming

09:44.600 --> 09:48.600
formalisms where you can think about the information flow the algorithm and you're not worried about

09:48.600 --> 09:53.640
what the underlying hardware is because if the hardware is good enough it can run lots of different

09:53.640 --> 09:57.720
kinds of software and at that point you can forget about the hardware and really focus on the algorithm

09:57.720 --> 10:03.160
our biological hardware is good enough it is it is complex enough that it is able to run all

10:03.160 --> 10:08.440
sorts of interesting physiological software there is some default that comes with if you don't touch

10:08.440 --> 10:14.280
it this is what it's going to do but it is also a label such that we can rewrite it and so what I've

10:14.280 --> 10:21.240
shown is rewriting the software without touching the hardware meaning control what happens by input

10:21.240 --> 10:25.800
and experience rather than by changing the circuitry the there are two analogies that I will put

10:25.800 --> 10:31.880
in forward one is at this point we program the compute we program our computers not by getting

10:31.880 --> 10:36.280
in there and melting bits of silicon here and there but we have a keyboard we have a way of

10:36.280 --> 10:41.400
entering information not re not rewiring the the physical hardware so everybody understands

10:41.400 --> 10:45.400
that the same piece of hardware if it's if it's decent can run lots of different types of software

10:45.400 --> 10:50.600
and the way you change it is by providing inputs that shift the electrical dynamics of the system

10:50.600 --> 10:56.920
without having to change the structure of it the other analogies with the brain so the DNA certainly

10:56.920 --> 11:01.400
includes all of the proteins instructions for all of the proteins that are required to make up your

11:01.400 --> 11:06.440
brain but the information content of your brain is nowhere in the genome and you couldn't dream of

11:06.440 --> 11:11.880
reading out the content of a person's memories and their mind or animals by looking at the genome

11:11.880 --> 11:16.360
what you may recover from the genome is some default instinctual behavior so for example

11:17.080 --> 11:21.640
let's say some insects wasps you know they're born knowing how to build a you know a thing to catch

11:21.640 --> 11:28.360
prey and all this so the genome certainly gives rise to a neural network whose default behavior

11:28.360 --> 11:34.120
includes these kinds of interesting things that insects do but other animals are also able to

11:34.120 --> 11:39.080
learn and this means that you can have experiential inputs information that they get through the

11:39.080 --> 11:44.200
visual through other senses that radically change what their behavior is going to be down the line

11:44.920 --> 11:49.240
many circuits in the body have this kind of interesting plastic property so some of the things

11:49.240 --> 11:53.880
that I've shown today for example one of the one of the examples was we can take a flatworm

11:53.880 --> 11:59.640
that has a very particular shaped head and we can very transiently briefly alter the electrical

11:59.640 --> 12:05.880
properties of that of that animal such that when it regenerates a new head it will make heads

12:05.880 --> 12:11.240
appropriate to other species of flatworms other species 150 million years different so the shape

12:11.240 --> 12:15.400
of the head is different the shape of the brain is different the stem cell distribution is

12:15.400 --> 12:21.000
appropriate to a completely different animal 150 million years distant the genome is untouched

12:21.000 --> 12:26.120
there's that we did not touch the genomic sequence because what the genomic sequence encodes

12:26.120 --> 12:31.160
is a body that can build a number of different types of structures one of those structures is this

12:31.160 --> 12:38.280
other type of plenary and head I've shown other examples where we can induce different parts of

12:38.280 --> 12:43.560
the body so for example we can make a chunk of the gut of a frog embryo become an eye and again

12:43.560 --> 12:48.120
this is this is the same thing because one of the things these electrical as it turns out

12:48.680 --> 12:54.440
one of the things these electrical networks do is they specify large scale anatomical

12:54.440 --> 13:01.240
decisions for the body and so the decision of what organ shall I make at any given space in

13:01.240 --> 13:06.760
the any given location in the body is dictated by the outcome of a complex electrical circuit

13:06.760 --> 13:10.680
downstream of that electrical circuit are all the familiar things people have heard about so

13:10.680 --> 13:16.040
transcriptional cascades genes turning on and off physical forces tension stresses between cells

13:16.040 --> 13:23.640
cells moving around chromatin states so all of these kinds of things but many of these important

13:23.640 --> 13:27.560
decisions are made upstream by an electrical circuit and we have the opportunity to intervene

13:28.200 --> 13:34.600
and I've shown I showed a number of examples of this where we can repair things that for example

13:35.400 --> 13:41.160
animals in which defects have been induced in genes that are required for brain development for

13:41.160 --> 13:48.360
example so we showed a is a bioelectrical fix which is a strategy that repairs their brain so

13:48.360 --> 13:54.040
basically by forcing the appropriate electrical states in that region of the body they will build

13:54.040 --> 13:57.800
a correct brain with the correct structure correct function and even correct behavior so

13:57.800 --> 14:01.960
these animals get their IQs back despite the fact that they've had a genetic mutation that

14:01.960 --> 14:07.800
normally takes out the brain completely or that they've been exposed to a variety of

14:07.800 --> 14:12.520
horrible toeratogens that normally cause really terrible defects so there's the genome there's

14:12.520 --> 14:17.560
the default set of things that happen normally but that layer is very rich and we get to intervene

14:17.560 --> 14:22.680
and make a number of changes this is incredible this kind of suggests that at least at some point

14:23.240 --> 14:28.040
you know there's a possibility of bioelectric medicine or we have any you know for humans do we

14:28.040 --> 14:33.160
have any you know early indications of that being possible yeah very much so so so we're working

14:33.160 --> 14:38.440
exactly on this we're working on applications like limb regeneration tumor reprogramming repair

14:38.440 --> 14:44.120
of birth defects all of these things I think are going to be part of human medicine and one of

14:44.120 --> 14:50.840
the important things is that something like 20% of all drugs are ion channels blockers or activators

14:50.840 --> 14:55.800
so this means that there's a huge kind of already of starting to do this well not so so they're

14:55.800 --> 15:00.680
all used for things like cardiac arrhythmias epilepsy so so people use them to target neurons

15:00.680 --> 15:09.160
but my big message today was that neurons are simply a sped up a sort of accelerated version

15:09.160 --> 15:15.960
of much more primitive ancient cells so cells were were were processing information in networks

15:15.960 --> 15:20.760
long before brains and neurons came on the scene and while all of these drugs right now are being

15:21.960 --> 15:28.760
are being developed for problems in in cardiac and neural and neural kinds of syndromes they form

15:28.760 --> 15:34.760
this amazing toolkit of electrosuticals that we've begun to apply them towards problems in tumor

15:34.760 --> 15:39.800
reprogramming regenerative induction repair and so on and so I absolutely think this is going

15:39.800 --> 15:45.320
to be part of human medicine yeah one of the things that you were talking about in your talk

15:45.320 --> 15:51.080
was this notion of right rewriting pattern memories is that you know this general concept that

15:51.080 --> 15:55.720
we've been discussing or is there is more specific meaning to that well I can give you a specific

15:55.720 --> 16:02.440
example but it's part of that same that same idea one of the things that we we we know is that

16:02.440 --> 16:08.200
even our unicellular ancestors so single cells before they became multicellular already had

16:08.200 --> 16:14.040
a lot of the machinery that we associate with decision making and cognition so synaptic proteins

16:14.040 --> 16:19.400
eye on channels um neuro transmitters these things are extremely ancient and cells and tissues

16:19.400 --> 16:26.600
were processing this information before we had brains uh this is um the the the the way that they

16:26.600 --> 16:32.920
that they do this is by storing a bioelectric prepatterns that are um guideposts for what they're

16:32.920 --> 16:38.760
going to do if they're damaged so we I show today an example where we can take a flower and in an

16:38.760 --> 16:43.560
intact flower you can actually see we've developed techniques to visualize some of these electrical

16:43.560 --> 16:48.840
memories we can see these as stable electrical states and tissues and we can go in and rewrite them

16:48.840 --> 16:53.240
and when we rewrite them what happens is initially nothing because that that memory is latent

16:53.240 --> 16:57.160
it's not being used but if that animal gets injured in the future so let's say we cut its head

16:57.160 --> 17:01.800
and its tail off that middle fragment with a rewritten pattern memory will then go on to

17:02.680 --> 17:07.960
regenerate two heads one at each end so no tail two heads at each end and this is because we gave

17:07.960 --> 17:12.360
it a false memory we gave it a false now this is a different kind of memory it's not the kind of

17:12.360 --> 17:16.600
memory that lives in the brain about behavior this is a memory that's distributed across the whole

17:16.600 --> 17:22.120
body that determines the behavior of the cells as they will try to recreate what they think a worm

17:22.120 --> 17:26.200
looks like and this representation of the fact that a worm is supposed to have one head and one

17:26.200 --> 17:31.800
tail is not set in stone we can rewrite it and that's what we've done it also calls to mind the

17:31.800 --> 17:39.800
whole idea of biological memory systems like the you know the human brain from a kind of storage

17:39.800 --> 17:46.760
perspective is a way more efficient memory store than DRAM you know that we use in computers is

17:46.760 --> 17:52.680
are there clear implications to that yes I absolutely so there are a number of applications of

17:52.680 --> 17:58.920
this work to machine learning into AI in general certainly living tissue is an incredibly dense

17:58.920 --> 18:05.320
information medium there are networks made of cells within with inside of each cell there are

18:05.320 --> 18:10.920
incredibly complex molecular and also some some cellular networks things like the cytoskeleton

18:10.920 --> 18:17.000
which process information in a distributed fashion in an incredibly dense and rich way so so I

18:17.000 --> 18:23.480
think as as new media as new excitable unconventional media for computation biological tissues have

18:23.480 --> 18:27.160
a lot to teach us I think that's that's absolutely true the other the is some of the other

18:27.160 --> 18:37.480
implications are that biological systems are very very good at adaptively altering their behavior

18:37.480 --> 18:43.480
and function in light of novel stressors so the the the problem that we a or a problem that we

18:43.480 --> 18:47.240
currently have in machine learning where some of these applications are really brittle the very

18:47.240 --> 18:51.240
good at doing one thing you shift them to a slightly different problem and everything falls apart

18:51.240 --> 18:55.720
living things are the exact opposite of that we have many examples of living structures that can

18:56.440 --> 19:03.480
adaptively respond to novel stressors in in a very kind of efficient way and and this is

19:03.480 --> 19:07.320
something that we badly need in in robotics and machine learning and I think we're going to be able

19:07.320 --> 19:11.800
to get that by observing how cells and tissues make decisions in the kinds of experiments that we

19:11.800 --> 19:19.640
deal with a lot of the mechanisms of machine learning are you know the manipulation of probability

19:19.640 --> 19:28.440
distributions do these kinds of bioelectric systems and signals within within the body or other

19:28.440 --> 19:35.080
organisms do they exhibit the same kind same kind of probabilistic nature they do they do so so

19:35.080 --> 19:41.800
we've we've we've characterized several kinds of stochastic decision making but pretty much we

19:41.800 --> 19:49.000
have a we have an interesting review on this on this whole question pretty much every major concept

19:49.000 --> 19:55.320
in neuroscience and cognitive science that we've been able to find has an analog in somatic

19:55.320 --> 20:00.920
decision making so everything you can think of from from memories to optical illusions to false

20:00.920 --> 20:08.520
memories to forgetting to inference to making mistakes to calculating forward do for expectations

20:08.520 --> 20:14.600
in terms of anticipation all of these concepts and many more have exact analogs outside the body

20:14.600 --> 20:18.840
and I think one outside the brain rather and I think one of the major implications of all this

20:18.840 --> 20:26.040
is that in developing new AI and machine learning technologies we should not be trying to mimic

20:26.040 --> 20:33.480
the human brain I think that a focus on architectures that try to mimic specific regions of the brain

20:33.480 --> 20:39.640
or specific processes in the brain or or specific architectures really looking at one very narrow

20:39.640 --> 20:44.840
and and fairly recent evolutionary development the the kinds of things that we really want which

20:44.840 --> 20:51.640
is robust distributed highly plastic performance and decision making these were things that were

20:51.640 --> 20:57.080
invented long before brains came on the scene and those those basic mechanisms still remain to be

20:57.880 --> 21:05.880
investigated and implemented in in machine learning. Are there any kind of concrete examples of

21:05.880 --> 21:12.040
the intersection of machine learning and developmental bio electricity to date or are you projecting

21:12.040 --> 21:16.760
into the future into a direction we need to go? There's two I think there's two branches of this

21:16.760 --> 21:21.880
on the one hand it's the question of what can machine learning do for regenerative medicine

21:21.880 --> 21:28.680
and we have begun to develop and we need a lot more help with this and a lot more progress is

21:28.680 --> 21:35.080
available this is a hugely exciting frontier area of using machine learning technology and

21:35.080 --> 21:42.840
strategies to help developmental biologists solve the problem of of pattern control what we what

21:42.840 --> 21:49.720
biologists are very very good at is characterizing the molecular details of the hardware we are

21:49.720 --> 21:55.000
basically where computer science was in the 40s all we do is try to interface with the hardware

21:55.000 --> 22:00.440
we try to push push around single molecules you know whether the the the fanciest papers in nature

22:00.440 --> 22:04.440
are all about how somebody can do something at single molecule resolution this is what we're very

22:04.440 --> 22:10.680
good at or terrible at is solving the inverse problem of asking what do we need to tweak at the

22:10.680 --> 22:15.720
low level to get a desired systems level outcome so if somebody's if if we have a fetus that's

22:15.720 --> 22:22.360
going to have three fingers instead of five the question of what exactly do we need to tweak at

22:22.360 --> 22:27.560
the lowest level to get a particular outcome or to fix a certain organ or the shape of the face

22:27.560 --> 22:34.680
or something like this we're actually really really bad at that and so using meanwhile the data

22:34.680 --> 22:40.840
on these low level pathways grows exponentially so so people keep sequencing things the the this

22:40.840 --> 22:47.880
kind of deep data is just increasing in an incredible fashion but but this is already exceeded

22:47.880 --> 22:53.800
the human ability to synthesize all of these data into some sort of model that can be that can

22:53.800 --> 22:58.920
be reversed so that we can ask what would we have to do to get a particular anatomical outcome

22:58.920 --> 23:03.400
so machine learning tools to help us with this problem are absolutely essential for regenerative

23:03.400 --> 23:07.800
medicine to move forward in and we've had a little bit of success with us we've developed some

23:08.680 --> 23:13.880
some genetic algorithm based machine learning platforms that have actually helped us discover

23:13.880 --> 23:18.760
models of how some of these things work it's it's kind of amazing we we made what I think is the

23:18.760 --> 23:25.240
first is a couple years ago what I think is the first example of a model in developmental biology

23:25.240 --> 23:29.960
that was discovered by a non-human intelligence so basically of a platform that was able to

23:29.960 --> 23:34.280
derive a model not just crunch the numbers but actually come up with a theory of what was going

23:34.280 --> 23:39.000
on what was going on inside that plenary and flatworm that was better able to explain all the

23:39.000 --> 23:42.760
experiments than existing models that humans have come up with so I think this is the tip of the

23:42.760 --> 23:49.080
iceberg we have to do do better with this and give people tools to help extract wisdom from

23:49.080 --> 23:53.480
this mountain of data that we have going in the opposite direction this is really just starting

23:53.480 --> 23:58.200
and I don't have anything specific to point to other than people have started to look at things

23:58.200 --> 24:05.320
like slime molds like ant colonies like bacterial biofilms as models for computation and there are

24:05.320 --> 24:11.880
people like Andrew Ratamatsky and others who are using some of these kinds of unconventional media

24:11.880 --> 24:18.120
as a very simple computers with the idea of understanding how they do what they do and trying to

24:19.000 --> 24:23.640
implement some of these advantages in robotics and and we're doing this too we have collaborations

24:23.640 --> 24:28.440
with people like Josh Bondgard at University of Vermont who make robots and trying to really

24:28.440 --> 24:33.560
squeeze some some insights out of these biological systems for much better technology.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.680
Really fascinating work Michael thanks so much for taking the time to share with us any kind of

24:40.680 --> 24:46.200
final thoughts or suggestions for folks that want to dig into this in a little bit more detail.

24:46.200 --> 24:51.080
Yeah the biggest thing I can I can suggest is to drop me an email because we are always very

24:51.080 --> 24:54.760
interested in collaborating with people from the machine learning community I think there are

24:54.760 --> 25:01.080
huge opportunities in both directions for enriching the progress and so you can reach me at

25:01.080 --> 25:07.800

25:07.800 --> 25:12.120
all of the all of the data we have there's a lot of code that we've written and I would love to

25:12.120 --> 25:16.280
talk to experts in this field for working together. Fantastic thanks so much Michael thank you very
