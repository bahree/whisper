Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

00:15.920 --> 00:20.880
people doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.240
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:23.240 --> 00:28.440
I'd like to start off this show by sending out a huge thank you to everyone listening.

00:28.440 --> 00:32.800
We've dropped a ton of great interviews over the past few weeks and through your dedication

00:32.800 --> 00:39.040
we continue to see a growing outpouring of feedback comments and shares with each release.

00:39.040 --> 00:43.580
If you're a regular listener but don't normally send in feedback we'd really love to hear

00:43.580 --> 00:44.580
from you.

00:44.580 --> 00:50.520
So please head on over to Apple Podcasts or wherever you listen and leave us a review.

00:50.520 --> 00:55.760
A 5 star review is of course appreciated but what's most important is that your voice

00:55.760 --> 00:56.960
is heard.

00:56.960 --> 01:01.800
It lets us know what you like or what you feel we can improve on and it also lets those

01:01.800 --> 01:06.880
looking for a new machine learning and AI podcast know that they should join the Twimble

01:06.880 --> 01:09.120
community.

01:09.120 --> 01:15.040
Speaking of community, the details of our next Twimble online meetup have been posted.

01:15.040 --> 01:22.440
On Tuesday November 14th at 3pm Pacific time, we'll be joined by Kevin T who will be presenting

01:22.440 --> 01:28.120
his paper, active preference learning for personalized portfolio construction.

01:28.120 --> 01:32.000
If you've already registered for the meetup, you should have received an invitation

01:32.000 --> 01:33.960
with all the details.

01:33.960 --> 01:39.840
If you still need to register, head on over to twimbleai.com slash meetup to do so.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.480
We hope to see you there.

01:41.480 --> 01:45.800
Now as some of you may know, we spent a few days last week in New York City hosted by

01:45.800 --> 01:49.120
our great friends at NYU Future Labs.

01:49.120 --> 01:53.920
About six months ago, we covered their inaugural AI Summit, an event they hosted to showcase

01:53.920 --> 01:58.960
the startups in the first batch of their AI Nexus Lab program, as well as the impressive

01:58.960 --> 02:02.040
AI talent in the New York City ecosystem.

02:02.040 --> 02:06.160
While we were more than excited when we found out they would be having a second summit

02:06.160 --> 02:11.360
so soon, this time we had the pleasure of interviewing the four startups of the second

02:11.360 --> 02:19.080
AI Nexus Lab batch, Mount Clevverist, Bite.ai, Second Mind, and Bowtie Labs.

02:19.080 --> 02:23.800
We also interviewed a bunch of the speakers from the event and will be sharing those discussions

02:23.800 --> 02:25.880
over the upcoming weeks.

02:25.880 --> 02:31.280
In this show, I speak with Cool Singh, CEO and founder of Second Mind.

02:31.280 --> 02:36.200
Second Mind is building an integration platform for businesses that allows them to bring augmented

02:36.200 --> 02:39.000
intelligence to voice conversations.

02:39.000 --> 02:43.520
We talked to Cool about the concept behind Second Mind and how the company combines ambient

02:43.520 --> 02:48.440
listening with a low latency matching system to help users eliminate an estimated two

02:48.440 --> 02:53.640
and a half hours of manual searches per day, and now on to the show.

02:53.640 --> 03:07.920
All right, everyone, I am here at NYU Future Labs, speaking with some of the AI Nexus startups,

03:07.920 --> 03:13.480
and I am with Cool Singh right now, founder and CEO of Second Mind.

03:13.480 --> 03:16.080
Cool, welcome to this week in Machine Learning and AI.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.080
Thank you.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.080
It's a great time.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.840
How do we get started by having you tell me a little bit about your background?

03:20.840 --> 03:21.840
Sure.

03:21.840 --> 03:29.480
I came to New York as a derivatives trader, and so I was doing what was considered now

03:29.480 --> 03:31.480
with considered AI back then.

03:31.480 --> 03:37.320
We were doing AI's effectively expected value, and we were doing very intensive Monte Carlos

03:37.320 --> 03:42.480
simulations and doing from mortgage derivatives and other structured type products.

03:42.480 --> 03:46.760
So that was where I started, and then I took doing that and building the systems that

03:46.760 --> 03:50.080
I was on the trading side, but building the systems on that, I got an interest in technology,

03:50.080 --> 03:55.080
and I started two companies that were in the low latency side of it.

03:55.080 --> 04:00.920
So two technology companies, and basically one company is actually still operational with

04:00.920 --> 04:05.560
the product still being adopted across many enterprises, Fortune 100 companies, and I have

04:05.560 --> 04:09.320
two patents in terms of low latency systems.

04:09.320 --> 04:14.440
And then I actually started a lab with a team in Ukraine and Eastern Europe that was focused

04:14.440 --> 04:15.440
on NLP and AI.

04:15.440 --> 04:21.720
That sort of built back, and it's early in terms of NLP, but they've been doing it for

04:21.720 --> 04:24.760
a while, but built early shop bots around travel and some other things.

04:24.760 --> 04:28.720
So I've been doing this for a while, and then I started having an interest in an idea

04:28.720 --> 04:31.880
around this particular company's second mind.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.680
And so what does second mind do?

04:33.680 --> 04:41.280
So basically we're looking to solve the time that you're spending on search.

04:41.280 --> 04:47.600
And basically we sort of accept the fact that we have to find information, and we do have

04:47.600 --> 04:50.240
search engines now, and we accept that's great.

04:50.240 --> 04:55.040
But the fact is we're now spending about two and a half hours out of our day on average

04:55.040 --> 04:56.040
searching for information.

04:56.040 --> 04:57.040
That's 30%.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.040
Okay.

04:58.040 --> 05:01.040
If I told you you're stuck in traffic for two and a half hours a day, you're like, okay,

05:01.040 --> 05:02.040
I have to fix my life.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.040
But this is what we're doing.

05:03.040 --> 05:07.960
This is in 2016, the type of data, so it's not like this is getting worse, the problem.

05:07.960 --> 05:13.040
I mean, just as you say that, I reject that notion, but it sounds about right.

05:13.040 --> 05:14.040
Yeah.

05:14.040 --> 05:17.960
I mean, you have to think of it as simple as saying, are you available for lunch next

05:17.960 --> 05:18.960
week?

05:18.960 --> 05:20.280
You're searching for your calendar.

05:20.280 --> 05:21.800
Where should we go for lunch?

05:21.800 --> 05:24.360
You're searching for restaurants or whatever it may be.

05:24.360 --> 05:30.160
It could be for information like from your CRM or for if you're in the trading world for

05:30.160 --> 05:31.160
market data.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.480
So you're constantly looking for information.

05:33.480 --> 05:36.520
And the fact is we also don't know what we don't know.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.560
So that problem takes time.

05:38.560 --> 05:44.160
So that whole situation creates this situation where we're constantly looking and searching

05:44.160 --> 05:47.600
for data, people are overwhelmed in that thing.

05:47.600 --> 05:50.680
And we've heard this information overload, but this is actually a slightly different

05:50.680 --> 05:55.040
thing where yes, we have so much data in so many different places and to manage it and

05:55.040 --> 05:56.040
so forth.

05:56.040 --> 05:58.520
We have search engines, but that's still not working.

05:58.520 --> 06:03.360
So what we're looking to do is say, hey, can we solve that problem specific to conversations?

06:03.360 --> 06:04.360
Okay.

06:04.360 --> 06:09.600
The fact is the impetus for many of our searches are driven by a conversation, just as I gave

06:09.600 --> 06:10.920
examples for.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.760
So clients are saying, can you have that information?

06:12.760 --> 06:17.560
And the fact is when you're on a call or an in-person conversation like we are now and

06:17.560 --> 06:22.280
someone asked for that, you're either having the multi-task, which is obviously stressful,

06:22.280 --> 06:24.600
or you're saying I have to get back to you later on that.

06:24.600 --> 06:28.280
And what's worse when you have a client here to say I have to get back to you, someone

06:28.280 --> 06:30.400
else is going to close that business.

06:30.400 --> 06:36.080
So from a business standpoint, this is a very costly problem because they're spending,

06:36.080 --> 06:42.480
not only the money to employees, it works out from an $80,000 every side, about $14,000

06:42.480 --> 06:44.800
annually that's just gone and wasted.

06:44.800 --> 06:47.400
And on top of that, you're using those two hours a day of searching?

06:47.400 --> 06:48.400
Exactly, that type.

06:48.400 --> 06:52.920
And then you're also losing the opportunity cost in terms of the revenue of not closing

06:52.920 --> 06:55.240
the clients when you have that information, right?

06:55.240 --> 06:59.080
So that's the problem we're looking to solve and so what we basically have developed is

06:59.080 --> 07:01.080
you can think of this matching engine.

07:01.080 --> 07:04.760
I'm sort of using a Wall Street prerogative here, but basically, you can think of like

07:04.760 --> 07:09.840
it for it because an exchange would do for stocks, matching buyers and sellers, what we're

07:09.840 --> 07:16.000
doing is identifying the events in a conversation and mapping it to any data, whether it's internal

07:16.000 --> 07:19.440
or external, and pushing it to people in real time.

07:19.440 --> 07:24.480
And so that can be information from your CRM, from your market data, from say a Bloomberg

07:24.480 --> 07:28.640
or Reuters, it can be from your email or files.

07:28.640 --> 07:32.400
But someone says, you know, as you get that file, I said, it shows up right away.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.480
You know, you don't have to sit there and fidget.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.320
This is a typing part takes time.

07:36.320 --> 07:37.320
Right.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.320
So that's sort of the thing.

07:38.320 --> 07:40.560
And the way you can think of the product, it's sort of like, you can think of like a

07:40.560 --> 07:45.640
slack for conversation or the glue to provide all those applications that people can

07:45.640 --> 07:51.080
developers and companies can tie in and it's as a feed as you're speaking.

07:51.080 --> 07:56.800
And you're using conversation and speaking as the way you describe these interactions,

07:56.800 --> 08:02.400
but then you reference slack, is it primarily for textual communications or are we literally

08:02.400 --> 08:03.400
talking about speaking?

08:03.400 --> 08:04.400
Yeah.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.880
So our focus is around voice competition.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.400
That's sort of where RIP is.

08:07.400 --> 08:08.400
Sorry.

08:08.400 --> 08:12.440
And we can do regular conversation, text and chat conversations as well.

08:12.440 --> 08:16.880
Will we see the real opportunity and the unique differentiations around voice conversations?

08:16.880 --> 08:17.880
Yeah.

08:17.880 --> 08:22.880
I mean, when I think of the, you know, the way we've envisioned some of these interactions

08:22.880 --> 08:29.240
like from a sci-fi perspective and kind of this notion of the augmented human, right?

08:29.240 --> 08:33.640
Like it's like you want something that's kind of passively listening to all these interactions

08:33.640 --> 08:39.160
that you are having and then just making you smarter by popping that email up or, oh,

08:39.160 --> 08:42.920
you just mentioned lunch, you know, here with three places that, you know, fit the profile

08:42.920 --> 08:47.840
of the kind of place you like to go to without having to pull out the phone and the keyboard

08:47.840 --> 08:49.320
and all that kind of stuff.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.320
Exactly.

08:50.320 --> 08:54.960
It's a big vision we have, it's around the AR side and you sort of where people can be

08:54.960 --> 08:58.480
effectively Jarvis and Iron Man where you can show that.

08:58.480 --> 09:02.680
And so, I mean, that's not that far afresh from our standpoint because it's just a screen

09:02.680 --> 09:03.680
from our standpoint.

09:03.680 --> 09:08.280
We can display that information on any screen and basically it's just what we're providing

09:08.280 --> 09:12.640
is a low latency matching system to provide that data and any screen so that it can be

09:12.640 --> 09:15.640
that phone, your mobile phone, it can be on the desktop.

09:15.640 --> 09:19.040
If we can connect with the enterprise voice, it can be a video calls or it can be in an

09:19.040 --> 09:20.040
AR.

09:20.040 --> 09:26.640
And so, do you end up taking a position on kind of the pervasive listening aspect of

09:26.640 --> 09:27.640
that or?

09:27.640 --> 09:28.640
That's a great question.

09:28.640 --> 09:34.720
So, one of the unique IP aspects of our product is that we don't need to record conversations

09:34.720 --> 09:35.840
optionally we can.

09:35.840 --> 09:42.880
So, a lot of the companies that sort of are in the voice type space are recording data.

09:42.880 --> 09:47.080
What we've really, again, goes back to sort of my background with sort of like in line

09:47.080 --> 09:51.560
streaming of this data, throw it a process and throw it away, in fact, we are core data

09:51.560 --> 09:55.040
that we're capturing as a metadata of the mapping engine of the maps.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.240
That's where we're really focused on.

09:57.240 --> 10:02.600
So, we basically are looking to process in line, everything's in memory, we're not, you

10:02.600 --> 10:05.320
know, that's sort of, so, you know, where a lot of the companies are saying, hey, we're

10:05.320 --> 10:09.840
building on this unique part of the components and so forth, where our unique things that we're

10:09.840 --> 10:15.240
doing is focused on the real time low latency on the front end, not on the training side

10:15.240 --> 10:19.320
so much, but on the front end where very few companies are basically, we have, like, you

10:19.320 --> 10:22.800
can think of it like, again, the best way to think of is like a high-frequency training

10:22.800 --> 10:28.160
system or like what you see on Wall Street where you're processing trades very, very fast

10:28.160 --> 10:32.320
and we're looking at cashing that data very fast and processing and mapping it very fast

10:32.320 --> 10:33.320
to that conversation.

10:33.320 --> 10:39.200
So, that's really where the unique sauce comes in and so we don't need to record the

10:39.200 --> 10:44.880
conversation and start analyzing it, capturing the events and we will store the events so

10:44.880 --> 10:48.600
that could be like data that could be saved in the CRM or so forth or summering, but

10:48.600 --> 10:51.480
it's not necessarily the actual conversation.

10:51.480 --> 10:52.480
Okay.

10:52.480 --> 11:00.640
So, I get that you're not required to record the data in order to do the things that

11:00.640 --> 11:05.360
you're trying to do, but a lot of companies, you know, aren't recording data because they

11:05.360 --> 11:10.120
need to to deliver their service to recording the data because they use it to train and

11:10.120 --> 11:12.200
make their algorithm smarter.

11:12.200 --> 11:15.800
So, you know, kind of flipping it on the other side, you know, if you're taking a hard

11:15.800 --> 11:18.280
position, it says we're not going to record any data.

11:18.280 --> 11:21.640
Do you miss an opportunity to produce better product?

11:21.640 --> 11:22.640
That way.

11:22.640 --> 11:29.280
It's not, so to make it clear, there's the recording of the audio, which we're not focused

11:29.280 --> 11:30.280
on.

11:30.280 --> 11:36.000
Where we are focused on is we are storing the metadata, which is the mapping piece that

11:36.000 --> 11:39.360
we are maintaining and that we do need to know.

11:39.360 --> 11:44.720
So, basically, for that standpoint, we can then see where our engine is getting false

11:44.720 --> 11:46.680
negatives, false positives, and so forth.

11:46.680 --> 11:51.000
So, we're seeing and we can see where we are mapping the right data or the wrong data

11:51.000 --> 11:52.000
so forth.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.880
So, that's for us, I mean, that's why, you know, using this analogy of where real-time

11:55.880 --> 11:57.720
mapping engine or matching engine.

11:57.720 --> 11:58.720
Let's use the analogy.

11:58.720 --> 12:02.680
If you go to whatever you might use for an online trading system and you go, I want

12:02.680 --> 12:07.400
to buy Apple and it gets you Google, you're not going to be happy with it, right?

12:07.400 --> 12:14.000
So, that's what we are looking to ensure we don't do that, but it's different than recording

12:14.000 --> 12:19.840
someone's conversations, storing those conversations, where a lot of the companies are focusing

12:19.840 --> 12:24.440
on analytics and storing that, which then becomes, it's actually just a legal aspect to

12:24.440 --> 12:25.440
it.

12:25.440 --> 12:29.000
You have to tell people this conversation is being recorded and monitored, that's a law

12:29.000 --> 12:30.880
across the most states.

12:30.880 --> 12:35.120
Because we are not recording or monitoring those conversations, it's just being analyzed

12:35.120 --> 12:39.000
and, you know, inline and done away effectively.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.240
We don't need to even say that in that standpoint.

12:42.240 --> 12:49.200
You take in the voice and then you are you converting that to text and then your metadata

12:49.200 --> 12:53.160
is based on a text transcription of what the person said.

12:53.160 --> 12:57.960
So, they were identifying keyword to key phrases and then when we were building, so basically

12:57.960 --> 13:00.760
our chief scientist had written some papers on this.

13:00.760 --> 13:06.240
He was most recently a professor at Institute of Budapest, where he wrote some papers around

13:06.240 --> 13:10.840
the concept of attribute variable matrices and doing it in real time.

13:10.840 --> 13:17.000
So basically the idea would be in a conversation, it's not always a linear process of finding

13:17.000 --> 13:22.240
and achieving it when an event is achieved, so when I say an event means, when an event

13:22.240 --> 13:23.240
is triggered.

13:23.240 --> 13:24.240
Okay?

13:24.240 --> 13:29.600
So, if you think about it, if I say, if I go to buy a train ticket and I say, okay, I

13:29.600 --> 13:33.840
want to buy a train ticket, okay, I can't buy the ticket yet, the person asked me, where

13:33.840 --> 13:40.080
are you going and what date, what time, now I can start maybe by the train ticket, that

13:40.080 --> 13:43.480
the trigger is now finally, it gets me how many people and so forth, right?

13:43.480 --> 13:49.600
So in the same way, we are doing the same thing where we basically set up this matrices

13:49.600 --> 13:55.600
which says, okay, let's identify from the text, we can start filling out that matrices

13:55.600 --> 13:57.360
and is there an event trigger?

13:57.360 --> 14:01.400
If one set event gets triggered, it could be one keyword, it could be a bunch of keywords

14:01.400 --> 14:02.400
that we need to hear.

14:02.400 --> 14:06.840
So for example, it could be on a trading floor, it could be how many shares traded, that

14:06.840 --> 14:12.520
you can't maybe trigger there, but if someone said, what do you think of IBM, and then

14:12.520 --> 14:17.080
said, how many shares traded, or now we know for IBM, right?

14:17.080 --> 14:21.280
Or someone says, how many shares of IBM traded, we can then find that.

14:21.280 --> 14:26.880
So in that vein, we don't need to record the audio or save the text, we just need to

14:26.880 --> 14:31.760
capture the fact that someone wants to know how many shares and what stuff, and we can

14:31.760 --> 14:36.280
capture in any order, and then when it's triggered, we map it to the data that we know

14:36.280 --> 14:38.200
where to find it.

14:38.200 --> 14:45.720
So I guess the personal assistant type of use case that we discussed is kind of a clear

14:45.720 --> 14:46.720
one.

14:46.720 --> 14:52.800
Are there other use cases, or what's the initial target customer and use case that you're

14:52.800 --> 14:53.800
going after for this?

14:53.800 --> 14:59.640
So probably as I said before, there is that knowledge worker in general that we use that.

14:59.640 --> 15:04.760
We're seeing interests from the financial services vertical, financial advisors, traders,

15:04.760 --> 15:10.840
where there's a need for having that information, salespeople having to get information, close

15:10.840 --> 15:16.240
that sale, and having that data for managing that information, and so forth, obviously.

15:16.240 --> 15:21.360
But any market, maybe think about a real estate agent, someone's calling up, but they can't

15:21.360 --> 15:24.200
manage all the properties in the MLS listings, right?

15:24.200 --> 15:29.040
So someone says, what properties available in the West Village here in New York, they're

15:29.040 --> 15:30.040
not going to know.

15:30.040 --> 15:34.360
So we could push intelligently what those properties are based on some criteria that

15:34.360 --> 15:35.520
person says.

15:35.520 --> 15:38.920
You can now deliver that information intelligently.

15:38.920 --> 15:42.080
One area we're seeing, we're sort of working with a data provider and exploring these

15:42.080 --> 15:43.080
around attorneys.

15:43.080 --> 15:46.400
They're on the phone all the time, they're in conversation all the time, and they're constantly

15:46.400 --> 15:52.360
trying to get information on precedents and other legal facts that require so much search

15:52.360 --> 15:53.360
and data.

15:53.360 --> 15:56.840
So the more we can push that to the person as they're having the conversation, when now

15:56.840 --> 16:00.640
you don't have to have that asynchronous process of, let me get back to you and let's set

16:00.640 --> 16:01.640
up another call.

16:01.640 --> 16:06.880
Let me think about the time it takes to set up another call, get on the call, the process

16:06.880 --> 16:12.400
of a few minutes of talking, okay, chat, chat, chat, okay, now let's get to it.

16:12.400 --> 16:16.120
Then, oh, I don't know that answer, let me write that down, get back to you.

16:16.120 --> 16:20.920
And that constant process, we are trying to streamline that where you can now take maybe

16:20.920 --> 16:24.720
two, three, four calls and you can make it into one, maybe two.

16:24.720 --> 16:29.600
But you're basically now significantly reducing the amount of time that people need to be

16:29.600 --> 16:35.600
on those calls and searching, and you're basically making people, you know, much more efficient

16:35.600 --> 16:41.400
productive, and as you sort of said, hopefully a little, a dream of being a super intelligent

16:41.400 --> 16:43.320
or smarter than otherwise.

16:43.320 --> 16:46.320
So we've talked a little bit about the front end of this process.

16:46.320 --> 16:52.320
How are you handling the kind of knowledge, retrieval aspect of it on the back end?

16:52.320 --> 16:57.760
It strikes me that there are a number of interesting challenges there that you'd have to overcome.

16:57.760 --> 17:04.760
So the first thing we're doing is in terms of our core product, we are offering it to,

17:04.760 --> 17:09.960
you know, we're initially focused on enterprises, and we're offering that as a virtual machine.

17:09.960 --> 17:16.440
And we offer, again, this goes back to some of the IP and technology I had built in a previous

17:16.440 --> 17:21.200
companies, which is sort of like a very much of a published subscribe real-time architecture.

17:21.200 --> 17:24.440
So that's just, I'm sort of, you know, one of the things I've always loved about building

17:24.440 --> 17:30.080
companies is you sort of, you find the, the sort of the gap between two areas, and you

17:30.080 --> 17:34.320
sort of focus on there, because if you focus on, on just a machine learning and so forth,

17:34.320 --> 17:38.000
you obviously have very big players that have a lot of expertise, and you focus on, say,

17:38.000 --> 17:41.880
publish, subscribe in real-time, where you have TIPCO and IBM that are very big players

17:41.880 --> 17:42.880
in there.

17:42.880 --> 17:46.160
But you get in the gaps, you can sort of build a very exciting company that's sort of in

17:46.160 --> 17:47.160
the wedge.

17:47.160 --> 17:50.720
So we're building sort of like a wedge company that's in between those markets, which is

17:50.720 --> 17:55.240
saying, hey, we're building a published, scribe, event-based technology that's using machine

17:55.240 --> 17:58.520
learning, and a lot of the capabilities around there.

17:58.520 --> 18:04.720
And what we're doing there is to, we're leveraging what we call, like a high-performance caching

18:04.720 --> 18:11.120
engine, where companies can open data sockets from any database or technology system to

18:11.120 --> 18:17.560
our product, and we're basically have both an in-memory cache as well as a cache that

18:17.560 --> 18:21.600
could sit in storage basically that based companies would be able to access data in real

18:21.600 --> 18:24.280
time, and we'd be able to show it in the feed.

18:24.280 --> 18:27.900
So it's not a major integration process, and basically, it's just opening up a data

18:27.900 --> 18:32.080
socket to our caching engine, and then we would pull that, and a lot of that, a lot

18:32.080 --> 18:37.280
of this between this feature recognition NLP and the cache are all running in memory.

18:37.280 --> 18:43.920
So on this back inside of things, what are some of the data sources that you envision

18:43.920 --> 18:46.000
your early customers connecting to?

18:46.000 --> 18:50.880
Is there like, you know, a top three lists of, you know, their email servers or something

18:50.880 --> 18:51.880
else?

18:51.880 --> 18:56.240
Or do you expect it to be more specialized, maybe proprietary systems or databases?

18:56.240 --> 18:57.240
Yeah, great question.

18:57.240 --> 19:04.000
I mean, what we've done for building the initial prototypes, we did, you know, the Dropbox,

19:04.000 --> 19:08.400
Google Drive, Gmail, Yahoo Finance, to be able to show that.

19:08.400 --> 19:14.000
So now, right now, you can have a conversation on our product, and you know, you ask for

19:14.000 --> 19:15.720
the price of Amazon, it shows up.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.760
You ask for an email, and on X, it shows up.

19:18.760 --> 19:23.320
We're also working on exchange integration, and what we're doing is there's certain integrations

19:23.320 --> 19:28.960
where they're more broad across many enterprises, and doing a very tight, custom integration

19:28.960 --> 19:31.480
where we can find information very fast.

19:31.480 --> 19:36.080
So exchange integration gives us both enterprise emails as well as a calendar information.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.080
I mean, that's awesome.

19:37.080 --> 19:41.040
So it's just, hey, when I gave you example, when you available, boom, who was on that

19:41.040 --> 19:42.040
call?

19:42.040 --> 19:43.040
You know, who's going to be on that call?

19:43.040 --> 19:45.360
You can bring in all that information and show that person.

19:45.360 --> 19:48.600
You don't have to sit there and fidget your email, your calendars, whatever.

19:48.600 --> 19:52.720
So a lot of enterprises now are using things like box and Dropbox, so that would be a more

19:52.720 --> 19:55.440
general type of integration that we would offer.

19:55.440 --> 19:58.920
Where we see, for example, for financial services, we talk, you know, a conversation would

19:58.920 --> 20:04.120
be with routers and market data, my Bloomberg sources there, same thing with legal, like,

20:04.120 --> 20:09.440
routers, Alexa Snack is our major players, Salesforce to be an integration on the sales side.

20:09.440 --> 20:13.320
So, you know, MLS would be an integration to real estate.

20:13.320 --> 20:17.480
That's sort of the, the integrations are really not, the focus really, it gets to being,

20:17.480 --> 20:22.960
make sure to get the language, the purpose for each one, so you're not, you're getting

20:22.960 --> 20:26.680
good matches, that's the idea.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.200
And how have you tackled that challenge?

20:28.200 --> 20:32.800
So initially, we're focused on initially a couple of articles.

20:32.800 --> 20:37.640
We're not, we're not going to target the entire marketplace and we have customer interest

20:37.640 --> 20:38.640
in both side.

20:38.640 --> 20:42.080
We're actually, in the very close to releasing a enterprise version of the product here

20:42.080 --> 20:45.240
within a couple of weeks, so excited about that.

20:45.240 --> 20:49.880
And then we have, you know, these are Fortune 50 type companies that are, that are going

20:49.880 --> 20:54.600
to be demoing the product too and go from there effectively.

20:54.600 --> 21:00.840
And then in terms of, you know, the goal is to expand the capabilities to a little, you

21:00.840 --> 21:03.280
know, a little more of the cognitive side of things where we can, you know, this is

21:03.280 --> 21:06.080
sort of why we joined the, and why we use the program.

21:06.080 --> 21:10.000
And so we can work closely with some of the professors and doing some of the things

21:10.000 --> 21:14.440
around building out our APIs so we can do a little more, and not have to be so limited

21:14.440 --> 21:18.960
to building out each vertical, but you can do probably to more of a broader solution

21:18.960 --> 21:22.040
for multiple type of verticals.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.040
Okay.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.040
Cool.

21:24.040 --> 21:26.240
So what's next for the company?

21:26.240 --> 21:30.040
So, you know, as I said, you know, we're excited about releasing this product here and

21:30.040 --> 21:32.040
getting these customers teed up.

21:32.040 --> 21:36.760
It's one of these things where it's fun to show the product because it's, it's sort

21:36.760 --> 21:38.080
of magical.

21:38.080 --> 21:42.920
It's also, you want to move faster, but you have to obviously go sort of a certain course

21:42.920 --> 21:45.960
to sort of, you know, achieve those results.

21:45.960 --> 21:50.600
And basically, we're just, it's first completing this next, what we call the beta of the enterprise

21:50.600 --> 21:56.600
version, get these customers using the product and using it, and then scale from it.

21:56.600 --> 21:57.600
Great.

21:57.600 --> 21:59.080
I really appreciate you spending some time with me.

21:59.080 --> 22:03.640
It sounds like you guys are doing really interesting things, and I'm looking forward to

22:03.640 --> 22:05.640
keeping up with you as the company evolves.

22:05.640 --> 22:06.640
Thank you.

22:06.640 --> 22:07.640
I appreciate the time as well.

22:07.640 --> 22:08.640
Great.

22:08.640 --> 22:09.640
Thank you.
