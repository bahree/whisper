While I could list a ton of reasons why you should get these for yourself or your team,

9
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,360
instead I thought I'd share a few of my favorite attendee quotes.

10
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:58,120
Very, very relevant for my day-to-day work.

11
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:03,280
Total information for those trying to scale AI in their organization.

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,320

All right, everyone.

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,560
I am on the line with Aaron Ma.

22
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:46,080
Aaron is in the sixth grade and he is 11 years old.

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,760
Aaron, welcome to the Twimal AI podcast.

24
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,160
Thanks you for having me, Sam.

25
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:57,160
I really can't explain how excited I am to kind of dive into this conversation.

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:04,280
One of your many accomplishments is just the amount of dedication and accomplishment

27
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,560
you've invested in learning machine learning.

28
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:14,960
You've got three Udacity nano degrees on the topic and you've done 80 Coursera courses.

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,600
Let's just start out by having you share a little bit with us.

30
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,000
How did you initially get interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence?

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Okay.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,880
So first of all, I'm going to type out how I got started into computer science first

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
of all.

34
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,280
So when I was five, I got my first computer, which was a handy nail for my dad.

35
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,040
And it's an IMF 2008 with 2.4 gigahertz and 2 gigabytes of RAM.

36
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,040
So at first, I would be doing educational stuff like grads, kids, extramaths, Google

37
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,880
classroom, etc.

38
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:52,760
But then one day, I thought, hmm, how does this computer work?

39
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,040
Does it use images, screenshots?

40
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,040
Hmm.

41
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,080
So I decided to ask my dad and my dad said it was based on coding.

42
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,880
So I decided to learn coding.

43
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:09,280
So the first thing that I remember learned is HTFL, which is a great language for building

44
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,280
websites.

45
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,360
But then I faced a major disastrous problem.

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,400
It's because if I just use HTML, all I have is black and white.

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:25,200
And I want my users on my website to have a rich, detailed experience.

48
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,600
So I decided to learn CSS to create a rich story and make it more colorful on the website.

49
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:37,520
And then I learned JavaScript to make my websites more dynamic.

50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,560
And I'm proud to say that the first website I've ever made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

51
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:52,520
is my to-do list, which is basically a web app where you can create, delete, insert,

52
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:58,360
remove all of her to-do, and it's all stored in your browser cache.

53
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:04,120
And also around that time, my dad took me to my dad's coworker's party.

54
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:11,160
So during the party, one of my dad's coworkers brought the materials for s'mores, like

55
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,760
graham crackers, chocolates, and etc.

56
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:21,400
So I decided to make myself useful by using those s'mores materials to actually make s'mores.

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,120
So a lot of people ate s'mores because I made them.

58
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,360
Then my dad's coworker, called Jeremy, came up to me and said, you should make a website

59
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,120
if you're so interested in making s'mores.

60
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,000
I thought, hmm, I shouldn't do that because since I'm interested in you programming, and

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,560
I was a low-micky s'mores, I shouldn't make a website on it.

62
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,360
And I decided to call it the Roasting Company.

63
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,360
The Roasting Company?

64
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,200
Yep, Roasting Company.

65
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:55,280
But then when I told Jeremy that I was going to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, he was

66
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,680
like, no, no, no, you should use Angular.

67
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,240
Yes, everyone's new favorite writing framework.

68
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,040
So the first thing I did when I came home was go to plurersight.com and search Angular

69
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,040
tutorials.

70
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:18,600
And I've learned Angular from industry experts like Deborah Carrotta and John Papa.

71
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:26,360
So then I learned Angular and also the Angular router and also Angular material.

72
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,360
And also after learning Angular, my dad took me to my first Angular meetup, and I should

73
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,360
also say my first meetup.

74
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,720
So during the meetup, did I get this, how old were you when all this happened?

75
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,120
So that time I was not when I went to my first meetup, Angular meetup.

76
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:50,000
And during the meetup, there was the native script team who came in and during the middle

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,840
of the meetup, there was a native script deputy because the native script team was there.

78
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,280
So they asked for volunteers to play the native script deputy.

79
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,200
And when they asked for volunteers, literally nobody in the entire room raised their hand,

80
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,840
literally nobody.

81
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,640
So I decided to raise my hand on volunteer.

82
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,840
And three more adults came in and joined me.

83
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,240
At first, everyone was like, ha, this is such a joke.

84
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,640
But that after entering the first question correctly, which is, what is the native script

85
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:27,200
command line to a call, which I answered T and S, and also answering a few more questions

86
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,000
correctly?

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,960
Everyone in the audience was like, I knew that I could actually program.

88
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,720
So one of the people on the native script team called Sebastian Metallic was pretty impressive

89
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
to me.

90
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,520
And he asked me, do you have a Twitter, so he could follow me.

91
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,280
And I said no, because what could a nine-year-old learn Twitter from?

92
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,400
So the first thing I did when I came home from that meetup was going to Twitter and creating

93
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,400
a Twitter account.

94
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,920
And Sebastian became my first follower.

95
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,080
So if you're listening to this podcast right now, thank you, Sebastian.

96
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
Shout out.

97
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,080
What's his Twitter handle?

98
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
Do you remember?

99
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,480
I think it's Sebastian Metallic.

100
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,920
And then after a few more months of going to more angular, learning more about angular,

101
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:23,880
that's a great presentation in August of last year, when I woke up, my dad told me that

102
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,440
I should learn machine learning and AI, because it's going to be the future.

103
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,880
And I always want to be able to keep up with the future.

104
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,680
And also the second reason I wanted to learn machine learning AI was because you can

105
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,760
make mula from it.

106
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,000
So is your dad into machine learning or programming?

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,080
He's interested, he's into programming, but he's not into machine learning AI.

108
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,080
He does Friday.

109
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,080
Okay.

110
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:59,560
So the third reason that I wanted to learn machine learning and AI is because we can save lives

111
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,080
using machine learning and AI.

112
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:08,640
For example, one day, if we have a machine learning power robot that could perform surgeries

113
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:16,560
or detect cancer, people who are living in poverty can actually afford cheap medical care.

114
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,520
So basically, everyone can have access to medical care, even people who are in poverty.

115
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,360
So these are the three main reasons why I wanted to learn machine learning.

116
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,840
So that I went to youtube.com like every other kid out there and searched machine learning

117
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,560
tutorials and from machine learning tutorials online, I actually started to learn machine learning

118
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
pick up basics.

119
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,480
What was the first thing that you learned?

120
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,040
The first thing you learned was Python.

121
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,040
Okay.

122
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:52,480
So you didn't have any exposure to Python before you started studying machine learning?

123
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Yes.

124
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,120
So then from there, after learning Python, I started to learn the types of machine learning,

125
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,040
the fields of machine learning, and also tenser flow.

126
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:10,000
And I chose central because it's backed by Google, it's open source and free, and it has

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,760
a large environment community, it's in demand, it's also easy to use, compatibility across

128
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:24,040
so much platforms, there's also tenser board and also has integrations, auto differentiation

129
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,040
and is even better than PyTorch for research to production.

130
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:34,000
So after learning TensorFlow, I wanted to share my knowledge of TensorFlow.

131
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,560
To the front-end community, because at that time that's all in the front-end community.

132
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:47,800
So the problem is that most of the people in the front-end community only knows JavaScript

133
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,480
and they don't know Python, so if they don't know Python, how do they know TensorFlow?

134
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,280
So I needed a way to get TensorFlow for JavaScript, first I was like, oh no, I'm going to have

135
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,880
to create my own npm page, and I'm going to have to maintain it, etc. But then luckily

136
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:13,240
I Google TensorFlow for JavaScript, in which I got the result of TensorFlow.js, and I was

137
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,600
pretty lucky because they just released it about a year ago during that time.

138
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,320
So I was pretty lucky on searching that one, and since I already know TensorFlow, if there

139
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,440
be no TensorFlow, when you learn TensorFlow.js, all I take you is about 30 minutes to learn.

140
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:39,440
All I have to do is learn how to install TensorFlow.js, how to call some of the core stuff in TensorFlow.js,

141
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,640
and you have to learn the differences between the syntax differences.

142
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,320
For example, in TensorFlow, you use print, the default native Python print.

143
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:58,360
When it didn't JavaScript with TensorFlow.js, you have to use TensorFlow.js as print statements,

144
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
stuff like that.

145
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,440
This maybe it paused there.

146
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,720
There's a ton in the learn between Python and TensorFlow.

147
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,600
Tell me a little bit more about that path.

148
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,260
What were some of the things that, I mean, you first have to start with simple linear

149
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,400
regressions and things like that.

150
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:19,600
What were some of the things that you learned, and how did you learn them when you were first

151
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,200
getting started with machine learning?

152
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:29,000
To be honest, most of this, I'm still a beginner in machine learning, because there's a lot

153
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,600
of math I still don't know right now.

154
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,320
Since there's such a wide array of stuff to learn.

155
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,840
So I'm always still learning more about machine learning and linear regression.

156
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:47,560
I'm still learning more about it, but in TensorFlow, and also Python, I know kind of like implement

157
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,560
it.

158
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:57,760
Basic packages, like NumPy, which is numerical, Python, numerical expressions in Python, you

159
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,920
know, other Python math libraries.

160
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,960
So in general, I'm still learning more about the math behind machine learning than always

161
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,280
learning.

162
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:18,520
So right after learning TensorFlow.js and TensorFlow in November of last year is when I started

163
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,720
to think about my Christmas presents, like every other kid, because in November of each

164
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,760
year, it's always close to the holiday season.

165
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,800
And every single kid starts thinking about their Christmas presents.

166
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:40,680
So I also think, hmm, I've got to become a self-driving car engineer, but there's no

167
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,480
place on the internet where it can learn it from.

168
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,240
I googled it and I found, yeah, Google.

169
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:55,920
So I found a Udacity self-driving car engineer management program, which is the advanced

170
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
level.

171
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,120
And there's also the self-driving car, I'm sorry, intro to self-driving cars, which is

172
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,800
the beginner slash intermediate.

173
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:13,280
So in that time, which was last year, it's November, Udacity is like $1,200 per semester

174
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:16,280
I think, yeah, around that price.

175
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,960
Although I think I'm already lowered it to around 160 per month now.

176
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:26,520
So basically during that time, it was pretty expensive and I wanted to save my family's

177
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,000
money.

178
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,000
So I decided to basically take a look at the intro to self-driving cars to see what they're

179
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,640
going to teach you.

180
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,640
So basically, so what they're going to teach you, they're going to teach you Python and

181
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,160
C++.

182
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:47,040
So since I already know Python, I decided to just learn C++ to make up for the intro to

183
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,040
self-driving cars.

184
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,560
So you can save my family's money.

185
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:58,360
So after learning C++, I enrolled into the self-driving car in your nanodegree program.

186
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,600
And two days, I think three days.

187
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,080
How many courses in that nanodegree program?

188
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,880
In a nanodegree program.

189
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,200
It's not sorted by courses.

190
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,440
It's sorted by lessons.

191
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Okay.

192
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:16,560
So in a nanodegree program, I think they have around like 16 lessons, depending on your

193
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,960
nanodegree program.

194
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
Got it.

195
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:27,400
So about three days before the start of my self-driving car engineering nanodegree program,

196
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:33,840
I received an email from the Dassy legal team saying, we're sorry, but due to your age

197
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,120
that you're under 18 years old, by law, we have to legally terminate your nanodegree

198
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
enrollment.

199
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:44,160
At first, I was really frustrated because they're like breaking my dream because I really

200
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,080
wanted to be a self-driving car engineer.

201
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:54,160
So I googled on the internet for Sebastian through his email.

202
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,760
In case people don't know, Sebastian through is the CEO and founder of Udacity at that

203
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,240
time, although he sadly loved Udacity in June of this year.

204
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,040
So after two days of searching the internet, I came across

205
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,760
Sebastian through his email and there was like over 10 emails.

206
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,200
So first of all, I'm not going to send spam to them.

207
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:20,120
So I'm not going to send it to all of his emails.

208
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,240
So I decided to just send him to his Udacity email because that's the email he most likely

209
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,840
will check every single day.

210
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,520
So if you're sending him an email, I received an email from him, which stated, start and

211
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,520
finish and you make my day.

212
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:43,000
And then Gina, who's an employee at Udacity, actually CC the Udacity legal team, which

213
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,600
meant that the legal team had to hire a lawyer to write a form stating that I gave my child

214
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,440
error permission to use Udacity services, etc, etc.

215
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,480
And so in January of this year, that's when I basically started the self-driving engineer

216
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,160
nanodegree program.

217
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:07,120
So in the first term and out of two terms, because Udacity sorts their content by terms.

218
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,960
So in the first term, I learned about perception, localization and computer vision.

219
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,840
And although I didn't make the February deadline, I made it into the March deadline, which

220
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,240
meant I could enroll to term two.

221
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:29,600
So in terms two, I actually learned functional safety, control, path planning, and also building

222
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:36,680
a real self-driving car using the robotic operating system or Ross for short.

223
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:43,400
So in June of this year, June 18, I should say, of this year, that was the last day of

224
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,040
which I was supposed to graduate on the morning of that day.

225
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:54,520
I saw that I sent emails to Udacity's graduation team, but I still didn't receive a reply.

226
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:59,120
So I decided to drive there to Udacity's headquarters.

227
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,080
So at the headquarters, basically, I told them that I already completed all of the projects,

228
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,080
all of the parts stuff.

229
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:10,760
And I already sent them three emails to the Udacity graduation team, but I didn't receive

230
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
a reply.

231
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,040
So basically, they helped me by using their email, Udacity emails, to send it to the Udacity

232
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
graduation team.

233
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:25,560
And about like five minutes later, after sending that email, basically, they said, congratulations,

234
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:30,120
you graduated from Udacity, self-driving heart engineering management program.

235
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,880
And I was really excited.

236
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:40,560
During my time at the Udacity headquarters, I met the David Silver, who is the content

237
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:46,000
creator of the Udacity self-driving heart engineering management program, and also the lead

238
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,400
of the house of autonomous systems at Udacity.

239
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:56,000
I also saw Vienna Harvey, who is the owner of Udacity's own self-driving car, which they

240
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,240
call it, Carla.

241
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:05,760
And during my experience on the self-driving car, Carla, I was able to get hands on with

242
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
the car.

243
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:12,080
For example, I set up the camera, the lighters, the radars, and also running scripts on it,

244
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,040
you know, so taking a look at the lighters stuff.

245
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:20,920
And also basically checking out the code that they have written.

246
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:25,160
And to me, I think it's like a wow, and you take a look at the car.

247
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:33,400
Can you share a little bit of what you learned in the like the first semester of that nanodegree?

248
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:39,120
You mentioned that you were studying perception and localization and vision, and I know there's

249
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,760
a lot of math in those classes that you probably didn't get into.

250
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,960
But what were some of the main things that you were able to take away from the class?

251
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,960
The main things.

252
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:58,800
Well, I'd say, for example, in the computer vision part of the first semester, they taught

253
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:05,360
us about unmistoric images, which I've never heard of before, because all I knew was

254
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,640
like cameras are the best, because for example, you can see everything of cameras, but they

255
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:17,600
said no, you can't see everything of the camera, or visually, everything in cameras is already

256
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
distorted.

257
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:25,120
So you actually have to write an algorithm for unmistoric images, so they did teach us

258
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:34,240
the algorithm for understanding the images, and they taught us how to write code for it.

259
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,680
Well, actually not writing code, just teaching us how to abort the CV2 library, which already

260
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,280
handles the unmistored algorithm for us.

261
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:48,880
And for the perception part of it in the first semester, I'd say I learned about all the

262
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,480
different centers that come with perception.

263
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,640
And also what's perception?

264
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,280
Perception is basically connecting all those centers together, fusing them, which I also

265
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,280
learned how to fuse all of that data together.

266
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:12,120
For localization, I learned how to basically what localization is.

267
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:19,040
They taught us that localization is basically comparing the objects around the car, using

268
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,800
a lighter, with the objects in high-definition map, and you have to use localization for

269
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:33,360
self-during cars, because high-definition maps has about 10 centimeters or more of errors.

270
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,680
And when you're building a self-during car, you can't afford any errors, because by the

271
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,000
time that you're already fixed those errors, or you don't even fix those errors, it's

272
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
going to be too late.

273
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,720
You're probably going to collide in objects or something.

274
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,440
So you're going to have to use localization to make sure that you have one centimeter of

275
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,440
error or less.

276
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,440
So...

277
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,520
And did you learn different localization algorithms, or is there just one way to do it?

278
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:08,840
We learned about common filters, extended common filters, and also unscented common filters.

279
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:16,960
And I think my favorite would be, I'd say, the unscented common filters.

280
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Unscented?

281
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,960
Like, smell?

282
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
What?

283
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Unscented.

284
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,400
It's basically better than scented, because it's kind of, to me, I think it's more faster.

285
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,880
So because when you're developing self-during cars, you want it to be as fast as possible.

286
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,560
Because if it's going to be too slow, then you can fix a huge problem, and enough cars

287
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,320
not going to be able to respond in time.

288
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,120
So to me, I think the unscented common filters is the best.

289
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,680
And so what is the common filter doing?

290
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,240
How does that help you localize?

291
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:54,840
Well, it's basically just comparing the lidar measurements to the high definition map.

292
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,360
And if it's too far or too close, then it knows it's in the wrong place.

293
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,080
And it's going to have to reposition itself with the control, which I learned in the second

294
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,080
semester.

295
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
Got it.

296
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,480
So the first semester was all about trying to figure out where the car is, and the second

297
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:17,880
semester is all about control system, and building a real second car with Ross.

298
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,000
In the first class, when you're doing the perception and the common filtering stuff,

299
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,160
like, are you doing that in notebooks, or IDEs, or are you doing it with like actual cars

300
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,560
or simulations?

301
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,560
What were some of the things you were using?

302
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,840
So in the computer vision part, we use Jupyter notebooks.

303
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,640
It's basically like the industry standard right now.

304
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:48,320
And for the perception and also the localization, also for term two, we basically use VS Code.

305
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
Okay.

306
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,480
And so you need to bring notebooks basically switched to visuals to a code and determine

307
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,480
them.

308
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Okay.

309
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,480
Cool.

310
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,480
So tell us about the second semester.

311
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,080
So during the second semester, I learned about control and basically how to control the

312
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,560
car and the controlling part.

313
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:14,160
We actually got hands on with a simulated environment, basically control a car in the simulated

314
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,160
environment.

315
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:22,560
Although after trying multiple times my car still like jerk left to right sometimes, but

316
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,160
overall, I think it was a pretty great experience.

317
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:32,760
But after like about like 55 tries or something, I finally got it to be got it more precise.

318
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
Okay.

319
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,920
Finally, it's driving straight to the jerking left and right.

320
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:42,120
Now I was a lot older than you when I was learning about control systems.

321
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:46,400
I was in grad school and it was mostly analog stuff.

322
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:54,800
If I remember correctly, like PID controllers, is that something that came up in your class?

323
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,560
For personal integral, they're riveted, right, right, right.

324
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,680
Is that tech used in self-driving cars?

325
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,000
Sounds like yes.

326
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
It's yes.

327
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,880
Although people are now developing better control algorithms.

328
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,800
What are some of the better ones?

329
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,960
Some of them I haven't heard any of them, but I have heard that people are trying to

330
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
develop them.

331
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,960
Got it.

332
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Got it.

333
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,200
Because it's still like really hard to develop something new because right now self-driving

334
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,680
cars, it's really hard to develop because you have to be sure to safety, reliability and

335
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,360
a bunch of different factors.

336
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:34,400
You mentioned that functional safety was one of the topics.

337
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
What does that mean?

338
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:41,080
Basically, safety of your vehicle, learning about how to make your vehicle really safe and

339
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,080
also vehicle stuff.

340
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,480
For example, if you're going to build a real self-driving car, you're going to need to create

341
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:56,320
a functional safety PDF file when we learn about ISO 26262, which basically is the functional

342
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,720
safety standard autonomous vehicles.

343
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,040
How about the path planning piece?

344
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,560
The path planning.

345
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:10,800
We basically created a proportional integral derivative controller, which would drive in

346
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,560
a highway, which could drive by itself in the highway.

347
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:22,080
And for the final project, the cash sum project, which was built a real self-driving car, we

348
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,360
had to form like a team.

349
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,880
So I set up to become a team leader in like within 24 hours, like over 10 people wanted to

350
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
be in my team.

351
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:37,600
Because I had like, cut it out, five or six people, because there's a team limit.

352
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:41,000
There's a limit of how many people can be in your team.

353
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Okay.

354
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,840
So in my team, I assigned everyone to their unique role.

355
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:53,120
So I was the person who wrote the Roscoe because I'm good at Ros, and I assigned one person

356
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,680
to work on the functional safety, one person on writing the readme file on how we created

357
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,680
it.

358
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:07,760
All the person writing the readme file for the Roscoe, how we linked our Roscoe together.

359
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:14,280
So had you already been exposed to Ros prior to the course, or did you learn it in the course?

360
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:21,640
I've been exposed to Roscoe before the course even happened around February, 2018.

361
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,840
That's what I started.

362
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,320
How did you get connected to or find out about Roscoe?

363
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:35,320
I was in February of 2018, and this really crazy idea of building a robot, though it never

364
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,320
actually happened.

365
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:41,520
It was pretty sad because first of all, you need a $500,000 to build a robot, and then you

366
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,600
need to buy all these hardware components, and then you have to wire all these up, program

367
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,360
all of these, and test it, and sell it to a user for profit.

368
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,600
So you wanted to build a big robot?

369
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:56,320
Yet like a robot that could help you in your house though or something.

370
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,320
Oh, wow.

371
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:04,040
Right now, I can only test it in simulators, because it's too expensive to build a real

372
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,160
robot with hardware and stuff.

373
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,320
Have you ever built any small robots?

374
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:16,560
I've built a Arduino robot, but the problem is that I accidentally bought the wrong wheels

375
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:25,480
so it could only go forward, which was a bad choice in the making.

376
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:29,480
I think the robots are a lot more interesting if they can turn, right?

377
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,480
Right.

378
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,560
You just, if it can't turn, eventually it's just going to collide with some object.

379
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
Cool.

380
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:41,520
So you're a second semester functional safety path planning, capstone projects.

381
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,160
What was the capstone project?

382
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:48,520
The capstone project was a building, a real sell chain car.

383
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
Okay.

384
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,800
That's just what you'd ask you to call a capstone project to make it like more engaging

385
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,880
for people who want to enroll in the naming program.

386
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,880
Got it.

387
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,640
And what, this is a simulated self-driving car I'm assuming?

388
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,640
Yes.

389
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:10,600
All simulated, because if you're building a real sell chain car with rods, then you're

390
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:15,320
going to have to, like, you're going to have to buy some sort of software rods for

391
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,200
sell chain cars or something.

392
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:22,160
So you guys, he doesn't want us to like pay for like a real sell chain car stuff.

393
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:25,680
So they just basically create a simulated environment for us.

394
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,520
And so how did the capstone project turn out?

395
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
Pretty good.

396
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,520
It turned out pretty good.

397
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,640
Like we passed all of our projects, but there's only one problem that I sign up my team

398
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:46,200
up for the lottery to test our code on the real sell chain car for Carla, because you

399
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:54,400
actually has this sign up form where you can basically test your raw code on their autonomous

400
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,400
vehicle, Carla.

401
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:00,680
So they've already paid for the raw middleware for real selling cars.

402
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,680
Okay.

403
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,440
So they already put it on their car, they've already set that up.

404
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,440
So they have to just put your code on it.

405
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:12,080
But sadly, my team didn't win the lottery.

406
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
Oh, no.

407
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,880
So we never actually had a chance to test it on it.

408
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Oh, that's too bad.

409
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,760
Right now, I'm trying to build a self-driving car that doesn't use Ross.

410
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,760
Okay.

411
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,480
What will your self-driving car use?

412
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:32,240
Well, I'm planning to basically create my own sort of robotic operating system or something.

413
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,960
So I can have more flexibility on it.

414
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,760
It's going to be designed and specifically designed and tailored for self-driving cars.

415
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:48,280
So Ross is used in lots of different types of robots to your point, not specifically tailored

416
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,000
for self-driving cars.

417
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,520
What are some of the ways that your operating system will be more suited for self-driving

418
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
cars?

419
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,400
First of all, I think that I'm going to make this self-driving car operating system that

420
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:08,720
could basically fuse all the data together and also connect all of these nodes of these

421
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,320
stuff together and also make it open-source and second of all.

422
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,920
I also plan to basically have some sample code ready.

423
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:26,280
Basically, if you only know how to build a hardware car, there's already software written

424
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,280
out for you.

425
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:33,360
So all you have to do is put the software on your car, which already has the hardware,

426
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:40,160
which I think is the best way for people to get quickly their self-driving cars.

427
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,200
So you don't have to do your own software.

428
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
Very cool.

429
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,600
I get the impression that that's just one of many projects that you're probably working

430
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,920
on or thinking about.

431
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,160
Are there others?

432
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,200
There's a lot.

433
00:30:52,200 --> 00:31:00,680
In fact, right now, I'm also learning how to make a flying car, a flying car.

434
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,640
Which I don't think is going to be a reality.

435
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,480
Is there a nano-degree specialty for flying cars, too?

436
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
Yep.

437
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
The flying car nano-degree program.

438
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
Oh, really?

439
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,920
Have you started that one?

440
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
No.

441
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,640
I haven't started that one yet.

442
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:21,760
So all of these three Udacity nano-degree 80 Coursera core certificates, what are your

443
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,080
top three favorite classes?

444
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:30,720
Well, my first learning would be the self-driving car engine and nano-degree program from Udacity.

445
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,560
Okay.

446
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,760
My second pick is the AI for trading nano-degree program from Udacity.

447
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,520
AI for training?

448
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
Trading.

449
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,760
Trading for trading.

450
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,480
Oh, so that's how you're going to fund your self-driving car is through trading.

451
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,960
I'm investing stocks all day.

452
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:56,560
I'm going to have a bot that's just going to keep buying, selling stocks all day long.

453
00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:03,240
My third of all is, I would say, the deep learning AI specialization on Coursera.

454
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,240
The deep learning AI.

455
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,760
What are some of the courses in that specialization?

456
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,760
I'm sorry.

457
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,320
The deep learning AI TensorFlow specialization.

458
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,320
Ah.

459
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Okay.

460
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,320
Okay.

461
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
Okay.

462
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,320
TensorFlow specialization.

463
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,320
How many classes in that specialization?

464
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,320
There's four.

465
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,320
Four.

466
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,320
And what are they?

467
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,080
So basically, those four courses in the specialization teachers, you all about

468
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:35,960
TensorFlow 2.0, but basically, it starts off with videos of really simplified stuff about

469
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,960
TensorFlow.

470
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,560
And then there's quizzes doing enhancer learning, and they provide a Jupyter Notebook

471
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:47,400
lab environment, where they teach you the core concept of TensorFlow 2.0.

472
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:50,640
So it's basically like this for all four courses.

473
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,040
And I would say the first course is my favorite, because they're actually live interviews

474
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:05,240
from Andrew and Jean, who's the founder of Coursera, and also who's like really good

475
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,840
into TensorFlow 2.0.

476
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:13,760
So I'm pretty inspired by him on the interviews inside the first course of the specialization.

477
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,440
He is a very inspiring, very inspiring individual, like an interpreter in this field.

478
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,440
Absolutely.

479
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,480
You mentioned that you go into these courses, a lot of machine learning courses have a

480
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,640
lot of math.

481
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,640
Some of it is beyond your current ability.

482
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:37,200
How do you approach a course so that you can get something out of it, even when there's

483
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,360
potentially a lot that you don't understand?

484
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,320
What's your approach there?

485
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:49,760
Well, my approach to that would be basically, first of all, reviewing the lectures a lot,

486
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,080
first of all.

487
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:59,160
And second of all, if I don't know about the math behind it, I would try to basically learn

488
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:05,080
at least how to implement it, basically implement it using some open-source packages, because

489
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:11,720
there's always an open-source package for some sort of math for something in machine learning.

490
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,560
So I would try to learn how to implement it.

491
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,600
And basically from there on, after learning how to implement it, I would find some time

492
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:24,480
later on to basically learn the math behind it.

493
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,560
And what's an example of something that you initially, like you just couldn't get the

494
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:38,320
math behind it, you hadn't seen it before, and you took this approach, and today you

495
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,440
understand it because of that approach.

496
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:47,440
Well, I'd say about the proportional integral derivative, ID.

497
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
Okay.

498
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:54,360
And I basically learned how to implement it in C++, and learned some of the math behind

499
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,360
it.

500
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,960
Because there's still a lot of math, there's still a lot of math that I still need to learn

501
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,960
more about it.

502
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:09,320
But right now, some of it already understand, and yeah, so it's always still learning.

503
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,120
What parts do you understand now, what parts do you still not understand?

504
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:20,880
So for example, the proportional part in the integral part, I understand, the derivative,

505
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,840
I still don't know how to implement that one, and also in the math behind it.

506
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,840
Okay.

507
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:34,880
I'm always learning, I'm never sitting there like relaxing, I'm always learning, always

508
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,680
improving every single day.

509
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:45,760
And do you study math also, or what kinds of math do you study, or how do you study it?

510
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:53,960
I study math, so right now currently on math, I'm studying, trying to study linear regression

511
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,280
if I have the time from then.

512
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,280
Okay.

513
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,480
So I've found a bunch of great Yasi courses teaching on that particular subject.

514
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,480
Okay.

515
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,400
So all of this, this amazing study you're doing with machine learning, how do you balance

516
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:18,040
it with like school and chores, and all the things that I'm imagining you also have

517
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,040
to do?

518
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:26,240
Well, I balance it, because first of all, the good thing about school is that they give

519
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,480
like not a lot of homework.

520
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,480
Okay.

521
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:35,680
I can finish my homework in like five minutes, they don't give a lot of homework these

522
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,680
days.

523
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,680
Okay.

524
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,240
And for my chores, I don't have a lot of chores, for example, I have to do is take the

525
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,960
laundry, sometimes wash dishes, clean the table, sweep the floor, basically, those are

526
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
my chores.

527
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:55,560
And after completing them between school and all my chores, then I have free time to

528
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,760
basically study more of machine learning.

529
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,760
Got it.

530
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,360
And I think you also have done some Kaggle competitions, what's your experience been

531
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,360
there?

532
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,360
How many of you done?

533
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,560
So far, I've done 35 Kaggle competitions.

534
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
35, wow.

535
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:19,440
Although, sadly, I haven't won any medals on it, but I don't really care if I don't

536
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,440
earn any medal or anything, because I think it's a really great learning opportunity

537
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,440
for me.

538
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,920
Because on Kaggle, I can actually learn from my mistakes and also learn from the people

539
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,320
who actually won the competition, because after the competition, I go through the kernels

540
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,360
and actually see how they implement their way of doing that.

541
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:43,200
There's also another thing I got, although Kaggle, I learned stuff from it.

542
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,600
There's also another thing I don't like about Kaggle.

543
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:51,600
For example, in the free sound audio competition, which ended about three months ago.

544
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:57,440
So I earned number one on the public leaderboard, and just one try.

545
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,800
Although on the public leaderboard, I was like number one on the private leaderboard, I

546
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,760
was like at the end, I'm like 393 and a 408 people.

547
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,400
And you were doing the competition while it was still active?

548
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,400
Yes.

549
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,520
So I already submitted it before they merged from public to private.

550
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,520
Okay.

551
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,840
So I don't really like how they judge your competitions.

552
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,840
They only release this little bit of test data set.

553
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,440
But most of the test days that they don't release it, which I don't think is very fair.

554
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,240
Just for example, someone who has a really bad model, I'm telling them basically thinking

555
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:46,240
like go like top 100 or something on the private leaderboard, get your models like bad

556
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,960
or something, or maybe good on the unshown portion of the test data set.

557
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,720
So that's just one of the things they don't like about Kaggle.

558
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,640
But in general, I'd say Kaggle is a great learning opportunity, and I'd recommend it

559
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,640
for everyone.

560
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:09,000
Oh, and I just forgot to mention, for people who are interested in learning, which you

561
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,080
learned, but don't know where, go to Kaggle.com slash learning.

562
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,680
Kaggle.com slash learning, good resource for getting started.

563
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,680
Yep.

564
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,720
There's good resources for learning Python.

565
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:26,120
Also, there's also instructor called Alex, who's like a really good into machine learning.

566
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,800
And she has a bunch of machine learning courses on Kaggle, free of charge.

567
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,560
And also the content, I saw the content is really, really good.

568
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,800
And also some of the courses were actually made with in partnership with like grandmasters

569
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,800
on Kaggle.

570
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
Nice.

571
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,120
So what's your favorite type of machine learning?

572
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:55,600
Well, it used to be super-wise learning, but now I definitely say reinforcement learning.

573
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
Okay.

574
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,400
And why do you like reinforcement learning?

575
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,840
Well, I like reinforcement learning because you can basically do anything with it.

576
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:08,080
For example, if you're training a robot and you're using machine learning for it, you

577
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,280
don't need any data.

578
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:15,280
So you just use reinforcement learning and the robot will learn from its trial and error.

579
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,520
And after a trial and error, basically every single time is going to be like really good

580
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,920
and still going to be improving every single day.

581
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,720
So basically, you're just going to have to implement your model once and then you can sit

582
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:33,960
back and relax while you see a robot doing this task that you told it to in your machine learning

583
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,960
model.

584
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:42,280
Do you know what the hard part of reinforcement learning is?

585
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:46,280
Like figuring out what your cost function is, your optimization function.

586
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,200
Do you get into that level of detail with it?

587
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Not yet.

588
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,200
Okay.

589
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,400
It's pretty awesome that you even know what it is though.

590
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,760
Do you have a lot of friends who know what reinforcement learning is?

591
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,760
Not a lot.

592
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,360
There's not a lot of resources I'm learning reinforcement learning.

593
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:09,840
So I think for reinforcement learning, you still need to learn more about it.

594
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:13,320
There's a lot of stuff I don't know about reinforcement learning.

595
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,800
Have you done any projects with it?

596
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,880
So far, I've only done like two, I think, yet two.

597
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,480
What were the projects?

598
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,400
Which was basically finding good bananas in a simulated environment.

599
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,480
So there's good bananas and bad bananas.

600
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,480
Okay.

601
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:37,680
Your task is to train an agent to basically find the good bananas and pick that up and

602
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:45,000
put it into your basket of your good bananas and don't collect any bad bananas.

603
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,600
That's the first project.

604
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:52,520
And the second project I did was basically train an agent to play tennis, to play tennis

605
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,720
with another train agent.

606
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,400
Like pong or like real tennis or something.

607
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:02,760
Basically, real tennis in a simulated environment, of course.

608
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,240
So the simulated environment was provided by Unity.

609
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,200
So you only have to train your agent.

610
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,720
The other agent is provided by Unity.

611
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,880
So you only train one agent and there's two agents in the game.

612
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,880
So the other agent is provided by the Unity app.

613
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,360
Well, this has been such a fun conversation.

614
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,840
It's so exciting to hear about all the amazing things you've been doing, learning about machine

615
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
learning and AI.

616
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,920
Are there any other things that you want to be sure to share with us?

617
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:42,560
I was also say after my radacity network program, I was also really thrilled and honored

618
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:52,720
to be invited by Lawrence Morty at Google's TensorFlow team because I came the youngest

619
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,200
TensorFlow contributor and I basically changed the re-mean.

620
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,520
But most of the re-mean on TensorFlow's GitHub page was written by me.

621
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,720
So I tweeted it out on Twitter after I verified that.

622
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,360
It was like 300 likes and 30,000 impressions on the first thing.

623
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:15,600
So basically, Lawrence Morty, who's the developer advocate for the Google's TensorFlow

624
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:21,120
project, basically invited me to Google's TensorFlow team to basically learn the inside

625
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:27,920
and out of how they develop TensorFlow and also have a chitchat on the future of TensorFlow.

626
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:35,360
I'm also recently been really honored to be invited by Cruz to Cruz headquarters.

627
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:41,800
So in case you don't know, Cruz is basically a self-driving car company and is based in

628
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,800
San Francisco.

629
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:49,480
Yeah, I actually interviewed the head of machine learning and AI at Cruz at a conference

630
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,880
that I recently did, very, very cool guy.

631
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
You should listen to that interview.

632
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,320
In the twin AI conference?

633
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,120
That the Twomalcon conference, yep.

634
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,120
I see.

635
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:06,840
So, Cruz basically got to be a bunch of really smart engineers and talked about how they

636
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:14,880
developed their filtering cars and also about how they create their hardware and their

637
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:15,880
sensors.

638
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:16,880
Okay.

639
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,120
And overall, I think it was a really great learning opportunity for me.

640
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,120
Awesome.

641
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:26,440
You know, I forgot to, I can't believe I almost forgot to mention is you've also founded

642
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:34,320
a whole bunch of companies, Firebolt, Firebolt Space Agency, Dopey Lopey and Snap Auto.

643
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,120
What are these companies?

644
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,480
So I don't work on Dopey Lopey or Firebolt Space Agency anymore.

645
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,480
Okay.

646
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,760
So right now, I'm only focusing on Firebolt Inc and Snap Auto.

647
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:51,120
Firebolt Inc is a machine learning slash AI company that basically does machine learning

648
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,120
for humans.

649
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:56,920
So, he uses machine learning to improve human lives.

650
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:04,080
Example of one of the projects I'm working on in Firebolt is called Project Aurora, which

651
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:10,160
is scheduled to be the first beta version is scheduled to be released in around July

652
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,160
of 2022.

653
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:19,000
So, Project Aurora is basically a way of online website, which I'm developing right now,

654
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,560
but where you, it can predict cancer.

655
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,560
So, for example, if you don't know if you have skin cancer or not, take a photo of that

656
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:32,160
piece of skin that you think that might have skin cancer and upload it to Project Aurora's

657
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,160
website.

658
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:38,040
And then it can tell you if you have skin cancer or not, this is one of the things that

659
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:46,520
we're getting at Firebolt and Snap Auto is basically a company which focuses on autonomous

660
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,520
stuff.

661
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:48,520
Anything that's autonomous.

662
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:49,520
Okay.

663
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:54,480
For example, flying cars, autonomous vehicles, robotics, anything that's autonomous because

664
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,120
I love autonomous stuff.

665
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:02,560
And do you, is it kind of just you working on this or do you have a team working with

666
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,560
you on these companies?

667
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:08,020
On Snap Auto, I'm the only person because not a lot of people know self-driving cars,

668
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,520
flying cars, or robotics.

669
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,520
Okay.

670
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:11,520
Which is a problem.

671
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:12,520
Uh-huh.

672
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,520
Absolutely.

673
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:22,520
But for Firebolt, a corporation, I have a team, but I have my dad, me, and also one of

674
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,520
my friends.

675
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,520
Very cool.

676
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:25,520
Very cool.

677
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,520
Thank you.

678
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:31,320
