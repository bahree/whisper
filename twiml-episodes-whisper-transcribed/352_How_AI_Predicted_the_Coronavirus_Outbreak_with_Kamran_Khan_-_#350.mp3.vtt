Welcome to the Tumel AI Podcast. I'm your host, Sam Charrington.

00:22.160 --> 00:28.240
Alright everyone, I am on the line with Cameron Khan. Cameron is founder and CEO of Blue Dot,

00:28.240 --> 00:33.840
as well as a professor of medicine and public health at the University of Toronto.

00:33.840 --> 00:37.840
Cameron, welcome to the Tumel AI Podcast. Thanks for having me. It's great to be here.

00:38.720 --> 00:45.040
It is really, really exciting to chat with you. So you originally came on our radar as a result

00:45.040 --> 00:50.880
of a wired article that came out not too long ago about how your company Blue Dot used AI to

00:50.880 --> 00:59.280
be among the first to warn about the coronavirus. You probably have much more precise words

00:59.280 --> 01:05.200
around exactly what the role that your company is playing in that. But let's start out by having

01:05.200 --> 01:13.200
you share a little bit about your background and what brought you to apply machine learning

01:13.200 --> 01:19.040
and artificial intelligence to this problem of early identification and warning of diseases.

01:19.040 --> 01:24.240
Yeah, for sure. So maybe I'll start out by just providing a little bit of background about

01:24.240 --> 01:29.040
myself and ultimately what was the motivation for this work. So, you know, I'm a practicing

01:29.040 --> 01:34.480
infectious disease physician. I, you know, still just seeing a bunch of patients this morning with

01:34.480 --> 01:42.960
tuberculosis and managing that and I'm originally from Toronto. You know, I did my medical school

01:42.960 --> 01:48.560
training here. But I specialized in infectious diseases and public health and I was down in New

01:48.560 --> 01:57.360
York finishing up my training in 2002 and then moved back to Toronto just before the SARS outbreak

01:57.360 --> 02:05.760
happened. So Toronto, as I mentioned, is where I grew up and home. When I got here, you know,

02:05.760 --> 02:15.840
shortly after arriving, we had this outbreak of the SARS coronavirus 17 years ago and it was

02:15.840 --> 02:21.120
something that we didn't really even know what it was until it showed up in our hospitals in our

02:21.120 --> 02:27.760
city. And as a physician specialized in infectious diseases and in public health, you know,

02:27.760 --> 02:33.200
if I didn't know what this was, I don't know how anyone else would know what it was. And so it

02:33.200 --> 02:41.280
really became apparent that we need better systems to be able to detect and anticipate how infectious

02:41.280 --> 02:47.120
diseases might emerge and spread and we know that they do that really quickly. The reason why

02:47.120 --> 02:55.200
this was such a profound event for me personally was, you know, I got to see the impact of SARS on

02:55.200 --> 03:04.000
our city really in a up close and kind of personal way. One of my colleagues got infected with SARS

03:04.000 --> 03:10.960
and we had other healthcare workers who got SARS and who actually died. We had 44 deaths. We had

03:10.960 --> 03:16.320
an outbreak involving over 250 people that went on for four very long months. Oh wow.

03:17.360 --> 03:23.600
And so you can just imagine the amount of mental and emotional fatigue that sets into your

03:23.600 --> 03:28.640
healthcare workforce. When day in and day out, you're trying to confront this thing. There's a

03:28.640 --> 03:33.040
lot of personal protective equipment and gear that you got to be working and wearing in your

03:33.040 --> 03:38.880
environment. And you know, there's always the concern that, you know, would you potentially get

03:38.880 --> 03:45.680
this next? And are you going to take it back home to your family? So there was certainly an enormous

03:46.720 --> 03:52.720
amount of concern there. We saw our hospitals completely overwhelmed. They went into lockdown.

03:52.720 --> 03:58.640
All elective procedures were canceled. Our public health system was overwhelmed. And even the city

03:58.640 --> 04:04.720
took on a different feel. It was one where, you know, people stopped traveling to Toronto.

04:04.720 --> 04:10.960
So we didn't have the same kinds of people gathering. You know, there were billions in financial

04:10.960 --> 04:16.000
losses to the city. So this was a really profound event. And if we take a look at the big picture,

04:16.000 --> 04:22.160
Toronto was just one of dozens of cities around the world that were going through this outbreak,

04:22.160 --> 04:27.200
Singapore and Hong Kong and Taipei and others. In fact, these are some of the cities right now that

04:27.200 --> 04:34.640
are experiencing outbreaks of this new coronavirus. So for me, I think one of the key things

04:34.640 --> 04:39.120
really at that point was we need a better system. We need a better system to be able to detect

04:39.120 --> 04:44.560
outbreaks more quickly. We need a better system to be able to anticipate how they would spread.

04:44.560 --> 04:48.560
And we need a mechanism to be able to rapidly communicate that information.

04:48.560 --> 04:55.760
Was Toronto unique among North American cities in the impact of the SARS virus? I remember,

04:55.760 --> 05:01.200
obviously, hearing about it at the time, but it didn't feel nearly as personal. I'm based in St.

05:01.200 --> 05:06.560
Louis, but travel extensively to New York and San Francisco and other cities in the US.

05:07.120 --> 05:13.200
So there were actually dozens of imported cases of SARS into North America.

05:14.080 --> 05:19.120
It just so happened, and this is a point that maybe I'll come back to later on that in Toronto,

05:19.760 --> 05:24.240
one of the cases led to a whole bunch of other cases and triggered an outbreak.

05:24.240 --> 05:32.000
In many of the other cities, the cases were identified, quickly isolated, and there wasn't secondary

05:32.000 --> 05:37.040
transmission that went on to lead to a broader outbreak. So Vancouver had cases in Canada,

05:37.040 --> 05:42.000
and there were a bunch of US cities that had travelers who were infected with SARS, but it did

05:42.000 --> 05:51.040
not trigger an ongoing outbreak. So Toronto was one of those places where we had an outbreak that

05:51.040 --> 05:58.240
everyone heard about simply because we had case after case going on over a four-month period.

05:59.120 --> 06:08.160
And you refer to it as the SARS coronavirus. What's the relationship between SARS and

06:08.160 --> 06:13.920
coronavirus? Or maybe just define coronavirus? Is it a part of a category of viruses?

06:13.920 --> 06:21.760
So, coronavirus is there are sort of two groups. First of all, the coronavirus is largely because

06:21.760 --> 06:27.840
of the way the virus looks. It almost looks a bit like a child drawing a picture of the sun

06:28.640 --> 06:33.760
with these kind of surface proteins that go out. And there are two broad categories.

06:33.760 --> 06:39.920
Coronavirus can just cause the common cold. So these are not that unusual. But there are novel

06:39.920 --> 06:45.840
coronaviruses, new coronaviruses that may have made the leap from animals into humans. And there

06:45.840 --> 06:53.280
are two other ones prior to this. SARS back in 2003, which we think probably came from civet cats,

06:53.280 --> 06:59.120
maybe originally from bats to an intermediate animal and then over to humans. And then MERS,

06:59.120 --> 07:04.320
which is the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, that really came on the scene in 2012,

07:04.320 --> 07:11.440
has mostly been in the Middle East around, centered mostly around Saudi Arabia. And that's

07:11.440 --> 07:16.480
another coronavirus that's thought to actually originate from camels and then has spread to humans

07:16.480 --> 07:25.520
and causes severe respiratory illness as well. The animal that is the source of this new coronavirus

07:25.520 --> 07:30.720
is still being evaluated. You know, the Pangolin is one of the candidate animals that is being

07:30.720 --> 07:38.400
discussed. But genetically, this is, you know, almost 80% similar to the SARS coronavirus. So they

07:38.400 --> 07:42.560
sort of fall into the same family. You could almost think of them a bit like being cousins, if you

07:42.560 --> 07:54.400
will, related in many ways genetically. And so the virus came about via mutation, I would imagine.

07:54.400 --> 08:00.320
Is that the right term? Is that how these viruses get started? Not necessarily a mutation per se,

08:00.320 --> 08:06.400
but what happens is they have a, what we call a zoonotic spillover. And what I mean by that is,

08:06.400 --> 08:13.600
this virus is found in an animal, a human comes in contact with the virus and it just so happens

08:13.600 --> 08:21.520
that the virus is sufficiently adapted to be able to replicate in human cells and then ultimately

08:21.520 --> 08:29.840
become a human pathogen or a human disease. So that is, you know, this is similar to what we saw

08:29.840 --> 08:34.480
during the SARS coronavirus. In fact, there's a bit of deja vu with this story here, which is,

08:34.480 --> 08:43.040
if we look back to 2003, this was a pneumonia that developed in association with presumably

08:43.040 --> 08:48.480
exposure to a live animal market that then triggered that outbreak. And here we are again,

08:48.480 --> 08:56.160
17 years later, with another coronavirus associated with a live animal market that is now

08:56.160 --> 09:03.120
created the next outbreak. And this one has, you know, some similarities and some differences from

09:03.120 --> 09:10.640
SARS, but certainly is a much larger outbreak. It has now surpassed SARS, you know, many fold in

09:10.640 --> 09:17.280
terms of number of cases. And even now the total number of deaths has surpassed what we saw in 2003

09:17.280 --> 09:24.240
with the SARS outbreak. Talk a little bit about the role of early warning and the importance of

09:24.240 --> 09:30.000
or the motivation for what you're doing at Blue Dot. Let me just tell you a little bit about the

09:30.000 --> 09:35.360
the kind of evolution. So first of all, as I mentioned, I'm a practicing physician. I'm an

09:35.360 --> 09:43.680
epidemiologist by training. So after the SARS outbreak ended, you know, one of the things that

09:43.680 --> 09:48.560
first came to my mind was let's not do this again. Let's think about another way that perhaps we

09:48.560 --> 09:55.120
could better anticipate this. And I spent the next 10 years as a scientist and as a professor at the

09:55.120 --> 10:00.160
University of Toronto studying outbreaks trying to understand, are there ways that we could better

10:00.160 --> 10:06.560
anticipate how these diseases spread around the world? Now we know that ultimately these diseases

10:06.560 --> 10:12.320
that affect humans are spread by the movements of humans. And the long distant movements of people

10:12.320 --> 10:18.320
this generally occurs through commercial air travel around the world and this network, which is

10:18.880 --> 10:25.200
you know, it's not even 100 years old of commercial air travel has really transformed how people

10:25.200 --> 10:30.400
move around the world and ultimately how microbes move around the world. So I spent, you know,

10:30.400 --> 10:37.760
the next 10 years studying that and realized from various outbreaks that you actually could start

10:37.760 --> 10:44.720
to potentially anticipate how these diseases would spread. I started working with billions of

10:44.720 --> 10:52.000
anonymized passenger flight itinerary tickets and sales and those types of data. You know,

10:52.000 --> 10:59.280
it kind of dawned on me that I could learn and understand that C-164 or 16B or something was

10:59.280 --> 11:05.680
available and 16A was taken. There had to be some kind of data system that was accounting for all

11:05.680 --> 11:10.560
of these types of transactions and after studying a little bit of the information systems in the

11:10.560 --> 11:19.920
airlines, realized that there were billions of ticket sales data that actually could be utilized

11:19.920 --> 11:24.000
to understand how the whole world is connected and how people are moving around the planet.

11:24.000 --> 11:31.120
So after doing that for 10 years and realizing that there was some rhyme and reason to all of this,

11:31.120 --> 11:38.320
um, started thinking more and more about how do we move quickly? In the academic world,

11:38.640 --> 11:44.640
um, you know, when we publish in the scientific literature, it's a pretty lengthy process and it

11:44.640 --> 11:51.840
often takes months or, you know, maybe even in some cases even take years to conduct a scientific

11:51.840 --> 11:58.800
study, generate the results, submit it for peer review by the scientific community, have that

11:58.800 --> 12:04.000
reviewed if the article is rejected, do it again, if it's accepted, it goes to the editors,

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
they review it and so on and so forth. And that's a fairly lengthy process.

12:08.720 --> 12:13.840
Um, but of course, the diseases don't wait for the reviewers to review the science,

12:14.320 --> 12:20.160
they spread in hours and days. And so we needed a better system, one that was more agile to be

12:20.160 --> 12:27.520
able to respond to this. And that was for me the motivation for, uh, founding blue dot and creating

12:27.520 --> 12:34.560
this as a digital health company. Um, I will clearly say I am not a serial entrepreneur who's

12:34.560 --> 12:40.080
done this 20 times. I had never even imagined creating a company. If someone had said that to me

12:40.080 --> 12:43.760
when I was going through medical school, I would have thought I was some kind of joke,

12:43.760 --> 12:48.640
but ultimately really what I was trying to do was to solve a problem. And, uh, you know,

12:48.640 --> 12:54.000
we have a number of organizations here in Toronto, maybe similar in in in St. Louis or other parts

12:54.000 --> 13:00.080
of the United States that are really here to start supporting, um, an entrepreneurial spirit,

13:00.480 --> 13:05.360
amongst those in the university system to say, well, maybe you can take a leap of faith and maybe

13:05.360 --> 13:10.960
you can accelerate that discovery and scale the implementation of discovery, uh, using business

13:10.960 --> 13:18.320
as a vehicle to do that. So, so that was the motivation behind launching blue dot. And what I will

13:18.320 --> 13:25.280
say is that we have been for the last six and a half years building, uh, what we call a global

13:25.280 --> 13:32.880
early warning system for infectious diseases. And I'll be happy to, you know, uh, um, to kind of

13:32.880 --> 13:40.160
describe what that is and how we use data and things like machine learning and and other types of,

13:41.200 --> 13:48.160
analytical approaches and and pieces of technology to build a system that can detect outbreaks,

13:48.160 --> 13:52.640
faster than we have in the past, uh, assess how they might spread around the world and what the

13:52.640 --> 13:58.400
consequences might be and then actually generate information to disseminate it. So we're literally

13:58.400 --> 14:03.040
spreading insights and knowledge about the disease faster than the disease is spreading itself.

14:03.040 --> 14:10.320
So that's really been our overarching, uh, approach, uh, in in terms of how we have been thinking

14:10.320 --> 14:15.840
about infectious diseases, not just big outbreaks like the current coronavirus, but, you know,

14:15.840 --> 14:19.360
we're dealing with the resurgence of measles. We're dealing with, you know,

14:19.360 --> 14:24.880
Lyme disease expanding. We are, we're dealing with a world, unfortunately, a world of infectious

14:24.880 --> 14:29.920
diseases where outbreaks and these threats are becoming more frequent. The outbreaks are becoming

14:29.920 --> 14:35.520
larger and they're having larger and larger and more disruptive consequences. Let's definitely

14:35.520 --> 14:44.480
talk a little bit more about how your technology is applied to identifying and warning about the

14:44.480 --> 14:51.040
spread of these diseases. You mentioned that one of the data sets you started looking at was this

14:51.040 --> 14:58.880
airline data. I can imagine how that can tell you a lot about the spread of the disease. A lot

14:58.880 --> 15:05.840
more than it would tell you help you identify new outbreaks. Uh, so presumably there are other

15:05.840 --> 15:12.560
datasets that you're using and have access to to help with that. Absolutely. Let me break it down

15:12.560 --> 15:20.000
into kind of four chunks, if you will. The first thing is surveillance and it's picking up information

15:20.000 --> 15:25.680
about what's happening and what threats may be occurring and those threats could come from

15:25.680 --> 15:30.480
mother nature. They could come from accidents in the lab. They could come from deliberate

15:30.480 --> 15:35.760
acts of terrorism. So there are many different ways that outbreaks it can begin. So I'm going to

15:35.760 --> 15:40.480
come back and I'll take a deeper dive into surveillance and sort of detection of threats.

15:40.480 --> 15:47.520
The second piece is understanding dispersion and, you know, as I mentioned, humans are the vectors

15:47.520 --> 15:53.840
that move these diseases around the world now in these, you know, planes that fly all across

15:53.840 --> 16:00.560
the planet. We have the ability to travel in ways that are completely unprecedented across the

16:00.560 --> 16:08.160
you know, circumnavigate the entire globe in, you know, 24 hours. The third piece after dispersion

16:08.160 --> 16:15.040
is impact. What is the impact of a disease spreading from Geography A to Geography B?

16:15.040 --> 16:20.640
Does that disease, does that particular microbe of the virus? Does it have the ability to

16:20.640 --> 16:26.640
trigger a new outbreak or is it going to arrive in an area and just fizzle out and disappear?

16:26.640 --> 16:31.520
The metaphor I might use there is if you think about outbreaks and infectious disease threats

16:31.520 --> 16:39.440
is a bit like a fire. And the fires, you know, have embers flying off them and those embers might

16:39.440 --> 16:45.040
land on concrete and fizzle out and nothing happens or they might land on, you know, a pile of dry

16:45.040 --> 16:51.040
leaves and now you got the next fire going on. Outbreaks are really the same. So what we are

16:51.040 --> 16:56.480
using and I'll talk about this are using things like machine learning and AI to detect outbreaks

16:56.480 --> 17:02.560
faster. We are using other data sets on how populations move around the world, including air

17:02.560 --> 17:10.400
travel data, including, you know, in large numbers, anonymized data from hundreds of millions

17:10.400 --> 17:16.320
of mobile devices and location data around the world. We're using data from satellites, for example,

17:16.320 --> 17:21.600
as well as a whole bunch of other data in real time to understand, does this microbe in this

17:21.600 --> 17:26.640
geography at this time have the ingredients to trigger an outbreak or not? You know, I'm here in

17:26.640 --> 17:32.400
Toronto right now in February and it's about minus 20 outside their minus 20 Celsius. So I don't

17:32.400 --> 17:37.680
know what that is in Fahrenheit, but it's pretty darn cold. So if you've got a disease that's

17:37.680 --> 17:43.840
spread through a mosquito or a tick, it's not going anywhere right now. But if it was in Singapore

17:43.840 --> 17:49.440
or somewhere else, you know, maybe it's 30 Celsius there right now in humid and so forth,

17:49.440 --> 17:56.080
um, that might be the right environment at the right time for an outbreak to propagate. Got it.

17:56.080 --> 18:02.240
And the fourth piece is ultimately about communication. How do we get information into the hands of

18:02.240 --> 18:11.360
people in a way that it does not overwhelm them and is consumable and meaningful to them? So

18:11.360 --> 18:17.200
this is really important. I'll just say a couple words about it is, you know, if we keep sending

18:17.200 --> 18:23.200
everyone information about every thread in the world, you know, we we result with information

18:23.200 --> 18:28.560
overload. We just basically overwhelm people and then they just start to tune it out because it's

18:28.560 --> 18:34.640
not relevant to them. There's a professor at NYU Clay Sharkey is his name and he he sometimes talks

18:34.640 --> 18:40.800
about, um, hey, we shouldn't be talking about information overload. We should be talking about

18:40.800 --> 18:46.960
filter failure and so we often think about that. Well, what do I need to know in Toronto that's relevant

18:46.960 --> 18:54.080
to me right now? If it's relevant to someone in, uh, in Beijing, well, they should get the information

18:54.080 --> 18:58.560
that's relevant to them. I don't need to know that right now. So I'm going to talk a little bit

18:58.560 --> 19:03.600
about that, um, as we sort of go through. But why don't I start out by just describing a little

19:03.600 --> 19:09.120
bit on the surveillance side and how we gather information about, uh, outbreaks and threats?

19:09.120 --> 19:15.040
Please. So one of the things that we learned during the SARS outbreak was that if we rely on

19:15.040 --> 19:22.000
government agencies to report information about outbreaks, we may not be getting the information

19:22.000 --> 19:27.760
that we need in the most timely manner. Um, and that is even though there is a treaty called the

19:27.760 --> 19:35.360
international health regulations that countries around the world are bound to, um, they, you know,

19:35.360 --> 19:41.120
this is a treaty based on goodwill. There's no enforcement. The idea is that if countries have said,

19:41.120 --> 19:45.120
okay, if we're having an unusual outbreak, we're going to report it rapidly to the World Health

19:45.120 --> 19:50.560
Organization. Is there issue more that there's, you know, dysfunction within the information

19:50.560 --> 19:57.120
gathering and collecting or more that they, you know, are protecting their interests by not, uh,

19:57.120 --> 20:02.400
communicating about it? It could be a combination of the above and it depends in a country that has

20:02.400 --> 20:08.160
got really limited resources in a weak public health and health care system. It may be that they

20:08.160 --> 20:13.440
don't actually even know what's happening. Um, but as you can imagine in other situations,

20:13.440 --> 20:19.120
a country realizes that once it makes a statement about an outbreak that is, uh, serious,

20:19.120 --> 20:23.760
there will inevitably be serious economic consequences that follow.

20:24.400 --> 20:30.000
Um, so, you know, it gives, I can understand and appreciate that it would give, uh,

20:30.000 --> 20:35.360
some pause to, you know, reporting. And so that could lead to some delays. And when you're dealing

20:35.360 --> 20:40.080
with an outbreak and putting it out, it's just like a fire. The sooner you know about it, the,

20:40.080 --> 20:46.400
the better the chances are that you can actually extinguish it. So what we learned there was that

20:46.400 --> 20:51.840
we can't rely just on official information coming from governments. And so there has been an

20:51.840 --> 20:58.480
entire field that has developed to say, um, to, to really realize that the internet itself

20:58.480 --> 21:04.480
can be an important medium for gathering epidemic intelligence or information about outbreaks

21:04.480 --> 21:10.000
around the world. And it comes through all these different forums, um, local journalists from

21:10.000 --> 21:14.400
around the world sometimes write about things that they're witnessing or hearing in their

21:14.400 --> 21:19.920
own backyard. And it may be that that actually is published even before the government is aware of

21:19.920 --> 21:26.080
it or before the government has said anything about it. Um, there are forums that have been developed

21:26.080 --> 21:30.880
for the public health and healthcare community around the world to contribute information about

21:30.880 --> 21:35.760
things that they may be seeing, uh, in their own area. They can do so anonymously. They can provide

21:35.760 --> 21:43.760
their information. Um, but all of this information is coming in a very unstructured form. It's in text

21:43.760 --> 21:49.360
and it's in Chinese and Portuguese and Spanish and Russian and Arabic and so forth.

21:49.360 --> 21:55.920
Mm hmm. So if you basically had a human review this, well, first of all, it wouldn't be possible.

21:55.920 --> 22:03.040
There's just the amount of information is, is massive. Um, and you'd need a team of 100 people

22:03.040 --> 22:07.600
to be reading in all these languages and kind of filtering through the, is this relevant?

22:07.600 --> 22:14.320
Does this make sense? Does it not? Um, and so one of the things that we did first, you know,

22:14.320 --> 22:21.680
at Bludon started doing, um, is building a system that can gather intelligence from all these

22:21.680 --> 22:26.960
disparate sources to gather all the information that is being reported officially by government

22:26.960 --> 22:33.360
agencies around the world, like the CDC, like the World Health Organization, but also organizations

22:33.360 --> 22:39.120
that are responsible for animal health, like the World Organization for Animal Health,

22:39.120 --> 22:45.280
Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN, because many of these diseases have their origins

22:45.280 --> 22:50.560
in animals. They start in animals and spill over into human. So, so on one hand, we're gathering

22:50.560 --> 22:57.200
all that official information, but then we have developed an engine that is looking for over 150

22:57.200 --> 23:03.520
different diseases around the world, plus syndromes like, you know, an unusual pneumonia or a

23:03.520 --> 23:10.720
hemorrhagic fever or some other undiagnosed illness. Um, and so we have built an engine that is

23:10.720 --> 23:17.680
basically looking at over 100,000 articles online every day in 65 languages looking for outbreaks

23:17.680 --> 23:24.400
with involving over 150 diseases and, and it's doing this every 15 minutes 24 hours a day.

23:24.400 --> 23:30.720
Does this mean that a disease has to be well defined, uh, in order for you to identify it?

23:30.720 --> 23:36.160
So, there's two ways we do it. One is we actually look at the name of the disease and then there are,

23:36.880 --> 23:42.400
there's the kind of microbiological name of the disease and then there's kind of the lay name of

23:42.400 --> 23:48.960
the disease, you know, and then there are, uh, sometimes syndromes where it's just somebody had a

23:48.960 --> 23:54.880
respiratory syndrome or a pneumonia of unclear origin and we'll talk about that in relation to

23:54.880 --> 24:00.480
this coronavirus. So we've, we've developed a whole taxonomy that actually is kind of mapped out

24:00.480 --> 24:06.880
what all these things are and then we basically kind of have our system scanning all these various

24:06.880 --> 24:13.600
different sources, uh, looking for those key words, um, but as you could, and, uh, and also translating

24:13.600 --> 24:19.680
that information using things like Google translate into English, but as you can imagine, uh, you know,

24:19.680 --> 24:25.200
the joke we sometimes use is, I didn't know there was a heavy metal band called anthrax until our

24:25.200 --> 24:31.200
system started kind of picking up stuff, but, but that's, that's not, you know, relevant to us.

24:31.840 --> 24:37.360
Right, the very noisy world out there. It is pun, uh, you know, partially intended, I imagine

24:37.360 --> 24:42.640
there, uh, noisy world and, and it's a signal to noise problem, right? So we've got, all right,

24:42.640 --> 24:46.960
well, we have massive haystack, uh, where do we find the needles in the haystack?

24:46.960 --> 24:54.000
And so ultimately what we've done is we've used natural language processing and machine learning,

24:54.000 --> 24:59.360
and so on one hand we've had our subject matter experts, our epidemiologists and our physicians

24:59.360 --> 25:05.440
and so forth, classifying this information manually, thousands and thousands and thousands of

25:05.440 --> 25:12.800
times, and then ultimately using machine learning and natural language processing to then start to

25:12.800 --> 25:18.480
learn and replicate human behavior around, well, look, that's about the heavy metal band anthrax.

25:18.480 --> 25:24.240
Let's put that into the category we don't need to know about it or this is about a new antibiotic

25:24.240 --> 25:29.280
or a new vaccine being developed for anthrax. Okay, that's interesting and it's about anthrax,

25:29.280 --> 25:35.120
but it's not actually about an outbreak. And then here are, you know, anthrax, uh, outbreak is

25:35.120 --> 25:40.960
happening in Mongolia at this point in time. That's important. So we've done a lot of that classification

25:40.960 --> 25:48.320
and ultimately then use machine learning and natural language processing to be able to organize

25:48.320 --> 25:54.240
and structure vast amounts of data that is not really possible for a human to do.

25:55.200 --> 26:01.520
So just to say with respect to this coronavirus outbreak, what happened on December 31st,

26:01.520 --> 26:06.320
I guess when people were perhaps thinking about their plans for, for New Year's Eve and,

26:06.320 --> 26:14.400
and, you know, welcoming a new decade, our engine picked up some articles in Chinese early

26:14.400 --> 26:20.800
morning, December 31st that talked about a pneumonia and it seemed to be associated with this

26:20.800 --> 26:28.080
market where seafood and live animals were sold in Wuhan and that there were 27 cases and it

26:28.080 --> 26:34.800
was a pneumonia without a known cause. Didn't seem to be kind of typical causes you might see

26:34.800 --> 26:41.520
for a pneumonia. And so, you know, at that moment, it had translated into English and the machine

26:41.520 --> 26:47.200
flagged this as out of these 100,000 or so articles a day generally presents us with about five

26:47.200 --> 26:56.240
things to pay attention to. And so we then, so the machine AI and this engine is not supplanting

26:56.240 --> 27:01.200
human decisions, it's augmenting human decisions. So it kind of presents it to us as the subject

27:01.200 --> 27:06.800
matter experts. And then we look at them and have a brief conversation and we said here was,

27:06.800 --> 27:12.960
okay, we don't know that this is actually going to become really big, but it has the same

27:12.960 --> 27:20.720
ingredients as what we saw during the SARS outbreak 17 years ago. Nimonia, unclear origin,

27:20.720 --> 27:26.080
seems to be associated with an animal market. We've seen this before. So let's pay attention to it.

27:26.080 --> 27:33.760
So the thing that we did ultimately next is after our team of experts looked at it and then we

27:33.760 --> 27:39.360
just make a decision, does this look plausible or is there something unusual about the story

27:39.360 --> 27:43.840
and we need to corroborate it before we go any further. So it seemed plausible to us.

27:44.720 --> 27:51.840
Once we actually put it into our overall, you know, our large repository of data,

27:51.840 --> 27:58.160
this is where GIS comes in. This is like geographic information system. So once the location of

27:58.160 --> 28:04.560
Wuhan came in, our team of geographers have developed a system that can identify the locations

28:04.560 --> 28:10.960
of nearby airports to see how far away they are, where my travelers go to, which airport would they

28:10.960 --> 28:18.160
choose. I won't bore you with all the details of the modeling there. But ultimately to say

28:18.160 --> 28:23.360
is that we can assign certain probabilities if people are going to use various airports.

28:23.360 --> 28:29.520
And then we automatically then, within a second, connect to the entire world's ticket sales data

28:30.080 --> 28:35.840
to understand how travelers are moving from that location to destinations all over the world.

28:36.640 --> 28:43.120
This analysis or this last step that you're describing isn't based on kind of historical flows,

28:43.120 --> 28:49.120
but you're looking at kind of real-time actual tickets out of Wuhan or whatever the closest airport

28:49.120 --> 28:55.520
is to other airports. So there's a combination of data that comes with flights and information

28:55.520 --> 29:01.680
on dispersion. And we kind of work with three different types of data. Number one is data

29:01.680 --> 29:08.000
on the flight schedules of the actual aircraft in advance. So if you're booking a ticket,

29:08.000 --> 29:12.960
you can book up to a year in advance. So we can see all the flight schedules that are happening.

29:12.960 --> 29:21.360
Second is the actual passenger itineraries themselves. But those data come after the passenger has

29:21.360 --> 29:25.840
traveled. And then the airline compiles it. So there is a little bit of a lag and a little bit of

29:25.840 --> 29:33.520
a delay there. And then we also work with data that's anonymized. Again, I want to underscore that.

29:33.520 --> 29:40.160
But it's about 400 million mobile devices and the locations of the mobile devices. Because we

29:40.160 --> 29:46.320
know that not everyone necessarily travels by air, but populations may move across land borders

29:46.320 --> 29:52.960
or in other ways. And so the three different types of data sets allow us to gauge and understand

29:52.960 --> 30:00.960
how populations may be moving. So in this instance, what we did was we connected to our flight and

30:00.960 --> 30:07.520
passenger flight itinerary data to see what are the typical flows of travelers from that location

30:07.520 --> 30:14.800
and that particular time of year to destinations around the world. We did that and these are also,

30:14.800 --> 30:20.240
there are about four billion tickets per year and it's all the various connection points that

30:20.240 --> 30:24.800
doesn't it's not following the aircraft. It's actually following the movements of the travelers

30:24.800 --> 30:30.720
through all of the connecting points across this network. So we did that and within a second had

30:30.720 --> 30:35.680
been able to identify all of the final destinations that received the most travelers.

30:35.680 --> 30:43.360
And then the last stage that sort of kicks in here was we once we actually have done those

30:43.360 --> 30:50.000
analyses, the places that are receiving the highest volume of travelers are ones that we push a

30:50.000 --> 30:56.240
notification to that gives them a synopsis of what has been reported and what we know about it

30:56.240 --> 31:03.040
at this point in a sense. We're just literally trying to spread the information ahead of the disease

31:03.040 --> 31:10.080
so that the health officials in those locations would have an early warning. The healthcare providers

31:10.080 --> 31:14.560
in hospitals could get an early warning and even certain businesses and we tend to work with

31:14.560 --> 31:21.040
airlines could also receive notification because again, they're an important stakeholder when it

31:21.040 --> 31:27.600
comes to various outbreaks. So that's kind of a bit of a continuum of going from early detection,

31:27.600 --> 31:34.080
human verification and assessment, connection to information on the world's air travel,

31:34.560 --> 31:40.240
identifying the destinations that are most at risk and then literally pushing the information

31:40.240 --> 31:47.040
to our clients. And we do that in three real categories. One, are government agencies that work

31:47.040 --> 31:52.480
in public health, that work in national defense, national security, and even in agriculture

31:52.480 --> 31:58.800
because many diseases, African swine fever is a good example of a disease that doesn't affect

31:58.800 --> 32:05.600
humans but can really have a huge impact on swine and can affect food security and have other

32:05.600 --> 32:10.320
economic consequences. So that's one set of clients in different branches of government.

32:11.280 --> 32:16.480
As a physician who is practicing and who gets called down to the emergency room to see patients,

32:16.480 --> 32:21.600
I know what's really important and where we don't really have a robust system today is that

32:21.600 --> 32:27.680
we need to get this intelligence not just to the public health department but to the emergency

32:27.680 --> 32:35.600
department because that's where patients go. And we assume that our physicians and nurses and

32:35.600 --> 32:42.240
other frontline healthcare workers are going to be able to recognize diseases that they may have

32:42.240 --> 32:51.040
never seen before and maybe never heard of before. But that is a very big ask. It is difficult to

32:51.040 --> 32:56.800
ask your frontline healthcare workers to be able to do that when they've never seen these diseases

32:56.800 --> 33:03.920
before. But we rely upon them to do that because we need them to do so so they can protect themselves.

33:03.920 --> 33:10.560
So they don't end up getting infected or dying in the line of work that they can better protect

33:10.560 --> 33:16.400
their patients. They can prevent outbreaks in hospitals that can paralyze the whole hospital like we

33:16.400 --> 33:22.000
saw during SARS and even they can prevent outbreaks from spilling over into the community that could

33:22.000 --> 33:27.760
cripple an entire city. So there's a lot that weighs on just like when we talked about SARS earlier,

33:28.880 --> 33:34.480
Toronto was one place where we had a big outbreak but many of the other places, the cases were

33:34.480 --> 33:41.040
quickly identified, isolated and no secondary cases actually happened in those instances.

33:41.040 --> 33:46.800
And so it's really important for us to be able to make sure that our healthcare workers have

33:46.800 --> 33:52.880
these kinds of insights. Does your system make any attempts to project forward?

33:54.400 --> 33:59.600
From today, let's say given what we know about the coronavirus, what's likely to happen

34:00.720 --> 34:07.760
over relatively longer periods of time, weeks, months, that type of thing. I imagine it's

34:07.760 --> 34:14.880
difficult to do given you have all different scenarios and interventions taking place, but yeah.

34:14.880 --> 34:20.560
Well, let me just say we're not just really focusing on detection. We're focusing on anticipation.

34:20.560 --> 34:26.960
We want to be able to help individuals and organizations anticipate what might happen next.

34:26.960 --> 34:32.160
So when I think back to the early detection of the coronavirus on December 31st,

34:32.160 --> 34:38.480
we had actually published in the scientific literature the cities that we had identified as being

34:38.480 --> 34:45.440
at greatest risk of spread of this coronavirus. So that if you actually go to the Journal of

34:45.440 --> 34:50.800
Travel Medicine, it was published on January 14th. And what we had actually identified was a lot

34:50.800 --> 34:56.080
of the cities that were the first cities to receive the coronavirus as it spread out of China.

34:56.080 --> 35:02.800
Tokyo, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei, et cetera. And that list is there

35:03.920 --> 35:08.880
to demonstrate what we had analyzed using our data. So in that case, we are looking forward

35:08.880 --> 35:16.960
in trying to project and anticipate. Today, because you highlighted that the situation is so fluid

35:16.960 --> 35:22.960
and it is so rapidly evolving and adapting day to day, you can have thousands of new cases

35:22.960 --> 35:33.600
and so this is where we have been working more with these hundreds of millions of mobile device

35:33.600 --> 35:40.560
location data that are aggregated, again, anonymized, aggregated, but enabling us to in near

35:40.560 --> 35:45.920
real time understand how populations may be moving around the world so we can better anticipate how

35:45.920 --> 35:50.560
the disease might spread. So we are doing that on an ongoing basis. But it's a bit like,

35:50.560 --> 35:56.080
you know, if you think of weather forecasting, we might get a pretty good chance of understanding

35:56.080 --> 36:01.120
what's going to happen tomorrow or the day after. But if we start talking weeks or months ahead,

36:01.120 --> 36:05.680
you know, our precision is not going to be as great because there's an enormous amount of

36:05.680 --> 36:12.160
stochasticity and randomness that happens. And so ultimately, what we really tend to do is focus

36:12.160 --> 36:19.760
on iterative short-term projections and ones that are adaptive to an evolving situation.

36:19.760 --> 36:25.520
You know, it's rapidly evolving circumstances. So we are always looking ahead and trying to

36:25.520 --> 36:32.080
identify and anticipate what some of the next moves might be because ultimately, the health community

36:32.080 --> 36:36.960
has a finite amount of resources, health and human resources. And we've got to think about where

36:36.960 --> 36:42.400
we use those resources in the way that has maximum benefit either to prevent the spread of a disease

36:42.400 --> 36:46.240
or failing that at least slow the spread of the disease down.

36:46.240 --> 36:53.040
You mentioned that anticipation is one of the things that you're trying to do. Does that

36:53.760 --> 37:00.000
include identifying outbreaks before they happen? Kind of the initial outbreaks before they happen.

37:02.240 --> 37:10.560
You know, whether it's conditions that become, you know, ripe for the transfer of a disease

37:10.560 --> 37:16.080
from an animal to humans, that kind of thing. Well, let me just say that in terms of anticipating

37:16.080 --> 37:22.240
outbreaks before they happen, there's different levels. There is the anticipating the emergence

37:22.240 --> 37:28.320
of a brand new disease that no one has ever seen before. We do not do that. There are other groups

37:29.360 --> 37:34.160
that are out there in the world cataloging viruses and nature and trying to think about,

37:34.160 --> 37:38.320
well, where might the next outbreak occur of a disease we've never seen before?

37:38.320 --> 37:43.920
That's obviously incredibly difficult work and very, very difficult to anticipate.

37:43.920 --> 37:50.160
But what we do is we do anticipate the next place that may experience an outbreak before it has.

37:50.160 --> 37:58.480
So let me just give you an example going back to 2016 and the Zika virus outbreak. You might

37:58.480 --> 38:05.040
remember that was one of the last big global public health emergencies. And what we had done back

38:05.040 --> 38:12.000
in that outbreak was working with a number of some of our academic colleagues. We had mapped out

38:12.000 --> 38:18.640
where Zika virus activity was most likely to be occurring in Brazil. And I want to explain

38:19.200 --> 38:24.800
when I say most likely, why would I say that? Well, when you have a brand new disease emerge

38:24.800 --> 38:31.840
on the scene, you don't typically have a diagnostic test for that because it's a brand new

38:31.840 --> 38:37.120
disease and you still have to develop it. So in many cases, when you're dealing with a new disease,

38:37.120 --> 38:44.800
you don't actually have the ability to understand where it is. And we see the same situation here

38:44.800 --> 38:48.480
in China. We have some understanding, but there's a lot of information we don't have.

38:49.120 --> 38:54.560
So in the case of Zika virus, we had to combine data on the mosquito that transmits Zika virus

38:54.560 --> 39:00.080
on temperature that would identify where the virus was most likely to circulate because the

39:00.080 --> 39:06.960
environment was optimal for that transmission to occur. When we did that, we looked at all the

39:06.960 --> 39:13.360
locations around those particular areas and how travelers were moving to different parts of the

39:13.360 --> 39:19.200
world. This is important because Zika virus is a disease of primates and humans, so the virus

39:19.200 --> 39:25.440
replicates in the human body in the bloodstream. And when a traveler goes to another location,

39:25.440 --> 39:31.120
they infect a mosquito and that mosquito, when the mosquito bites them, the mosquito becomes

39:31.120 --> 39:37.040
infected and the mosquito then transmits it onwards. The mosquitoes didn't fly from Brazil to Florida,

39:37.040 --> 39:42.880
for example. It was the people that did and infected the mosquitoes locally. So we had napped that

39:42.880 --> 39:48.960
out in 2016 and published that in the Lancet, which is one of the scientific journals,

39:48.960 --> 39:57.440
British scientific journal, in early 2016 and I had identified that Florida was really a place

39:57.440 --> 40:03.280
that looked like it was at high risk of experiencing an outbreak because of the large numbers of

40:03.280 --> 40:08.640
travelers coming from areas of Brazil that were most likely where Zika was circulating because

40:08.640 --> 40:13.600
it had the mosquito that transmits Zika virus because the temperature was optimal for local

40:13.600 --> 40:19.760
outbreak and we had done that six months before the outbreak actually appeared in Florida.

40:19.760 --> 40:25.120
So that's an example of being able to anticipate something before it actually happens.

40:26.000 --> 40:32.800
The last thing I'll just say about that is there are instances now where we can sometimes

40:32.800 --> 40:38.160
infer based on some of our data and analytics that outbreaks might be happening in places that

40:38.160 --> 40:45.600
haven't yet even identified them. So when we see lots of connectivity of travelers between

40:45.600 --> 40:52.160
locations where there's an outbreak occurring in one place and not in another and some of those

40:52.160 --> 40:57.360
environments are places that have weak public health systems, they're poor countries, we can

40:57.360 --> 41:03.600
sometimes identify or recognize that there's a high risk of an outbreak occurring in that location

41:03.600 --> 41:11.120
even if it's not necessarily recognized. So it helps us direct our surveillance on the ground

41:11.120 --> 41:15.280
surveillance activities to places that are at significant risk.

41:15.280 --> 41:24.080
There's some criticism of the the approach that you're taking from the perspective of

41:24.080 --> 41:30.240
you know the predictions like this are difficult and maybe you got lucky a few times and that

41:30.240 --> 41:36.240
you know it's kind of reported very broadly as AI being the solution to you know epidemics,

41:36.240 --> 41:43.040
pandemics. You know I'm wondering both if you have any general comments on those types of

41:43.040 --> 41:50.240
critiques but more specifically what are the limitations of the approaches that you're bringing to

41:50.240 --> 41:57.840
bear on these challenges? Well let me just say that you know we certainly by no means would claim

41:57.840 --> 42:04.000
that AI has you know got this problem solved it's just one of the tools in the toolbox that's all

42:04.000 --> 42:10.320
it's just another it's not the the end it's the means to it's a mechanism that we can make sense

42:10.320 --> 42:18.400
of data in ways that if we did it manually it would be incredibly labor intensive and really slow

42:18.400 --> 42:25.120
and inefficient. You know as I said when it comes to surveillance if we if we did this manually we

42:25.120 --> 42:30.640
did 100 people are more doing this around the clock. Well we have four four people and a machine

42:30.640 --> 42:36.480
that managed to do this and we're tracking not every not only you know how this COVID-19 this

42:36.480 --> 42:42.800
coronavirus outbreak is spreading but we're also mapping continuously now all these other 150

42:42.800 --> 42:48.080
different diseases around the world. So in the way humans can get distracted a machine doesn't

42:48.080 --> 42:53.200
necessarily have to be distracted. So it is a tool that can help us it doesn't it's not the

42:53.200 --> 42:58.320
solution it doesn't solve every problem. I think the other thing in terms of limitations and

42:58.320 --> 43:04.960
it is very important is that you know machine learning requires large amounts of data to then

43:04.960 --> 43:11.920
actually make sense of of this and be able to predict based on observing various outcomes over

43:11.920 --> 43:17.520
and over again it requires data that is structured appropriately so the machine can consume it and

43:17.520 --> 43:23.200
develop predictive algorithms. But when we are dealing with these types of infectious disease

43:23.200 --> 43:31.920
threats they're often isn't the data is often not there and so we have to use a combination of

43:31.920 --> 43:37.360
approaches. Again this is why I say machine learning and other kind of AI modalities are just

43:37.360 --> 43:44.400
in another tool in the toolbox. So we may have to resort to epidemiological approaches in

43:44.400 --> 43:49.600
different types of models versus machine learning models because we don't have hundreds of

43:49.600 --> 43:59.760
thousands of observations that we can then use to develop a model. So I think it is I would 100

43:59.760 --> 44:05.840
percent agree it is not the silver bullet this doesn't do everything but it is a powerful tool

44:05.840 --> 44:13.520
that allows us to derive insights from vast amounts of data and do so in ways that are far

44:13.520 --> 44:19.120
more efficient than humans can do and to allow us to do things in a scalable and timely manner.

44:19.840 --> 44:24.080
Ultimately what we have trained our system due today when it comes to surveillance and we're

44:24.080 --> 44:28.960
exploring many different other applications for machine learning but in this case what we're

44:28.960 --> 44:36.080
talking about is processing vast amounts of data that humans couldn't possibly do realistically

44:36.080 --> 44:43.040
because we have to sleep and we don't speak 100 languages and but ultimately these are I would

44:43.040 --> 44:50.400
describe them as relatively low complexity tasks but they're incredibly high volume and there's

44:50.400 --> 44:55.440
an enormous amount of them so we can just simply train a machine to replicate our judgment we don't

44:55.440 --> 45:01.200
have to give it a set of rules to tell it if this then that we can just basically classify things

45:01.200 --> 45:07.520
over and over again and ultimately have the machine kind of replicate our judgment if you will

45:07.520 --> 45:12.960
about how we classify something and and then ultimately do a whole bunch of other things eliminate

45:12.960 --> 45:18.960
duplicates tell us that these stories are speaking about the same thing you know so that we're

45:18.960 --> 45:23.120
not dealing with a hundred thousand articles we're dealing with five events so there are lots of

45:23.120 --> 45:31.920
ways that these types of tools can augment our ability to detect assess and respond to these threats.

45:31.920 --> 45:37.520
Kind of tangentially what have you learned about building an organization that depends on

45:38.480 --> 45:46.240
these two highly skilled you know skill sets the physicians and epidemiologists and the

45:47.040 --> 45:53.920
data scientists machine learning engineers and getting them to work well together and building

45:53.920 --> 46:00.240
systems that kind of capture you know what both are good at. You know it's a really really good point

46:00.240 --> 46:06.240
and I'm glad you brought it up I think it tells us a couple of things and you know we've heard this

46:06.240 --> 46:13.680
many other times but it really rings true to me that diversity is essential to tackle these

46:13.680 --> 46:19.280
kinds of complex problems and I don't necessarily mean you know ethnic diversity or gender

46:20.160 --> 46:25.360
I'm talking about more broadly diversity of mindset the diversity of skills the diversity of

46:25.360 --> 46:33.520
perspectives and even the languages that we speak and I don't mean you know in French or Spanish

46:33.520 --> 46:40.160
but you know some of our mathematicians will will speak in differential equations as they think

46:40.160 --> 46:44.720
through a problem and physicians have their own language and epidemiologists speak another

46:44.720 --> 46:51.680
language and what you need is you need to bring people like this together in one place where they

46:51.680 --> 46:57.920
can learn from one another and this doesn't happen overnight it happens over years and so you

46:57.920 --> 47:03.840
mentioned I think in our pre-call conversation that you've got even veterinarians on your team.

47:03.840 --> 47:09.680
That's correct yeah physicians who practice and specialize in infectious diseases, veterinarians,

47:09.680 --> 47:17.280
epidemiologists, ecologists that think about insects and other diseases that affect you know

47:17.280 --> 47:23.600
non-human species we have geographers, a data scientist, engineer, software developers,

47:23.600 --> 47:31.120
designers etc and so it is we are a deliberately eclectic group of people with a very diverse set

47:31.120 --> 47:37.120
of skills because we can't throw a thousand physicians into the room and solve this problem or

47:37.120 --> 47:42.960
a thousand epidemiologists or a thousand data scientists it requires that diversity of skills so

47:42.960 --> 47:50.560
that I think is something that is an important and kind of a special feature of this organization

47:50.560 --> 47:56.240
and we all operate under one roof so we are not you know working remotely through email

47:56.240 --> 48:02.480
we are literally solving problems face to face day in and day out and so six and a half years

48:02.480 --> 48:09.840
later we have really learned about each other's perspectives and have become quite good at

48:09.840 --> 48:14.640
integrating these various perspectives to tackle problems in ways that maybe have never been

48:14.640 --> 48:22.240
approached before and develop these kinds of solutions it also happens to say is enormously fun

48:22.240 --> 48:28.080
if that's the word I should use just to say just imagine you know people like hackathons

48:28.720 --> 48:34.640
we're like one big hackathon you know day in and day out constantly iterating you know

48:34.640 --> 48:40.320
we have an ecologist speaking to a data scientist to a physician to a designer one day and the next

48:40.320 --> 48:44.480
day it's a completely different mix because there's another solution or another problem has to be

48:44.480 --> 48:52.480
tackled so the amount of peer to peer learning that happens is pretty incredible but also a lot

48:52.480 --> 48:59.840
of creativity comes at the intersection of all these different disciplines that you know maybe

48:59.840 --> 49:06.000
have never been explored before awesome well Cameron thanks so much for taking the time to chat

49:06.000 --> 49:13.120
