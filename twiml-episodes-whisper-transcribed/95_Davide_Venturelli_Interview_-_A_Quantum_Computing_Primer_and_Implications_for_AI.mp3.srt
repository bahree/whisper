00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,880
people doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,200
I'm your host Sam Charrington and we are back.

4
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,280
First things first, happy new year everyone and welcome to 2018.

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:37,080
I had a great holiday but I've definitely been itching to get back to the show.

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,360
As most of you know, at the end of last year we held a listener giveaway to celebrate

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,800
hitting one of our biggest milestones to date, 1 million plays of this podcast.

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
Thanks to everyone who entered.

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,200
We sent out an email to entrance a few days ago so please be on a lookout for that.

10
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,760

11
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,920
get you your swag.

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,320
Next up, the details for our January meetup are set.

13
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:11,800
Next Tuesday, January 16th, we'll be joined by veteran Twimble guest and Microsoft researcher

14
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,600
Timnett Gebrew.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,800
Timnett joined us just a few weeks ago to discuss her recently released and much acclaimed

16
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:22,700
paper using deep learning and Google Street View to estimate the demographic makeup of

17
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,320
neighborhoods across the United States and I'm excited that she'll be joining us to

18
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,800
discuss her paper and the pipeline she used to identify 22 million cars and 50 million

19
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Google Street View images.

20
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,440
I'm anticipating a very lively discussion segment as well in which we'll be exploring

21
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,200
your AI resolutions and predictions for 2018.

22
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,880

24
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,360
Finally, a bit about today's show.

25
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,320
I'm joined by David Venturelli, Science Operations Manager and Quantum Computing Team

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,120
Lead for the Universities Space Research Association's Institute for Advanced Computer Science

27
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,800
and NASA Ames.

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:12,000
David joined me backstage at the NYU Future Labs AI Summit a while back to give me some

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,520
insight into a topic that I've been curious about for some time now, Quantum Computing.

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,360
We kick off our discussion with a review of the core ideas behind Quantum Computing including

31
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,200
what it is, how it's applied, and the ways it relates to computing as we know it today.

32
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,720
We then discuss the practical state of Quantum Computers and what their capabilities are as

33
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,320
well as the kinds of things you can do with them.

34
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,480
And of course, we explore the intersection between AI and Quantum Computing, how Quantum

35
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,080
Computing may one day accelerate machine learning and how interested listeners like you

36
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,360
can get started down the Quantum Computing Rabbit Hole.

37
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,080
And now on to the show.

38
00:02:52,080 --> 00:03:03,040
All right, everyone, I am here at the NYU Scorbal Center backstage just as we're finishing

39
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,680
up the NYU Future Labs AI Summit.

40
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,360
And I have the pleasure of being seated with David Venturelli, who's the Science Operations

41
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,200
Manager for the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science at NASA Ames.

42
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,200
David, welcome to the podcast.

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,200
Thank you.

44
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Thank you very much.

45
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,120
It's great to have you on the show.

46
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,400
And I am really looking forward to this conversation because you are doing a ton of work

47
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,520
in an area that I know very little about, but keep hearing a lot about.

48
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,360
And that is Quantum Computing.

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,160
So before we get into me peppering you with questions, why don't you just tell us a little

50
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:44,000
bit about your background and how you got into Quantum Computing yourself?

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
So I'm a physicist.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,680
I'm a theoretical physicist.

54
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,520
And I did study Quantum Mechanics like every physicist does.

55
00:03:52,520 --> 00:04:00,040
Back when I was PhD students in 2008, 2007, there was hype on inside the physics community

56
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,480
about Quantum Computing, but it's nothing but it's nothing like what we have today.

57
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,880
What I did, I did study Quantum Information Science, I did study nanotechnology.

58
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:18,880
And of course, I have seen in front of me unfolding the opportunities of actually not only validating

59
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:26,040
the theories on pen and paper, but now experimenting with real world quantum machines.

60
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,960
So I joined Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 2012 as one of the founding members.

61
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:39,200
NASA, Google and USRA, University Space Research Association, decided to create this

62
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:48,160
group to investigate the near-term impact of quantum computing for computational problems

63
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,880
of national interest.

64
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,280
And that was, you know, what I've been doing in the last five years.

65
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,320
We managed the projects, collaboration with government, academia, and with, of course,

66
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,880
the principal stakeholders, the private sectors as well, to understand, really, if in the

67
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:13,440
next five to ten years, there could be an acceleration of computing because of quantum

68
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
technologies.

69
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Great.

70
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
Great.

71
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,200
I guess the place to start is on quantum technologies and quantum computing.

72
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:26,760
Like, I imagine that it is something that many in the audience have heard of, but don't

73
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:33,400
fully understand, you know, not just what the big ideas are, but what are the foundational

74
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,480
ideas upon which it's built.

75
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,720
And I'm hoping maybe you can walk us through some of that.

76
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,720
Yes.

77
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:47,720
The idea comes from the 80s when one of the gods of physics, Richard Feynman, made the observation

78
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,640
of the conference, the casual observation that if we were able to create a computer which

79
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:03,240
worked with the laws of quantum physics, then simulating quantum systems would not be

80
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,440
very difficult, while today it's very, very difficult to do that.

81
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,040
We need supercomputers and blah, blah, blah.

82
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:17,480
So this observation changed the world because the idea of processing information with the

83
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:25,880
fundamental laws of nature as APIs, as elementary building block of the algorithms, really got

84
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:35,600
every physicist excited, some early discoveries on the fact that the mathematics of quantum

85
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,200
mechanics is fundamentally more powerful than the mathematics we employ when we process

86
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,800
information in standard digital computers, really got everyone excited.

87
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,600
Can you give us some examples of that?

88
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Yes.

89
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:57,880
People have discovered in 96 that you can search a database, an unstructured database where

90
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:04,360
basically all the information is not arranged by any sorting, normally to search such database

91
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:11,520
you do not have any smart way to do it because you just have to randomly make queries.

92
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,120
And if you're unlucky you will find what you're looking for as the last attempt of your query.

93
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,880
And that means that the problem has linear complexity meaning that if you have n items

94
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:27,920
you need n trials to get to the item you want in the worst case scenario.

95
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:33,240
Now if you had the quantum database and the ability of doing quantum queries and you exploit

96
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:40,600
all these effects of preposition, interference, entanglement, you are able to find the item

97
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:46,200
you want in a square root of the number of items.

98
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:51,240
So this means that instead of for example 100 queries you need only 10.

99
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,640
And this quadratic speed up is a very interesting phenomenon which shows by itself that quantum

100
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:04,120
computing is more powerful than classical computing because there's no way you can beat this

101
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,800
without quantum mechanics.

102
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,360
But what people is really after is exponential speed up.

103
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:18,600
So the opportunity to devise algorithmic strategies that are able to accelerate exponentially

104
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
problems.

105
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:27,680
There are some examples in cryptography in chemistry where we know how to exponentially

106
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,400
bypass the bottlenecks of computation so that problems that could be solved today in

107
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:38,800
billions of years they would be solved by a quantum computer in seconds.

108
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:46,080
Well this is not the case for a lot of things that we want to solve and we are investigating

109
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,640
and it's so difficult to investigate these algorithms without having a quantum computer

110
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:57,480
that in some sense we want to build quantum computers to understand whether it was worth

111
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,120
to build them in the first place.

112
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,600
So is it fair then to say what I took away from that is that quantum computers isn't

113
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,240
the idea of kind of going piece by piece and replacing the various components on a current

114
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,960
system board with you know quantum versions.

115
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:21,080
It's not like you know shrinking down the physics is it is a fundamental new way of thinking

116
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,040
about compute that's built around the.

117
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,200
It's a new paradigm.

118
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,600
It's not incremental improvement is really a different fundamental way to process information.

119
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:38,080
Of course quantum effects are already very well taken care of by the silicon industry in

120
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:45,080
the integrated circuitry already but today they kind of bother you because you want to

121
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,640
shrink things you want to make them more faster.

122
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:55,400
Now what we're talking about is assigning a functional role to the quantum effect and

123
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:04,400
actually assigning logical states and variables to quantum states and then very finely very

124
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:14,360
delicately orchestrate their quantum dynamics so that we do mathematical operations on our

125
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,920
logical assignments and this is a new paradigm.

126
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,440
It is operating on probability distributions which are weird because they're not over

127
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:31,120
real numbers they're over complex numbers so there are imaginary units involved and it's

128
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,480
very interesting mathematically and funny enough for the listener of this show you don't

129
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:43,120
really need to know physics to become a quantum algorithm person.

130
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:49,160
It's actually linear algebra so as long as you accept why quantum mechanics works you can

131
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:56,000
study it in an after what if you have the mathematical background you can study it fast and

132
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,560
just you don't know why it works it doesn't matter but you can start writing algorithms

133
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,320
because it's just you know matrix multiplications and things like that.

134
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:13,440
What are some of the you kind of rattled off some quantum primitives that you know upon

135
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,880
which this math and these computers are built can you kind of give us the next level of

136
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,920
detail and to you know some of the most important ones.

137
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:29,080
Of course the main paradigm which is explored today is to use binary variables so bits basically

138
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,960
but generalized in the quantum world so the idea of using quantum bits or qubits so you

139
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:42,240
do identify a physical system it could be a superconductor or it could be an atom it

140
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,720
could be an electron it could be a photon anything anything which is sufficiently small

141
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,680
cold protected from the external environment follows the laws of quantum physics even cats

142
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,920
and boxes apparently so as long as you are you're able to to find that then you you look

143
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,640
at the states of the system and then you identify what is you're called zero and what you

144
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,160
call one for example it could be more states in a quantum system yes but you choose two

145
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
of them.

146
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
Oh really?

147
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,120
You say you say okay this electron can have spin up or spin down for those that know physics

148
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,600
or this photon can have polarization in one way or in another this superconductor can

149
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:31,040
have a clockwise current or counterclockwise current and then you look at how you can act

150
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,320
on the system so similarly as you do in chemistry if the system is quantum you can manipulate

151
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,280
their state like in chemistry you can do chemistry reaction but this time you need to be very

152
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:47,600
controlled so if it is an atom you need to shine a laser if it is a circuit you need to

153
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,520
apply a magnetic field and all these kind of things and when you do that you know how

154
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:01,080
your state will change the fun fact is that it is totally true in quantum mechanics that

155
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,080
you can have a state which is not zero not one it's kind of a superposition of the

156
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:13,440
true and is represented by this abstract vector in a complex number subspace where you

157
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,280
represent zero and one at the same time now when you look at it it will be zero or it

158
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,640
will be one with some probability but if you don't look at it then it's both and you

159
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,000
can operate on it like if it is both until you look at it.

160
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,840
So the algorithm the job of the of the programmer is to figure out the way to operate on this

161
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:43,520
ensemble of qubits in such a way to orchestrate the probability at the end to be the solution

162
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:49,760
of the problem you want to solve but that's a complex job because you know if you have

163
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,440
and qubits what you are really describing is a state which has an exponential number of

164
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:02,760
degrees of freedom so and you need to to basically describe it with true to the power of

165
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:07,720
and complex numbers and there's no way you can simulate this in a machine you need a

166
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,080
quantum computer to experiment most of the time.

167
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,880
So it sounds like one of the fundamental realities of quantum computing is this chicken and egg

168
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,200
problem like how do how do we get beyond that?

169
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,960
Yes you're totally right we are getting beyond that we decided I don't know the chicken

170
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:29,760
or the egg what we decided but we decided it's worth it's worth to do it and we're starting

171
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:37,280
there are companies I IBM, Riccetti, Google, Intel, they're all building chips and they're

172
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,360
making them available to the research community and people are trying to use them in the

173
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,400
short term to learn about quantum mechanics to validate the theories that are on pen and

174
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,200
paper have been devised in the last 30 years.

175
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:57,600
So now we are we are really using quantum computers as tools for improving our knowledge of

176
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,760
quantum information processing.

177
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,760
Yeah so IBM and tell some of these companies that you've mentioned have been talking about

178
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,880
this forever like in in kind of research mode I think the thing that really caught my

179
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,080
attention recently was I think it was their build conference one of the Microsoft's recent

180
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:18,800
technical conferences there was I think it was a keynote like their main announcement

181
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,240
such in Adela came out and had some researchers and they kind of you know brought out this

182
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,480
I'm not even sure what it was it looked like a GPU to be honest they brought out this board

183
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,240
that was their first attempt at a quantum computer or something you tell me what exactly

184
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,400
that was and what's its significance.

185
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:44,120
Yeah no Microsoft as well as IBM as you said like everyone had some quantum computing

186
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:51,480
expertise since the beginning of time meaning since when the field has a name and for good

187
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,960
reasons I mean good physicists kept an eye on the idea since the beginning and and this

188
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:02,560
company is higher the very good people now what changed now is that people are confident

189
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,680
that we can achieve great results very fast great results in terms of science not not

190
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,520
necessarily an applications yet because in Microsoft for example it's interesting because

191
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:19,880
they decided to they always had a very good group on architectures and quantum operative

192
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:27,000
systems and quantum compilation methods but now they decided to expand and go experimental

193
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,480
as well their approach is long term they want to do a topological quantum computing which

194
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:42,720
is a complicated mathematical theory which is allowing this type of computer to be automatically

195
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:50,960
protected against the noise of the external world so it would be amazing if it ever works

196
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:57,440
however as far as we know nobody has ever even created a single qubit so everyone is really

197
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,480
looking at what they are thinking of doing because even the announcement of a single qubit

198
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,720
would be would be interesting.

199
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:12,800
So let me just hit pause on that so the the qubit is the fundamental unit of this computer

200
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:18,840
it's it's the bit in contemporary computing yes and we've not produced one yet no no

201
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:28,440
in the approach that Microsoft was they didn't now for to give you access so IBM as 16

202
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:35,240
qubits operational allowing researchers to use them and we'll use a 16 qubits does that

203
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:42,560
mean 16 bits just 16 is not 16 that's an array of 16 oh okay no no you you can not

204
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:50,600
even solve a Sudoku with that it's it's nothing okay Google has nine but 22 under testing

205
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:58,080
49 announced then Regeri has about eight now D wave has two thousand which is oh my

206
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:04,120
god D wave is so far ahead this is D wave is a Canadian company which kind of schooled

207
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:10,280
the world in the fact that you can't try to build a quantum computer and they did before

208
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:16,880
everyone and that's even why my group exists because Google decided to buy one of these

209
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:23,160
machines a D wave machine at one of the D wave machines yes okay and to host it at NASA

210
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:29,120
and that we operated and this analogous to you know mainframe computers where it takes

211
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:40,680
a huge black box which of 40 bits no it's a 2000 but 2000 there's a catch there so first

212
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:46,080
of all so this is a huge machine it operates with cryogenic temperature saw a 13 milli Kelvin

213
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,760
we're talking about less than the temperature of space it requires a vacuum it requires a

214
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:59,080
helium it's a compact machine but it implements one strategy of computation which is quite

215
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:06,520
unknown meaning that not so so well studied which is called quantum annealing which does not

216
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:12,440
have all the requirements of the other kind of computation but at the same time it's unclear

217
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,520
the power of it so they decided indeed to create it to to experiment and and and NASA and

218
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,320
Google and us array decided to support the project and then after this Locked Martin bought

219
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:26,920
a machine Los Alamos bought a machine so now they're doing quite well how much does one of

220
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:33,000
these machines cost? Street price is from 10 million to 15 million I don't want to

221
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,720
ask them for the latest quote I don't know but it's it's actually I want to advertise in this

222
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:47,160
show everyone can use this machine a us array has a program a collaboration program for which 20%

223
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:54,600
of the machine time can be outsourced to any researcher which is submitting a proposal it's just

224
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:04,680
the five pages proposal so the the website where to find it is www.usra.edu slash quantum

225
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:13,000
and slash RFP request for proposal but so us array quantum d wave if if you google it people can

226
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,960
find and we have about 80 people 80 80 groups 80 research groups from all all kind of universities

227
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,320
around the world which are running on the machine or they they propose some of them are running

228
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,440
some not yet but it's a very successful problem wow and is all is all of the research that's

229
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:39,720
happening on this machine about how to build more machines like it or they are people doing you

230
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:44,920
know how far we in in terms of doing things with it can we add one plus one yet with this machine

231
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:50,520
yeah now we can we can do more than that but not much more than that no you're totally right let's

232
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:58,600
say 90 percent of the really invested research is of fundamental nature we need to improve our

233
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:05,560
understanding get different mindset and figuring out how to improve these machines themselves

234
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:10,360
at the same time I say that the programming this kind of machines using this kind of machines

235
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:18,120
can often lead to new ideas in classical computing because you need to change the mindset to frame

236
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:23,880
the problem in a different way in order to be attacked by the quantum computers so very

237
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,880
there are a lot of anecdotes of you know people coming up with the quantum algorithm that is

238
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:36,360
beating every possible classical algorithm that every classical algorithm was created before

239
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,560
and then the classical guys came back say wait a second I can improve my algorithm and then

240
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,840
they improved and they baited the quantum again and so on any any examples that come about yeah

241
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:54,600
but it's very nerdy example there's a recent recent recent result on QAOA which is

242
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:04,040
baptized by us the quantum alternating operator and that algorithm okay which is shown to basically

243
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:13,000
have a particular scaling which seemed to be better to what was before known on a problem which

244
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:21,320
E3-Lin it's basically connected to satisfiability but the point is like a very specific problem it

245
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:27,640
seemed that this algorithm was was beating it and then the people and then the classical computer

246
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:34,680
scientists came back and they improved their own algorithm so this is the latest example in general

247
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,560
I mean it's it's fun quantum computing because there's so much room for improvement in our

248
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:46,040
understanding that it's really fun for instance chemistry chemistry is the only grave of quantum

249
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:52,360
computing because we can simulate molecules much faster and and people were were writing on the

250
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:59,160
back of the envelope calculations seven years ago six seven years ago on how fast the quantum

251
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:07,080
computer would solve for example the molecular ground state of interesting molecules such as

252
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:13,160
ferrodoxin I remember it's a fertilizer it's interesting and people were we're trying to

253
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:19,400
calculate it and say okay it would still take some billions of years okay it's not very interesting

254
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,160
because okay with the classical computer it's impossible we'll take trillions of years one

255
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:29,080
to be able to take billions okay it's not very very worth doing it but then you know new postdocs

256
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,440
looked at the problem and say now wait a second it's not scaling as n to the power of 11 it's

257
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,720
scaling as n to the power of nine because I can do this mathematical tricks and then new postdocs

258
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,880
and PhD students look at the problem say wait a second why don't I do this transformation before

259
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,440
and I represent the problem with Gaussian waves instead blah blah blah and then they put it down

260
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:56,120
to a few years say well it's still you know not very interesting but then in a matter of like

261
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,400
I don't know a few months other groups improved improved improved and now we're talking seconds

262
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:09,080
wow so on that particular project on a specific molecule that people investigated you know

263
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:16,600
the initial estimates based on quantum mechanics understanding were so improvable that they brought

264
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,920
that they brought down n to the power of 11 to n to the power of three and and make the things

265
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:29,880
much more tractable and so now what does that what are the requirements of implementing this algorithm

266
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:36,280
that they've designed in terms of a quantum computer does our d wave 2000 bit thing get us anywhere

267
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:44,600
near that or no so d wave as I was mentioning before they can attack only some specific algorithms

268
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:50,920
combinatorial optimization with the specific method and it's unclear what the performance of

269
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:56,760
this machine can be we are investigating them early results is that it's comparable with the

270
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:03,160
Intel chips on these small problems now we would like to investigate them on large problems so

271
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:06,920
that we really could see the difference because now we're still talking about problems you can

272
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:13,000
solve in seconds so it's not really clear the overhead how much it counts and blah blah blah but

273
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:19,720
this this is interesting for d wave because again every every machine in the release is a little

274
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:24,760
bit more powerful in the previous one also on a qualitative level they give you more knobs they

275
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:29,960
give you more physical effects to experiment so that's interesting but to run the algorithms

276
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:36,440
of for chemistry for for database search that discuss our cryptography you need the computers

277
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:43,640
such as the ones which are created by now by ibn google which right now are at this nine qubit

278
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:49,720
16 qubit stage because they're much more difficult to build because they give you much more control

279
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,680
and they're called the universal digital quantum computers as opposed to the d wave which is an

280
00:25:54,680 --> 00:26:02,600
analog quantum annealer it's a little bit different flavor so this if I could paraphrase the

281
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:09,080
architecture of the this d wave computer is limited in some way so that it can only you can only

282
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:15,320
implement these quantum annealing algorithms and that's a sounds like a smallish subset actually

283
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:20,840
we don't really know exactly we don't know what types of algorithms will be easier to build the

284
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:28,360
computers but much more limited in their algorithmical encoding to to give you an idea with 2000 qubits

285
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:34,840
we can more or less solve the problems of that you can classical problems you can encode in

286
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:40,840
50 bits roughly okay it could be 60 sometimes 100 it depends on the compilation

287
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:48,840
and is that like is that 2000 bits or the 50 bits is this the entire state of the computer like

288
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,680
including like a traditional computer has you know there's state in the CPU there are registers

289
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:01,480
there is all of these yeah so yes no different yes no it's let's say no no no no your your

290
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,960
question is on point the end to end solvers will be hybrid you know system which have a classical

291
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:16,200
co-processor quantum processor so after all you can decompose your problem pre-process it divided

292
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,400
in chunks so that the quantum computer just solves the combinatorial aspect of it and the other

293
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:27,960
does something in parallel so we're way behind in figuring out what's the best way to solve

294
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:34,680
you know a full problem we are experimenting right now on on on very specific special purpose

295
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,640
problems and in that case yes we can use only this little memory and but it's improving at every

296
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:46,280
at every stage okay so the next generation machine probably will be much better than the previous

297
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,840
one and how many bits do we need to get to on the universal side to be useful yeah

298
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,480
that's a good question so it depends on the approach for example the Microsoft approach could be

299
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,160
could be a few hundred for the Microsoft approach but they don't even have one okay

300
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:07,720
but for the the other approach is like the ones which are superconducting we likely need

301
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:13,800
almost a million oh wow almost I mean we're at nine yes I mean the scalability is there

302
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:19,000
what is more difficult is the error correction the error correction we have very good theories

303
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:25,560
but we need to get the fidelity of the operations to a certain level of precision but there's no

304
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,600
fundamental reason why we shouldn't be able to do that with good engineering you need to understand

305
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:37,640
that the quantum engineer job is a new job I mean everyone which worked on this is physicist and

306
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:47,560
physicist do not know how to you know build products yeah yeah so I mean and so now engineers

307
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:54,040
are getting are getting to this game so I believe that we will have very interesting machines soon

308
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:59,960
and there's not only the big players that are startups which come out spun off of universities

309
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:07,800
for example ion cube out of Maryland is doing an amazing job with the ion trap ion cube ion

310
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,640
cube cube ion cube okay they're they're trapping atoms with lasers and manipulating them they're

311
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:19,800
very very very good at this there's a University of Bristol group I mean in the UK which

312
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:29,080
has some stealth operation on fully photonic computers so basically a lot of lasers so I believe

313
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:35,080
in the landscape one year from now will be already different from significantly from the

314
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:41,480
landscape of today wow wow and that's fun so we haven't even gotten to AI yet like what's the

315
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:47,240
intersection between you're at the quantum AI lab what's the intersection between quantum computing

316
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,320
and AI it's a very very good question so our name is might be a little misleading we have a

317
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:59,800
is it quantum slash AI no no no like quantum AI it's quantum AI first of all AI is not only

318
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:06,360
machine learning there's a lot of methods that are considered AI since even before the

319
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:12,280
hype on machine learning took off so we do a lot of optimization it's part of the AI we do a

320
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:18,280
lot of planning and scheduling which is one of my personal work where we actually have to

321
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:25,160
take decisions of how robots operate on distant planets okay how to take the robust decisions

322
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:31,000
that's the problem that you you need to solve by model based algorithmics so so that's that's

323
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,760
why there's an AI in our name because we do pay particular attention to problems where

324
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:44,680
there's not good solution yet and we need expert artificial systems to solve them but the

325
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:52,920
intersection of quantum computing and AI is interesting even beyond what we do in the quantum

326
00:30:52,920 --> 00:31:00,520
artificial intelligence laboratory the intersection could be on a technical standpoint on machine learning

327
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:06,680
there are approaches which are being investigated this is a very new field so we're talking about

328
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:15,480
only a few years of research where you can apply some algorithms of quantum computing to gain

329
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:22,360
polynomial speed ups on certain aspects for example training the neural networks there are

330
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:31,800
approaches where you can use quantum correlations to implement quantum neural networks okay I mean

331
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,440
this requires a huge number of qubits of course but people are actually looking at this kind of

332
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:44,920
and and this quantum neural networks might be very good at learning quantum problems so again

333
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:50,440
it's a little bit to self-referential but but that's that's another approach that is being

334
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,800
investigated and I must say there's an intersection on the other point of the arrows that there's

335
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:03,320
a lot that AI can do for quantum computing okay so the payoff will come afterwards quantum

336
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:07,960
computing will pay back in 10 years or something but for now what are some of those ideas do you

337
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:15,320
think even compiling a problem into a quantum computer is a big problem and you need and you need

338
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:23,720
method optimization on steroids calibrating a quantum computer is also a pain in okay I mean

339
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:30,200
it's crazy and again laboratories are our training neural networks and they are they are

340
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:39,240
employing heavy heuristics to be able to do that so there is an opportunity on both ends to

341
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:48,360
imagine what quantum computing can do for AI and how to employ AI to enable quantum computing wow

342
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:56,600
we're getting to the end of our time but is there a kind of a canonical reference or a place

343
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:03,000
that people can start if they want to learn more about quantum AI or not quantum AI but quantum

344
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:10,920
computing yes there are a lot tutorials which have been published over over the years not like

345
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:19,240
build your own qubits no with a 3d printer really it's really not that inaccessible as it was

346
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:26,520
few years ago okay so my suggestion is to look for the reviews and the lecture notes of the most

347
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:34,440
prominent professors in the field I suggest to look at the for example John Preskyl's lecture

348
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:41,000
notes Caltech that's a good start there's another very very skilled evangelizers of quantum

349
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,840
computing is Scott Aronson he has a fantastic blog which is very followed where he discusses

350
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:54,680
a lot of aspects of quantum computing so I'm sure that if the listener to this show are motivated

351
00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:02,040
they will find their way and of course please feel free to contact me my my email is Davide David

352
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:10,120
with the near the end dot venturelli at nasa dot gov okay great well Davide thank you so much for

353
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:15,640
taking time out to chat with us I learned a ton but there is so much more to learn about this

354
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,480
I really enjoyed it thanks bye bye

357
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:40,680
on apple podcasts my producer says that one of his goals this year is to crack the top 10 and to

358
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:47,080
do that we need you to head over to your podcast app rate the show hopefully we've earned five stars
