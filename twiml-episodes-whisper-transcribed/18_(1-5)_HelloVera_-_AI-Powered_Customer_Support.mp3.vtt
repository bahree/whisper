00:00.000 --> 00:17.240
Hello and welcome to another episode of Tumel Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

00:17.240 --> 00:22.240
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:22.240 --> 00:25.820
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:25.820 --> 00:29.680
This time around, we're doing something special here on the show and I'm really excited

00:29.680 --> 00:31.620
to share it with you.

00:31.620 --> 00:36.720
My producer and I spent some time in New York City this week, guests of the fine folks

00:36.720 --> 00:43.040
from the future labs at NYU Tandon and FF Venture Capital, who are sponsors of this

00:43.040 --> 00:51.080
week's show and the organizations behind the NYU FF VC AI Nexus Lab startup accelerator

00:51.080 --> 00:53.160
program.

00:53.160 --> 00:57.960
You might recall that I mentioned the future labs AI Summit last week, an event hosted

00:57.960 --> 01:03.440
by the AI Nexus Lab to showcase the startups in their first batch, as well as the impressive

01:03.440 --> 01:06.880
AI talent in the New York City ecosystem.

01:06.880 --> 01:11.680
We attended this event on Wednesday afternoon and had an amazing time.

01:11.680 --> 01:16.520
We got to give out a bunch of Twimmel stickers, meet some fans of the show, and check out

01:16.520 --> 01:18.320
a great set of speakers.

01:18.320 --> 01:25.320
I particularly enjoyed watching AI luminaries Gary Marcus and Jan LeCoon, both NYU faculty

01:25.320 --> 01:29.400
and longtime friends, taking swipes at one another from the stage.

01:29.400 --> 01:30.720
It was great.

01:30.720 --> 01:35.080
I tweeted some of the highlights, which you can check out by looking me up on Twitter at

01:35.080 --> 01:37.960
at Sam Charrington.

01:37.960 --> 01:42.800
We had our mobile studio set up in a backstage dressing room and over the next few weeks we'll

01:42.800 --> 01:47.600
be sharing some great discussions we had with some of the speakers at the event.

01:47.600 --> 01:51.720
But first, we've got a monster of a show for you this week.

01:51.720 --> 01:56.200
Backed from the future labs incubator space, we spoke with founders from the five companies

01:56.200 --> 02:00.160
in the inaugural batch of the AI Nexus Lab program.

02:00.160 --> 02:08.080
Hello Vera, Clustera, behold.ai, Cambrian intelligence, and Alpha Vertex.

02:08.080 --> 02:12.800
These companies are doing some really interesting things and I think you'll enjoy hearing their

02:12.800 --> 02:14.280
stories.

02:14.280 --> 02:19.480
We also spent some time chatting with Steve Cuyin, the managing director of future labs,

02:19.480 --> 02:23.320
but what makes the AI Nexus Lab program so special?

02:23.320 --> 02:27.720
We're releasing all six of these interviews simultaneously for your binge listening

02:27.720 --> 02:33.240
pleasure as Twilmultalk number 18, parts one through five.

02:33.240 --> 02:37.760
Before we get started though, if you like what you hear, you might be interested to know

02:37.760 --> 02:42.760
that applications are now open for the next AI Nexus Lab cohort.

02:42.760 --> 02:49.200
The program gives companies $100,000 in investment capital, four months of customized programming

02:49.200 --> 02:54.440
plus three additional months of free space, along with curated mentorship from leading

02:54.440 --> 03:00.200
NYU academics and New York City investors, pro bono services from partners like lawyers

03:00.200 --> 03:05.520
and designers, plus a paid four student fellow for the duration of the program.

03:05.520 --> 03:11.120
Additionally, each company is partnered with an AI Nexus Lab corporate pilot partner,

03:11.120 --> 03:16.440
which in the last cohort included Daimler, Quantopia, and Tough Mudder.

03:16.440 --> 03:19.680
The application deadline for the program is coming up quickly.

03:19.680 --> 03:24.120
It's May 3rd, and the cohort starts on July 10th.

03:24.120 --> 03:32.240
For more details and to apply, visit nexuslab.ai or email hello at futurelabs.nyc with any

03:32.240 --> 03:33.800
questions.

03:33.800 --> 03:42.280
And now, on Tourship.

03:42.280 --> 03:46.520
Hello everyone, this is Sam Charrington from this week in Machine Learning and AI, and

03:46.520 --> 03:53.000
I am live here at the NYU Future Labs Accelerator Space, and I'll be talking to several of the

03:53.000 --> 03:57.200
companies from the NYU AI Nexus Accelerator.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.440
And the first up here is Hello Vera.

04:00.440 --> 04:07.120
And I'm here with James Fan and Liang Liang Zhao.

04:07.120 --> 04:13.280
Guys, why don't you say hi?

04:13.280 --> 04:16.440
So tell us a little bit about Hello Vera.

04:16.440 --> 04:17.960
Yes, Hello Vera.

04:17.960 --> 04:23.160
We are applying artificial intelligence technology to the problem of customer service.

04:23.160 --> 04:27.960
As you know, customer service is a major pain point for a lot of enterprises.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.840
It requires a lot of human agents.

04:30.840 --> 04:36.480
It's a very costly operation, often it costs $2 for a human agent to send you an email

04:36.480 --> 04:39.400
and the $5 to answer a phone call.

04:39.400 --> 04:44.640
With all the money spent, customer satisfaction actually is all the time low.

04:44.640 --> 04:49.680
So last year, I went to talk to Liang Liang and they said, you know what, this is a problem

04:49.680 --> 04:53.080
that artificial intelligence can help a lot.

04:53.080 --> 04:57.320
You know what makes human hate to do this job is this is very repetitive.

04:57.320 --> 05:03.480
If you look at the top customer service issues, they're almost always the same issues repeating

05:03.480 --> 05:05.360
over and over.

05:05.360 --> 05:11.320
So that's a perfect fit for AI because the repetitive nature makes it easy for AI to

05:11.320 --> 05:13.720
learn to recognize the patterns in it.

05:13.720 --> 05:16.920
And then there's also a lot of data in this domain.

05:16.920 --> 05:21.360
Every company keeps track of the previously solved tickets and how human agents have solved

05:21.360 --> 05:22.360
the tickets.

05:22.360 --> 05:26.000
You know, data is the lifeline of artificial intelligence, right?

05:26.000 --> 05:31.080
So this data, we can use machine learning technology to learn how to resolve it just

05:31.080 --> 05:33.000
like a human would.

05:33.000 --> 05:38.680
And what's better is, when you once you deploy, you have additional new data coming in.

05:38.680 --> 05:44.600
So the AI technology for customer service will get better and better after it gets deployed.

05:44.600 --> 05:49.000
So you're part of this accelerator now, how long have you been doing this?

05:49.000 --> 05:53.480
We started last year, so we just about a year.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.480
Okay.

05:55.480 --> 06:03.400
And there have been a number of companies going after the customer support, the customer

06:03.400 --> 06:09.800
support market, and trying to apply machine learning and AI, everything from startups to

06:09.800 --> 06:13.840
you know, big companies in a space like Zendesk and others, what is unique about your

06:13.840 --> 06:14.840
approach?

06:14.840 --> 06:15.840
Right.

06:15.840 --> 06:23.280
So if you look at the space in this, there are three type of companies.

06:23.280 --> 06:27.920
There's one type that's doing essentially a frequently asked question search type of

06:27.920 --> 06:29.720
things.

06:29.720 --> 06:32.120
You know, that has a limited capabilities.

06:32.120 --> 06:37.640
A second type is what we call agent assist, basically they provide tools to make human

06:37.640 --> 06:40.440
agents to do their job more efficiently.

06:40.440 --> 06:44.600
That's nice, but your human agent's still the bottleneck.

06:44.600 --> 06:48.680
If your human agent go home, your customers won't get their questions answered until they

06:48.680 --> 06:50.360
come back again.

06:50.360 --> 06:57.360
The third type is these chat platforms that if your company have enough technology, techies

06:57.360 --> 07:05.560
available, you can tell them to use the chat platform builders to build a chatbot.

07:05.560 --> 07:11.000
One thing is very important to know is most of these chatbots are very script based.

07:11.000 --> 07:16.920
So if you have scripts, then one thing you find out very quickly is once you deploy, customers

07:16.920 --> 07:21.200
will never behave the way you imagine they were, they don't follow the script.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.600
And then your chatbot just falls apart.

07:23.600 --> 07:27.480
So our approach is where you're taking machine learning data driven approach.

07:27.480 --> 07:33.600
So it's a lot more robust and as we have more and more data, it actually gets better

07:33.600 --> 07:34.600
and better.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.720
And our bot actually is autonomous.

07:37.720 --> 07:41.000
It gives answers in real time, instantaneously.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Okay.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.040
Can you tell me a little bit more about that?

07:45.040 --> 07:50.200
I think most people who are doing AI and machine learning would characterize it as data

07:50.200 --> 07:51.200
driven.

07:51.200 --> 07:56.560
What specifically are you doing to collect and process this data to make your bot smarter?

07:56.560 --> 07:57.560
Yes.

07:57.560 --> 08:03.840
We have come up with a proprietary machine learning algorithm based on deep learning.

08:03.840 --> 08:10.160
It's able to be a number of deep learning based approach, state or deep learning approaches,

08:10.160 --> 08:16.680
a number of natural language processing tasks, as well as a number of benchmark data sets.

08:16.680 --> 08:23.320
Our deep learning program is able to take advantage of all the data in customer service

08:23.320 --> 08:28.840
domain, even starting with a small number of data, but its performance continues to improve

08:28.840 --> 08:33.080
as the data gets more and more available.

08:33.080 --> 08:39.320
How much data does a customer typically need to have to start off with?

08:39.320 --> 08:41.240
We can start off with a very little data.

08:41.240 --> 08:51.280
We can start off with just a dozen, two dozen instances with a dozen or two dozen question

08:51.280 --> 08:52.280
answer pairs.

08:52.280 --> 08:53.600
Okay.

08:53.600 --> 08:59.760
And then we are able to start with running and produce answers.

08:59.760 --> 09:06.320
When you're, so you start with your couple dozen question answer pairs, as you increase

09:06.320 --> 09:13.480
the amount of data, do you also have to increase, are you also increasing labeled data or do

09:13.480 --> 09:17.480
you have a way to do kind of online labeling?

09:17.480 --> 09:18.480
Right.

09:18.480 --> 09:25.880
We are actually taking advantage of users response by observing user response to infer the

09:25.880 --> 09:31.000
label automatically and then we can able to take advantage of that.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
Okay.

09:32.000 --> 09:38.720
I mentioned a bunch of technologies, deep learning and LP and others, how does that all fit

09:38.720 --> 09:41.920
together to allow you to do all this?

09:41.920 --> 09:46.400
So this is actually, I guess it's fairly obvious to us because we've been working in this

09:46.400 --> 09:48.520
space for a long time.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.600
My background is in question answering.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.600
Okay.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.880
Not enough background is machine learning.

09:53.880 --> 10:01.320
We made IBM several years ago as researchers where you used to be at IBM research in New York

10:01.320 --> 10:05.760
or in Yorktown right here outside of New York.

10:05.760 --> 10:12.200
So when I was at IBM, one of the things is, I was one of the main leads for this IBM Watson

10:12.200 --> 10:18.880
question answering system that you may have seen on TV that we can change at jeopardy.

10:18.880 --> 10:21.760
So I've been working in this question answering domain for a long time.

10:21.760 --> 10:27.400
So one of the things for us, in order to solve customer service issues, you need to figure

10:27.400 --> 10:31.560
out what customer wants, understand what customer wants and the delivered answer they were

10:31.560 --> 10:32.560
looking for.

10:32.560 --> 10:37.160
So in order to do that, you need to use a variety of natural language processing techniques

10:37.160 --> 10:42.560
as well as using machine learning techniques to recognize, understand what customers needs

10:42.560 --> 10:46.560
are and the figure of the right answer.

10:46.560 --> 10:54.200
And so let's take one of those deep learning, for example, how exactly are you, does deep

10:54.200 --> 10:56.400
learning play into what you do?

10:56.400 --> 11:01.440
Yes, so deep learning is very nice in terms of what can take full advantage of all the

11:01.440 --> 11:04.800
available data to deliver high performance.

11:04.800 --> 11:09.600
And as I mentioned, you know, in customer service, you can actually get quite a bit data

11:09.600 --> 11:13.040
compared to a lot of other natural language processing tasks.

11:13.040 --> 11:18.560
Often you can have supervised data based on the prior approach and we are taking full

11:18.560 --> 11:23.280
advantage using deep learning to deliver a better performance.

11:23.280 --> 11:30.880
And so did you, did you base your deep learning models based on, you know, some of the contemporary

11:30.880 --> 11:34.040
industry research, or did you develop them all from scratch?

11:34.040 --> 11:37.320
What helped you get to where you are now?

11:37.320 --> 11:42.280
We are researchers, so we are very familiar with the latest trends in the research community,

11:42.280 --> 11:44.800
latest works.

11:44.800 --> 11:50.360
The specific deep learning approach is what we have come up on our own.

11:50.360 --> 11:55.520
Yeah, there are a lot of things we can see about deep learning, probably the time is not

11:55.520 --> 11:56.520
limited.

11:56.520 --> 11:57.520
Let's get started.

11:57.520 --> 11:58.520
Yeah, just self-promoting.

11:58.520 --> 12:04.560
I have a class teaching, I'm teaching a class at Columbia University on deep learning.

12:04.560 --> 12:07.560
All the slides online, so welcome to our chat.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.560
Okay.

12:08.560 --> 12:11.080
Columbia class, what's the name of the class?

12:11.080 --> 12:16.680
The deep learning for language, speech, and innovation.

12:16.680 --> 12:17.680
And innovation?

12:17.680 --> 12:26.880
Yeah, and I'm probing a little bit into how you guys are using deep learning because I

12:26.880 --> 12:31.720
find that the listeners want, like, stuff that they can go and apply.

12:31.720 --> 12:37.200
What would you tell folks that want to apply deep learning to building their own, you

12:37.200 --> 12:42.520
know, speech models, and maybe even applying it to customer service?

12:42.520 --> 12:46.120
What have you learned that someone else could go use?

12:46.120 --> 12:53.240
Right, so I don't know about speech in particular, but for natural language processing, the key

12:53.240 --> 12:57.120
issue is sparsity.

12:57.120 --> 13:02.720
You tend to have a very high-dimensional sparse space you are working in.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.880
And you want to use deep learning.

13:05.880 --> 13:11.640
You want to reduce this dimension, high-dimension, often you have million dimension, highly-sparse

13:11.640 --> 13:12.640
features.

13:12.640 --> 13:18.640
You want to reduce it into a lower-dimension, dense feature space that can take advantage

13:18.640 --> 13:21.480
of other aspects of deep learning easily.

13:21.480 --> 13:27.080
And what are the features in the space that you guys are working in?

13:27.080 --> 13:29.320
We use a variety of those features.

13:29.320 --> 13:34.040
We actually tend to get extremely sparse, high-dimension features.

13:34.040 --> 13:40.320
Typically, it's word, phrase, other linguistic features, etc., etc.

13:40.320 --> 13:45.560
In any particular technique that you're using for the dimensionality reduction?

13:45.560 --> 13:49.400
We are using our own proprietary projection technique.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.480
Okay, for dimension reduction.

13:51.480 --> 13:52.480
Okay.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.520
And so how about on the NLP side of things?

13:55.520 --> 14:01.160
Anything interesting you can share about your approach with NLP?

14:01.160 --> 14:07.240
One thing I can mention is, in order to, a lot of time you have, you want to start, you

14:07.240 --> 14:12.200
want to have a co-start, a co-start is very important.

14:12.200 --> 14:19.560
What it means co-start is, if you have limited amount of data, you still want to use a deep

14:19.560 --> 14:25.520
learning approach, a co-start can give you high performance even with limited amount

14:25.520 --> 14:26.720
of data.

14:26.720 --> 14:31.920
And so to achieve the ability to do a cold start, are you using transfer learning or are

14:31.920 --> 14:36.240
there other techniques that you're taking advantage of?

14:36.240 --> 14:40.720
Yeah, we, that's one of the core technology we have.

14:40.720 --> 14:45.160
It's the proprietary machine learning technique that actually can do co-start very well.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.160
Okay.

14:46.160 --> 14:47.160
Okay.

14:47.160 --> 14:51.840
Tell me where you are as a company and where the product is as a company, are you generally

14:51.840 --> 14:53.960
available?

14:53.960 --> 15:00.560
So our customers are large enterprises, usually we talk to customer service directors in

15:00.560 --> 15:05.880
large enterprises, we apparently have two pilot partners we work with, and then we

15:05.880 --> 15:12.000
previously licensed our technology to a Fortune 500 company for their in-house intelligent

15:12.000 --> 15:15.120
agent development.

15:15.120 --> 15:21.640
And what can you, what can you say about the kind of the process for going into a new

15:21.640 --> 15:28.480
customer, when you, you know, they say, hey, this sounds great, we want to deploy this.

15:28.480 --> 15:29.480
What does that look like?

15:29.480 --> 15:31.360
What do they have to do?

15:31.360 --> 15:37.240
Usually we make this process really simple, we, we go give them a demo, we, by the time

15:37.240 --> 15:42.760
we talk to them, we already have a demo, using their data, they're publicly available data

15:42.760 --> 15:49.040
up and running, so they can interact with an agent bot for their domain by the time we

15:49.040 --> 15:50.200
walk in the door.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.200
What does that mean?

15:51.200 --> 15:54.680
They're publicly available data, most companies don't have like their support.

15:54.680 --> 15:55.680
Oh, they do.

15:55.680 --> 15:56.680
So think about it.

15:56.680 --> 15:58.880
So for example, think about their tweets.

15:58.880 --> 16:05.320
Oh, okay, they, they, a lot of companies provide customer service to the point, and that

16:05.320 --> 16:06.320
data is public.

16:06.320 --> 16:07.320
Okay.

16:07.320 --> 16:12.680
And we can show how an agent behave on tweets based on their existing human agent tweets.

16:12.680 --> 16:13.680
Okay.

16:13.680 --> 16:16.640
So then we already have something by the time we walk in the door.

16:16.640 --> 16:20.400
And of course, that's just a start, right?

16:20.400 --> 16:25.920
We have, if we have more data from them, do deeper integration, our AI technology can

16:25.920 --> 16:27.240
do a lot more.

16:27.240 --> 16:28.240
Okay.

16:28.240 --> 16:33.920
And then the AI will become smarter, smarter, when he learned to interact with customer

16:33.920 --> 16:36.760
and agents.

16:36.760 --> 16:43.000
How well does, are there any issues associated with transferring or, you know, build training

16:43.000 --> 16:48.480
a model on social data and then sending it off to, to go after emails?

16:48.480 --> 16:51.000
Does it transfer very well or other tricks that you need to do?

16:51.000 --> 16:57.640
So, so there is a little bit, the language usage, if you will, right?

16:57.640 --> 17:01.960
If you look at the way people write tweets, the English is slightly different from the way

17:01.960 --> 17:03.880
they write emails.

17:03.880 --> 17:09.600
And you can even say, if people are on the mobile platform, then they tend to use short

17:09.600 --> 17:15.600
hands for words that you otherwise wouldn't say in, if you're typing out on a full-size

17:15.600 --> 17:16.600
keyboard.

17:16.600 --> 17:22.360
But other than that, yes, we will be able to handle this.

17:22.360 --> 17:29.440
So you go in, you are able to demonstrate some value to them up front based on the social

17:29.440 --> 17:30.440
interactions.

17:30.440 --> 17:37.200
And then they say, let's do this and they want to pull in, you know, more of their proprietary

17:37.200 --> 17:38.200
data.

17:38.200 --> 17:44.280
Are they, are you able to hook up to their existing systems and what systems are those,

17:44.280 --> 17:49.080
are those email, or are they something like a Zendesk or a support system, or...

17:49.080 --> 17:50.080
Right.

17:50.080 --> 17:54.840
So you have this seamless integration with existing ticketing systems they have, whether

17:54.840 --> 18:00.760
that's Zendesk, Salesforce, or Oracle, or any other ticketing system.

18:00.760 --> 18:05.480
So that means it's very easy for them to integrate with our system.

18:05.480 --> 18:11.920
And then do they have to, do you have some kind of console that they use to label and tag

18:11.920 --> 18:16.920
different interactions, or does the system do it all for them?

18:16.920 --> 18:25.080
So we provide a dashboard which gives them a 30,000 feet overview of how things are going.

18:25.080 --> 18:28.760
They can look at how many tickets are coming in, how many tickets are resolved, where the

18:28.760 --> 18:34.080
tickets are coming from, et cetera, et cetera, and they can learn about what are the tickets

18:34.080 --> 18:37.920
that stop being resolved, et cetera, et cetera.

18:37.920 --> 18:45.360
And do you, I imagine that I'm thinking of like a, kind of, you have all these tickets

18:45.360 --> 18:52.800
right, you have some that are being resolved, and are you showing them, is the system

18:52.800 --> 18:58.120
able to figure out and display confidence levels, like, you know, we're pretty sure we

18:58.120 --> 19:01.760
nail these, these, and not so sure.

19:01.760 --> 19:04.400
How does that, is that just displayed on the dashboard?

19:04.400 --> 19:05.400
Yeah.

19:05.400 --> 19:09.040
So we, they can store by the confidence, they can store by the time, they can store

19:09.040 --> 19:13.880
by a number of these criteria, they can do the filtering to, to run report, look at

19:13.880 --> 19:17.720
the tickets.

19:17.720 --> 19:24.200
There are a number of ways for them to, to, to check to run analytics on, on their system.

19:24.200 --> 19:29.600
And then I would imagine, if you're doing this a scale, another thing that would be important

19:29.600 --> 19:35.960
is, for the, the things that you don't, that you haven't been able to resolve correlating

19:35.960 --> 19:41.800
them so that, you know, we've got, you know, a thousand things here that we had no ability

19:41.800 --> 19:45.760
to help out with, but we think that, you know, these two hundred are all kind of about the

19:45.760 --> 19:46.760
same thing.

19:46.760 --> 19:50.840
Is, is that something that you guys, yeah, that, that's a great idea.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.600
That's exactly the direction we are heading as well.

19:53.600 --> 19:54.600
Okay.

19:54.600 --> 19:55.600
Yeah.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.600
Maybe you should work with that.

19:57.600 --> 20:03.080
Can you give it to the other, what are the other things that, that, you know, on that

20:03.080 --> 20:08.600
topic, what are the things that are, you know, either on your roadmap or more generally,

20:08.600 --> 20:14.120
things that you think this space needs to evolve to be able to do in order to fully realize

20:14.120 --> 20:15.880
the vision for customers?

20:15.880 --> 20:16.880
Yeah.

20:16.880 --> 20:20.680
So I think, I think we are in, in the right space.

20:20.680 --> 20:27.000
Our claim is, we think this space that will see more and more issues automatically resolved

20:27.000 --> 20:28.480
by AI.

20:28.480 --> 20:35.400
Imagine 10 years from now, I will say, overwhelming majority of customer service requests will

20:35.400 --> 20:42.320
be automatically responded immediately, only when you have rare cases that requires human

20:42.320 --> 20:47.200
attention and you'll take a little bit longer from human to come back.

20:47.200 --> 20:52.160
And that's, that's across multiple channels.

20:52.160 --> 21:01.960
It's not just email, but also chat, social media, texting, etc., etc.

21:01.960 --> 21:07.880
How did you, of all the things that you could have applied your backgrounds to, you know,

21:07.880 --> 21:10.720
deep learning, NLP, all that stuff is super hot.

21:10.720 --> 21:14.200
How did you come up with customer service?

21:14.200 --> 21:21.160
So here's a story, how I thought it was a story, yes, that's always story, right?

21:21.160 --> 21:27.240
I bought this CPU from New Egg and the New Egg has this price matching policy, right?

21:27.240 --> 21:34.280
So the price dropped, so I called them, I was on hold and then I talked to the agent.

21:34.280 --> 21:37.880
But that wasn't the first time I do this, I've done this before, this price matching

21:37.880 --> 21:38.880
on New Egg before.

21:38.880 --> 21:43.680
So I know exactly the set of questions they ask and exactly how this process works.

21:43.680 --> 21:44.680
Okay.

21:44.680 --> 21:48.760
So as I was going through this, I was, I was, I'll hold and I realized, you know, as annoying

21:48.760 --> 21:54.440
as it is for me, that aging on the other side, he probably even more annoyed because every

21:54.440 --> 21:58.240
day he's going through the same process over and over.

21:58.240 --> 22:02.600
And that's something AI must be able to do.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.800
So that's where I thought, hey, maybe I wanted to talk about, hey, maybe that's something

22:05.800 --> 22:09.840
we should use AI to, to resolve, address this pain point.

22:09.840 --> 22:12.440
Nice, nice.

22:12.440 --> 22:21.040
Tell me a little bit about one of the things that companies that are, you know, marketing

22:21.040 --> 22:27.920
AI technologies to lines of business like support, you know, have to grapple with this

22:27.920 --> 22:33.240
issue of, are we, you know, replacing people, you know, augmenting people, you know, what

22:33.240 --> 22:36.840
are the kinds of questions that your customers are asking and how do you help them think

22:36.840 --> 22:43.400
through, you know, what the role of AI within, you know, with automation and these kinds

22:43.400 --> 22:44.400
of environments?

22:44.400 --> 22:45.400
Yeah.

22:45.400 --> 22:52.840
So clients, their number one concern is customer satisfaction and our goals are aligned.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.760
Our goal is to improve customer satisfaction.

22:54.760 --> 23:00.840
If you look at the customer service, if you can get a 24 hour response time for email,

23:00.840 --> 23:02.560
that's considered good.

23:02.560 --> 23:07.920
And only less than half the company can achieve that goal.

23:07.920 --> 23:14.200
By having AI there, we can reduce the response time significantly and improving the customer

23:14.200 --> 23:17.120
satisfaction.

23:17.120 --> 23:22.000
And from the agent point of view, what we're doing is actually making their jobs more interesting

23:22.000 --> 23:28.560
instead of doing the same thing over and over, they get to do things different and more

23:28.560 --> 23:34.800
difficult, more challenging customer service issues, making a meaningful job for those,

23:34.800 --> 23:38.640
so can deliver customer satisfaction and customers.

23:38.640 --> 23:39.640
Okay.

23:39.640 --> 23:44.680
So the reason why the response times are so slow because they don't have enough and they

23:44.680 --> 23:47.160
can't afford enough customer support people.

23:47.160 --> 23:50.840
So if you can help them use those people more effectively, then it's a win-win for everybody.

23:50.840 --> 23:51.840
Yeah.

23:51.840 --> 23:52.840
Exactly.

23:52.840 --> 23:53.840
Right.

23:53.840 --> 23:59.080
