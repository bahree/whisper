00:00.000 --> 00:16.120
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

00:16.120 --> 00:21.480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:21.480 --> 00:32.440
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:32.440 --> 00:33.840
Contest alert.

00:33.840 --> 00:38.960
This week we have a jam-packed intro, including a new contest we're launching.

00:38.960 --> 00:43.040
So please bear with me, you don't want to miss this one.

00:43.040 --> 00:46.720
First, a bit about this week's shows.

00:46.720 --> 00:51.440
As you may know, I spent a few days at CES earlier this month.

00:51.440 --> 00:56.400
While there, I spoke with a bunch of folks applying AI in the consumer electronics industry,

00:56.400 --> 01:01.040
and I'm including you in those conversations via this series of shows.

01:01.040 --> 01:05.440
Stay tuned as we explore some of the very cool ways that machine learning and AI are being

01:05.440 --> 01:08.600
used to enhance our everyday lives.

01:08.600 --> 01:13.680
This includes work being done at Anki, who built Cosmo, the cutest little computer vision-powered

01:13.680 --> 01:15.280
robot.

01:15.280 --> 01:22.120
Nighthouse, whose smart home security camera combines 3D sensing with deep learning and NLP.

01:22.120 --> 01:28.120
Intel, who's using the single-shot multi-box image detection algorithm to personalize video

01:28.120 --> 01:31.680
fees for the Ferrari Challenge North America.

01:31.680 --> 01:36.480
First beat, a company whose machine learning algorithms analyzed your heartbeat data to

01:36.480 --> 01:42.360
provide personalized insights into stress, exercise, and sleep patterns.

01:42.360 --> 01:48.400
3AI and Koito, who have partnered to bring machine learning-based adaptive driving beams

01:48.400 --> 01:52.280
or automatically adjusting high beams to the U.S.

01:52.280 --> 01:59.480
And last but not least, aerial.ai, who applies sophisticated analytics to Wi-Fi signals to

01:59.480 --> 02:05.640
enable some really interesting home automation and healthcare applications.

02:05.640 --> 02:11.000
Now, as if six amazing interviews wasn't enough, a few of these companies have been so

02:11.000 --> 02:15.520
kind as to provide us with products for you, the Twimmel community.

02:15.520 --> 02:19.360
And keeping with the theme of this series, our contest will be a little different this

02:19.360 --> 02:20.360
time.

02:20.360 --> 02:25.400
To enter, we want to hear from you about the role AI is playing in your home and personal

02:25.400 --> 02:28.640
life, and where you see it going.

02:28.640 --> 02:36.200
Just head on over to Twimmelai.com slash myaicontest, fire up your webcam or smartphone camera,

02:36.200 --> 02:39.120
and tell us your story in two minutes or less.

02:39.120 --> 02:43.600
Go post the videos to YouTube, and the video with the most likes wins their choice of

02:43.600 --> 02:50.480
great prizes, including an Anki Cosmo, a lighthouse smart home camera, and more.

02:50.480 --> 02:55.040
Submissions will be taken until February 11th, and voting will remain open until February

02:55.040 --> 02:56.040
18th.

02:56.040 --> 03:02.360
Good luck.

03:02.360 --> 03:06.560
Before we dive into today's show, I'd like to thank our friends at Intel AI for their

03:06.560 --> 03:09.520
continued support of this podcast.

03:09.520 --> 03:14.760
Intel was extremely active at this year's CES, with a bunch of AI autonomous driving

03:14.760 --> 03:17.200
and VR-related announcements.

03:17.200 --> 03:21.440
One of the more interesting partnerships they announced was a collaboration with the Ferrari

03:21.440 --> 03:24.720
Challenge North America race series.

03:24.720 --> 03:29.440
Along with the folks at Ferrari Challenge, Intel AI aspires to make the race viewing experience

03:29.440 --> 03:35.360
more personalized by using deep computer vision to detect and monitor individual race

03:35.360 --> 03:40.640
cars via camera feeds and allow viewers to choose the specific cars feeds that they'd

03:40.640 --> 03:42.200
like to watch.

03:42.200 --> 03:46.960
Look for my conversation with Intel's Andy Keller and Emil Chindicki earlier in this series

03:46.960 --> 03:52.920
for an in-depth discussion about this project, and be sure to visit ai.intel.com where you'll

03:52.920 --> 03:56.200
find Andy's technical blog post on the topic.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.160
Now about today's show.

03:58.160 --> 04:04.920
In this episode, I'm joined by Michelle Iyege and Negar Gorcian of aerial.ai.

04:04.920 --> 04:09.880
Intel is doing some really interesting things in the home automation space by using Wi-Fi

04:09.880 --> 04:16.440
signal statistics to identify and understand what's happening in our homes and office environments.

04:16.440 --> 04:21.440
Michelle, the CTO, describes some of the capabilities of their platform, including its ability

04:21.440 --> 04:26.040
to detect not only people and pets within the home, but surprising characteristics like

04:26.040 --> 04:28.200
breathing rates and patterns.

04:28.200 --> 04:32.960
He also gives us a look into their data collection process, including the types of data needed,

04:32.960 --> 04:36.200
how they obtain it, and how it's parsed.

04:36.200 --> 04:41.200
Negar, a senior data scientist with aerial, describes the types of models they use, including

04:41.200 --> 04:46.160
semi-supervised, unsupervised, and signal processing-based models, and how they've scaled

04:46.160 --> 04:50.720
their platform, and provides us with some real-world use cases.

04:50.720 --> 04:53.320
And now on to the show.

04:53.320 --> 04:54.960
All right, everyone.

04:54.960 --> 04:59.800
I am on the line with Michelle Iyege and Negar Gorcian.

04:59.800 --> 05:06.280
Michelle is CTO of aerial.ai, and Negar is a senior data scientist there.

05:06.280 --> 05:11.160
Michelle and Negar, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.160
Thank you very much, Sam.

05:12.160 --> 05:14.760
I'm very glad to be here with you.

05:14.760 --> 05:16.760
Thank you very much for having us.

05:16.760 --> 05:17.760
Absolutely.

05:17.760 --> 05:21.560
Why don't we get started by having you tell us a little bit about your backgrounds.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.760
Michelle, why don't you get us started?

05:23.760 --> 05:24.760
Perfect.

05:24.760 --> 05:32.280
Thank you very much, Sam, my background is in the digital scene processing and telecommunications.

05:32.280 --> 05:44.920
I earned master degrees and PhD degrees in Spain in Seville, and then I moved towards to

05:44.920 --> 05:53.280
work with the University College Dublin in Adelaum, and the European Space Agency before

05:53.280 --> 06:01.200
becoming a permanent resident in Canada, which we started an aerial in Montreal in 2015.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.200
Awesome.

06:02.200 --> 06:04.200
And Negar, how about you?

06:04.200 --> 06:10.240
So I started my studies in electrical engineering, and then I moved slightly from my master

06:10.240 --> 06:14.960
towards speech processing, telecommunications, speech recognition.

06:14.960 --> 06:19.800
And that's the first point I got introduced to machine learning field.

06:19.800 --> 06:25.120
And I liked it, I liked working with data and human-centric data specifically.

06:25.120 --> 06:32.560
That's where I decided to start my PhD at McGill University at Montreal in Cambridge Science,

06:32.560 --> 06:38.080
more towards machine learning applications and mining human-centric data.

06:38.080 --> 06:42.000
And then right after that, I joined the aerial as a data scientist.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Awesome.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.000
Awesome.

06:44.000 --> 06:47.000
Why don't you give us a little bit of an overview of what aerial is up to?

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
It seems like a really interesting application.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
Yes.

06:51.000 --> 07:01.800
Well, aerial basically reuse Wi-Fi signals to understand a little bit of context about the environment.

07:01.800 --> 07:09.080
So you have a Wi-Fi signals bouncing all over the places indoors, basically.

07:09.080 --> 07:15.440
And then we'll reuse statistics from the Wi-Fi signal to understand the environment

07:15.440 --> 07:26.160
such as a human presence, a pet's presence, for example, to be applied to a home automation

07:26.160 --> 07:29.400
on health care obligations, basically.

07:29.400 --> 07:35.680
Yeah, I've, I think I've told this story once on the podcast before a few years ago,

07:35.680 --> 07:41.840
I was interested in doing a project around home automation.

07:41.840 --> 07:51.440
And at the time, this was before, before really computer vision with deep learning, you

07:51.440 --> 07:54.720
know, had the advancements, the recent advancements.

07:54.720 --> 08:00.080
And I almost, I pretty much got stuck out of the gate trying to figure out a cost-effective

08:00.080 --> 08:03.360
way to do presence detection.

08:03.360 --> 08:08.160
You know, there were a bunch of different ways to do it, but, you know, we were talking

08:08.160 --> 08:15.720
about things like trying to put NFC receivers by doors and stuff like that, and it was really

08:15.720 --> 08:16.720
messy.

08:16.720 --> 08:23.480
And now there's a bunch of interesting ways to do it, including just put cameras by doors

08:23.480 --> 08:26.680
and do object detection.

08:26.680 --> 08:32.440
But what you're offering seems to be a really interesting way to just piggyback of stuff

08:32.440 --> 08:34.120
that's already there.

08:34.120 --> 08:41.120
Exactly, exactly, that's the main, our main purpose is some, to reuse those water scenes

08:41.120 --> 08:47.480
that, when no one is at home, they behave in a very particular way, when someone just

08:47.480 --> 08:54.120
show up, they behave completely different, and that's, that's when, when the, our work

08:54.120 --> 08:59.320
starts to identify, by identifying those patterns.

08:59.320 --> 09:04.320
Can you tell us a little bit about the science behind it and what makes it work?

09:04.320 --> 09:12.040
I'm imagining, you know, it just has to do with kind of the density and water content of

09:12.040 --> 09:18.600
our bodies, and they change the radio waves bounce around, but I'm sure there's a lot

09:18.600 --> 09:20.400
more detail to it there.

09:20.400 --> 09:23.040
Yes, yes, it's a pleasure to.

09:23.040 --> 09:31.800
So actually, Wi-Fi is a pretty smart system, and it's all the time sensing the environment.

09:31.800 --> 09:33.960
And that's exactly what we use.

09:33.960 --> 09:42.640
We use any statistic from physical layer up to link layer, and by looking at these statistics,

09:42.640 --> 09:51.000
you have, you're basically sensing the environment with any two Wi-Fi devices that are connected

09:51.000 --> 09:57.480
each other, let's say you're routed on your TV, we are already sensing in that, in that

09:57.480 --> 09:58.480
scenario.

09:58.480 --> 10:05.080
And basically, your body, while your body moves through those signals, your body disturbs

10:05.080 --> 10:12.720
those signals in a very particular way, depending on what you're doing, how fast you're going,

10:12.720 --> 10:16.720
and what are the activities you're involved in, basically.

10:16.720 --> 10:24.320
Well, machine learning and AI comes to the, well, we start with the pattern recognition,

10:24.320 --> 10:30.880
but it's more complex, more complex than that, and it's actually machine learning and AI

10:30.880 --> 10:40.240
is the answer to our research questions, and it's providing us with very good results.

10:40.240 --> 10:46.040
That's what we are using machine learning and AI today.

10:46.040 --> 10:52.320
So maybe Nagar, can you tell us a little bit about the pipelines that you use and the types

10:52.320 --> 10:56.920
of data that you're collecting, how you're collecting it, and how you're turning that

10:56.920 --> 10:58.120
into models?

10:58.120 --> 11:00.400
Oh, yeah, sure.

11:00.400 --> 11:08.600
So what we do is that technically, we use Wi-Fi enabled devices in indoor spaces to scan

11:08.600 --> 11:13.760
and record these Wi-Fi statistics that Michelle mentioned.

11:13.760 --> 11:20.760
So technically, we are turning the routers and Wi-Fi enabled devices to some cameras.

11:20.760 --> 11:27.600
Let's say the hidden camera is to scan the environment where these Wi-Fi signal propagates,

11:27.600 --> 11:35.000
and then anything that any event and motion that happens within an indoor space affects

11:35.000 --> 11:43.080
that data statistics, and that's where we, through the routers of each household, we scan

11:43.080 --> 11:48.080
these statistics, we send it to the cloud, and that's where we start processing the data

11:48.080 --> 11:49.080
from.

11:49.080 --> 11:55.920
How granular can you get with the data off of the Wi-Fi routers?

11:55.920 --> 12:01.080
Is it able to tell you, is it able to uniquely identify individuals within a home or just

12:01.080 --> 12:07.840
that maybe that there's someone there, or you mentioned pets, how much detail can you

12:07.840 --> 12:09.560
get out of these signals?

12:09.560 --> 12:16.360
Yes, it's a very fine-grained data sum, and we, as you mentioned before, we are able

12:16.360 --> 12:22.760
to identify different users by the body mass and the way they move on the space.

12:22.760 --> 12:30.120
And these signals could be as sensitive as that we are able to detect a breathing rate,

12:30.120 --> 12:40.720
for example, in the right position, by the action of being breathing, you're moving your

12:40.720 --> 12:48.160
chest, and thus modulating our signals as well, and we are capable of detecting a breathing

12:48.160 --> 12:49.480
rate, for example.

12:49.480 --> 12:52.280
It could be as granular as that.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.280
That is incredible.

12:53.280 --> 12:59.880
I find that really difficult to wrap my head around.

12:59.880 --> 13:08.640
Is this all done without requiring me to change the access points I'm using, or do I

13:08.640 --> 13:13.160
need to use specialized devices?

13:13.160 --> 13:16.320
You don't need to use any specialized devices.

13:16.320 --> 13:22.720
Wi-Fi devices, and we look at statistics within the Wi-Fi standards.

13:22.720 --> 13:29.440
Do you require some of the newer Wi-Fi mesh networking technologies, or I've got

13:29.440 --> 13:36.760
one standard kind of old Wi-Fi router, and I guess are you also looking at, do you also

13:36.760 --> 13:42.000
get statistics reported from the client devices, or is it just the access point?

13:42.000 --> 13:48.520
It could be from both sides, actually, or one of the size involved.

13:48.520 --> 13:53.680
It could be one client, for example, and we collect data in the client and send it up

13:53.680 --> 13:59.400
to the cloud, or we could be on the router looking at multiple clients at the same time.

13:59.400 --> 14:03.120
And we upload the information.

14:03.120 --> 14:13.240
So, as long as you have end devices in your home, IEEE, AOT 2011, and above, we're good

14:13.240 --> 14:14.240
to go.

14:14.240 --> 14:17.440
There's a new one coming out soon, I just read about, is it X?

14:17.440 --> 14:18.440
Yes, yes.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.640
There are new standards coming up.

14:20.640 --> 14:26.320
All of them are improving, actually, and are providing even more fine-grained data to

14:26.320 --> 14:27.920
us, actually.

14:27.920 --> 14:35.640
And the better that Wi-Fi gets, the best for us.

14:35.640 --> 14:39.920
Mesh is also a very interesting topology for us to be in.

14:39.920 --> 14:44.120
We are very excited to work in Mesh, as well.

14:44.120 --> 14:49.960
So I've got my Wi-Fi network and my access point, various clients.

14:49.960 --> 14:50.960
How do you collect data?

14:50.960 --> 14:57.440
Do you have, is there like a mobile client or something like that, or is it another device

14:57.440 --> 14:59.520
type that you're introducing?

14:59.520 --> 15:06.920
Basically, well, if we can upgrade the firmware in your router, that would be the ideal point

15:06.920 --> 15:16.560
to be in, as we're going to be deploying the system very soon with one of our ISPs.

15:16.560 --> 15:17.800
That's the way we're going to use.

15:17.800 --> 15:23.880
So we just need to update your router, for example, your ISPs router.

15:23.880 --> 15:31.440
We could also be in one dumb client that we could provide you with, and the agent that

15:31.440 --> 15:39.160
collects the data and send it to the cloud is in these small devices that we could provide

15:39.160 --> 15:40.400
as well.

15:40.400 --> 15:46.440
But as long as we can update anything where of any of your devices, we are ready to go

15:46.440 --> 15:47.440
from there.

15:47.440 --> 15:54.040
Okay, so is the implication then that the business model, at least as you envision it today,

15:54.040 --> 16:03.760
is less direct to consumer and more, either via an OEM with a router or via an ISP relationship

16:03.760 --> 16:07.240
or something like that, where they can change the firmware for you?

16:07.240 --> 16:08.240
Exactly.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.240
Yes.

16:09.240 --> 16:12.080
We're going through ISPs initially.

16:12.080 --> 16:19.200
That way we feel as well that we could get to a big marker.

16:19.200 --> 16:26.400
But of course, the users is the same, either you go directly consumer or through ISPs,

16:26.400 --> 16:31.760
at the end you have the same users, at the end you have, you want to provide a very cheap

16:31.760 --> 16:36.880
security system, for example, to your customers, where you're going through an ISP or you're

16:36.880 --> 16:38.400
going directly.

16:38.400 --> 16:46.520
We have chosen the ISP because it's a very good business model, it's very clever, that's

16:46.520 --> 16:48.240
the way we're going to start.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.640
So you're collecting this data.

16:51.640 --> 17:02.680
Can you be more specific about the types of data that you require, the specific types

17:02.680 --> 17:03.680
of values?

17:03.680 --> 17:04.680
Yes.

17:04.680 --> 17:11.200
For example, we collect every data available at physical layer, for example, and we all

17:11.200 --> 17:12.200
upload that.

17:12.200 --> 17:23.200
Let's say RSSI, RSSI values, let's say commuting on the RAID on your device, let's say channel

17:23.200 --> 17:32.000
information, we collect all these types of data and all of them are very sensitive to

17:32.000 --> 17:36.000
what's happening in the environment, and we work from there.

17:36.000 --> 17:42.520
We start summarizing, we start doing a feature extraction on top of that, until we reach

17:42.520 --> 17:46.840
to our processing engine with the models and models.

17:46.840 --> 17:47.840
Okay.

17:47.840 --> 17:55.040
So you've got all this data, it's uploaded to the cloud, Nagar, how do you even start

17:55.040 --> 18:03.600
to build models around this, for example, are these supervised models, and how are you

18:03.600 --> 18:06.840
training against this type of data?

18:06.840 --> 18:12.280
Yeah, it's a very tricky and interesting question.

18:12.280 --> 18:19.960
So we receive these variety types and a huge amount of data from each house.

18:19.960 --> 18:26.920
And then depending on the task we have on hand, we decide to choose an algorithm or a learning

18:26.920 --> 18:32.280
method that actually minimizes the requirement for query the user very often.

18:32.280 --> 18:37.720
So we try to go with the setups that we don't really need to get through labels from the

18:37.720 --> 18:45.560
actual users, but we try to like kind of like unsupervised setup or semi supervised learning

18:45.560 --> 18:49.920
setups that be good, a minimum amount of information from the environment, from the

18:49.920 --> 18:50.920
user per se.

18:50.920 --> 18:56.680
And then the rest of is it's on us to actually predict models, build models.

18:56.680 --> 19:05.480
In some applications, we could go fully unsupervised like the security application, but as more

19:05.480 --> 19:10.800
complicated tasks comes in, like activity recognition or healthcare applications, that's

19:10.800 --> 19:17.560
where actually we will need the minimum amount of like label provided by the users, or we

19:17.560 --> 19:25.520
could have extract these raw labels automatically from the rest of the feature space we extract

19:25.520 --> 19:27.440
and use them as reference point.

19:27.440 --> 19:35.360
And over time, as a user, use their application more and more, we get, we correct our models

19:35.360 --> 19:39.280
technically based on the first initial models that we built.

19:39.280 --> 19:40.280
Hmm.

19:40.280 --> 19:45.720
Can you give me an example of how you're able to automatically extract labels from the

19:45.720 --> 19:46.720
data set?

19:46.720 --> 19:47.720
Yeah.

19:47.720 --> 19:55.280
Uh, for example, um, we have some, some specific features that we extract from the

19:55.280 --> 20:01.280
writers directly, uh, gives us a rough estimation or even like sometimes a very good estimation

20:01.280 --> 20:07.080
of a location of a user with respect to the fixed anchors that you have at home, right?

20:07.080 --> 20:12.720
So that will roughly give you an estimation of a location of a person and then using the

20:12.720 --> 20:18.360
time of the day and the pattern of move as part of the amount of motion that each person

20:18.360 --> 20:24.680
has 24 seven, that can kind of roughly give you a good idea of that, like, how was that

20:24.680 --> 20:28.440
user moving and behaving throughout the day?

20:28.440 --> 20:29.440
Hmm.

20:29.440 --> 20:30.440
Okay.

20:30.440 --> 20:34.760
So I'm imagining things like you can figure out how many of the devices, how many of the

20:34.760 --> 20:39.000
clients are cell phones and that gives you a sense of the number of people that are

20:39.000 --> 20:44.440
in the home and then you can like at night, the cell phones are probably not moving and

20:44.440 --> 20:49.800
you kind of know where they are in the home and, uh, you can start to build some labels

20:49.800 --> 20:50.800
from there.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.640
Is that the general idea?

20:52.640 --> 20:56.440
That is, that is like something that we definitely think about and we can, but we're

20:56.440 --> 21:00.600
not limited to those type of getting, yeah, we can use those information about different

21:00.600 --> 21:04.840
users getting connected to a writer, we have access to that, then we sit in a writer.

21:04.840 --> 21:09.360
You have access to those kind of information, but necessarily it's not the only source

21:09.360 --> 21:13.800
of information we extract, but definitely the goal is what you mentioned to actually learn

21:13.800 --> 21:19.640
the pattern of like the behavior of each individual user that lives in a household over time.

21:19.640 --> 21:24.000
You know, we start off with some general models and general assumptions about how people

21:24.000 --> 21:27.680
leave in the house, how do you move, where they to go, when they leave home, when they

21:27.680 --> 21:35.400
come back and then these general assumptions will get edited over time with, with different

21:35.400 --> 21:40.360
models that we have and the models get updated, particularly for each house.

21:40.360 --> 21:41.360
Mm-hmm.

21:41.360 --> 21:48.240
So I kind of get that in the, the general case of kind of presence detection, but when

21:48.240 --> 21:55.680
we're talking about, uh, the, the breathing example that Michelle mentioned, which, uh,

21:55.680 --> 21:59.240
you also mentioned healthcare use cases, I'm assuming that is related to a healthcare

21:59.240 --> 22:00.880
use case.

22:00.880 --> 22:07.040
How do you, how do you begin to build a model around, uh, around that, uh, you mean about

22:07.040 --> 22:08.040
breathing rate?

22:08.040 --> 22:09.040
Right.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.040
Right.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.040
Yeah.

22:11.040 --> 22:15.760
So in those cases, most of the techniques that we would use is like signal processing and

22:15.760 --> 22:22.440
like more of, uh, time series analysis, findings, is an all day finding, uh, the curiosity

22:22.440 --> 22:27.960
in the signal, that's more of those type of, uh, techniques we would use to actually find

22:27.960 --> 22:28.960
the pattern.

22:28.960 --> 22:32.700
The breathing rate is something sick like and then, uh, it's, it's something that you

22:32.700 --> 22:37.800
could actually detect and, uh, information, uh, with regard to presence detection that

22:37.800 --> 22:43.040
you mentioned, uh, no matter like presence detection could be like for us, it has a different

22:43.040 --> 22:44.040
definition.

22:44.040 --> 22:49.400
When you have movements or like very intense movements, that's easier, easier to, to figure

22:49.400 --> 22:50.400
out.

22:50.400 --> 22:56.160
Also, when you sit somewhere or we're, you're trying to space city or when you're asleep,

22:56.160 --> 23:01.640
that presence detection in that level is just, we are looking into finer, like finer

23:01.640 --> 23:08.320
grade, like motion and activities that it just presents off a body with, with have on

23:08.320 --> 23:11.840
the data and then figure out that there is someone there.

23:11.840 --> 23:16.560
And then someone is breathing or someone having very micro movements versus when it houses

23:16.560 --> 23:17.560
empty.

23:17.560 --> 23:18.560
Right.

23:18.560 --> 23:19.560
Right.

23:19.560 --> 23:27.120
Just the presence, when you even think about the, the notion of presence, you're trying

23:27.120 --> 23:34.720
to pull out a rich set of, um, you know, parameters, localization of the people in house

23:34.720 --> 23:35.720
things like that.

23:35.720 --> 23:38.080
It's not just empty or a person in the house.

23:38.080 --> 23:39.080
Nope.

23:39.080 --> 23:42.880
That's, that's improving with the, with the different applications we're developing.

23:42.880 --> 23:43.880
Right.

23:43.880 --> 23:44.880
Right.

23:44.880 --> 23:52.840
When you have applications that require, um, some type of labeling, it sounds like maybe

23:52.840 --> 23:58.880
you're doing that via direct input via mobile device or something.

23:58.880 --> 24:05.400
In some cases, yes, we could get the direct entries from a query user that, uh, to, to

24:05.400 --> 24:10.800
give feedback or label on some particular activity or some particular state of the house.

24:10.800 --> 24:11.800
For example.

24:11.800 --> 24:16.960
But the idea is just to, just to talk to complement a little bit on that, but the idea is to actually

24:16.960 --> 24:20.920
minimize, minimize the query to the user.

24:20.920 --> 24:26.800
Um, for example, in applications such as elderly care, a health care, in particular,

24:26.800 --> 24:32.640
elderly care, uh, we don't see the user interacting too much with our system.

24:32.640 --> 24:33.640
Right.

24:33.640 --> 24:39.560
So we are generating more auto generating our labels, uh, to fit the different type of models

24:39.560 --> 24:45.800
we use, uh, but, but, but for, of course, you, you cannot expect too, too many labels

24:45.800 --> 24:52.560
or, or be interacting too much, uh, for, for this particular application, uh, it's not

24:52.560 --> 24:59.840
difficult to figure out, for example, uh, where the, you know, how people walking, walking

24:59.840 --> 25:07.120
in the bathroom looks like, how people walking in the bathroom looks like, how, you know,

25:07.120 --> 25:11.920
the, uh, brushing teeth looks like it's because you, you could correlate with the time of

25:11.920 --> 25:17.280
the day, um, when they take the actions from, from the moment they, they start walking,

25:17.280 --> 25:20.320
uh, in the morning or at any time.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.320
Wow.

25:21.320 --> 25:31.520
Um, how does the system, uh, how does the system scale in the sense of the, you know,

25:31.520 --> 25:39.280
number of individuals per access point? I guess I'm wondering like what the, you know,

25:39.280 --> 25:46.200
what the, um, I guess I'm wondering if you have multiple people like, if you go from

25:46.200 --> 25:50.320
a house environment to an office environment or something like that, do you start to lose

25:50.320 --> 25:55.720
your ability to get fine-grained information about what's happening within the environment

25:55.720 --> 26:02.800
or deep, does it stay, is it your visibility proportional to the number of access points

26:02.800 --> 26:06.440
and as you increase people, you increase access points and you're, you're still good.

26:06.440 --> 26:07.800
Like, what are the issues there?

26:07.800 --> 26:13.200
Uh, yes, exactly. Uh, definitely the, the fewer number of people that you have in the

26:13.200 --> 26:19.920
sensing area, uh, the better. So let's define a sensing area, such as your access point

26:19.920 --> 26:25.440
on one client connected to it. So your sensing, one specific area, because these two

26:25.440 --> 26:31.480
devices have fixed. Uh, let's say, uh, the more granularity you want with more people

26:31.480 --> 26:38.160
around, you will need to increase the number of independent sensing areas. Uh, that will

26:38.160 --> 26:43.760
give you enough resolution to keep working. But of course, if we are talking about, if

26:43.760 --> 26:50.760
we move from, from residential applications towards more commercial or business settings,

26:50.760 --> 27:01.080
uh, you will lose a solution. Uh, it's not the same to, uh, to track five, six, uh, people

27:01.080 --> 27:07.440
versus a 50 to 100 people. Right. Uh, it's very interesting. Actually, we, we are doing

27:07.440 --> 27:14.400
it today. Uh, we have, uh, deployments in large offices. Uh, the patterns are very,

27:14.400 --> 27:20.840
uh, very interesting over day, overnight, over weekends, over holidays. It's very, very

27:20.840 --> 27:25.760
interesting. Uh, uh, but, but of course, you lose, uh, a little bit of resolution in terms

27:25.760 --> 27:31.760
of, you know, who's walking there within a hundred users, right? Yeah. You mentioned the

27:31.760 --> 27:38.160
sensing area is an access point and a client connection. Uh, it's got to help you that

27:38.160 --> 27:44.360
pretty much everyone is walking around with a client nowadays. And so each individual,

27:44.360 --> 27:52.640
each incremental person, does that create, uh, it's own sensing area if they've got a mobile

27:52.640 --> 28:01.400
device? Yes, for sure. And, and you know that that device is moving, um, and we can use

28:01.400 --> 28:08.600
it. Uh, we, we are, we are doing it and we are planning to, to rely on devices as well.

28:08.600 --> 28:14.480
But let's say like the beauty of our technology and when we are spending more time, it's

28:14.480 --> 28:20.760
in natural doses scenarios where you are not carrying your mobile with you. Okay. And

28:20.760 --> 28:24.200
if you think about it, use, you know, one of the first things that probably you do when

28:24.200 --> 28:32.000
you get home is to get rid of of yourself for a little bit. And we don't, we don't want

28:32.000 --> 28:36.960
to, to lose the, the type of information. You know, you're walking, you want to arrive

28:36.960 --> 28:42.560
home, you want to probably relax. So we want to know that, we want to know that to give

28:42.560 --> 28:48.360
you the, the right tone of your lights. We want to turn on your TV, for example, on your

28:48.360 --> 28:54.160
favorite channel. And we want to prepare this scenario for you, even if you're not wearing

28:54.160 --> 28:59.960
a mobile, but we don't see you controlling the home with your mobile all the time next

28:59.960 --> 29:05.600
to you. Uh, oh, and you everywhere. Uh, this is a really fascinating application. When

29:05.600 --> 29:13.040
can we, as the consumers expect, uh, you know, see this, you know, more broadly available?

29:13.040 --> 29:22.160
Well, this year we are deploying, uh, with one of the largest ISPs in the world. Unfortunately,

29:22.160 --> 29:31.560
I cannot reveal the name yet. But it's huge. We'll be with them in a piece of mine application

29:31.560 --> 29:38.640
for families to know, uh, to know where there are people at home or not, uh, who has arrived

29:38.640 --> 29:47.280
home and prepare, you know, um, kind of a home automation, uh, type of applications, as

29:47.280 --> 29:55.840
well as we are, uh, we're also working very hard for our elderly care applications, because

29:55.840 --> 30:03.040
the, uh, well, the market is huge as well there. And it's so, uh, we are very fascinated

30:03.040 --> 30:08.200
about the elderly care application. We can provide so much information to the caregivers

30:08.200 --> 30:14.560
and even to the doctors of those patients, uh, that is, they don't have it today. There

30:14.560 --> 30:20.520
is no way, uh, without the camera that you can tell how many times a person is going

30:20.520 --> 30:26.120
to the bathroom, how much time he's spending on the bathroom versus taking a shower. So

30:26.120 --> 30:32.120
it is so, the pressure is so high because we can do it, uh, that we will love to go to

30:32.120 --> 30:38.600
the market right away. We would love to extend elderly population, uh, time at home as

30:38.600 --> 30:43.400
much as we can. And even, even after being the child for the hospital, let's say for

30:43.400 --> 30:48.000
something, we would like to track to, to see that everything is, is, is going well at

30:48.000 --> 30:55.800
home. Mm hmm. And is the resolution fine enough such that you can detect, uh, like

30:55.800 --> 31:02.480
fall events, uh, and things like that? Uh, yes, actually, that is one of the most

31:02.480 --> 31:07.240
interesting applications that we started off and many people are asking for. So fall

31:07.240 --> 31:11.840
detection is one of the major actually goals that we're setting for our elderly care

31:11.840 --> 31:18.360
application. And, uh, because it's happening in a, right, in a part, usually mostly it's

31:18.360 --> 31:23.920
happening in some shower areas, map areas, uh, we have very, I hope to get it. And sooner

31:23.920 --> 31:30.000
when we start working, uh, more, more focusedly on our, uh, elderly care application.

31:30.000 --> 31:37.800
And what do you expect the approach to be to detect falls based on this data? Is it, you

31:37.800 --> 31:43.880
know, is it kind of a supervise, you know, finding a bunch of labeled falls and training

31:43.880 --> 31:49.320
against them? How do you, how do you get to that? Yeah. Well, we will definitely starting

31:49.320 --> 31:55.520
off with the following, making a lot of fake falls in the office, probably to get a grasp

31:55.520 --> 32:01.880
of how does this look like? But, uh, but more seriously, we're following to actually, uh,

32:01.880 --> 32:07.320
go and work with elderly care facility, like facilities that they are taking care of

32:07.320 --> 32:14.040
a lot of, a lot of, uh, like people and patients that leave in those centers and actually

32:14.040 --> 32:19.160
fall is something that's very, very often happens there. And they have already studied a lot

32:19.160 --> 32:24.400
of studies. They're getting a lot of data about falling. How does it happen? When does it

32:24.400 --> 32:29.680
happen? Probabilities around that accident, particular accident, which is very, very common

32:29.680 --> 32:36.240
in the, in the population. Um, and then when we learned enough about the patterns and

32:36.240 --> 32:41.600
the stuff that we are trying to features and all the statistics that we're looking for

32:41.600 --> 32:46.400
to distinguish a fall, we will go more towards when we want to apply this, we definitely

32:46.400 --> 32:53.400
will are going to be applying some anomaly detection, algorithm, some abnormal detection,

32:53.400 --> 33:00.400
which you, yeah, predictive analysis based on the based on the pattern of the, the patients

33:00.400 --> 33:04.960
or the elderly person's movement during the day or during past days, because there's

33:04.960 --> 33:11.000
a lot of like medical studies about that. All of these falls, they don't usually happen,

33:11.000 --> 33:15.600
like, and, and, and announce too much. It's not random. Like, there's a lot of symptoms

33:15.600 --> 33:20.080
that happens before that, which is alerting. And then we're going to be using all of those

33:20.080 --> 33:25.760
information. We're going to get people experts in those areas to help us to actually build

33:25.760 --> 33:30.200
up this model. But the regarding the learning procedure probably is going to, we're going

33:30.200 --> 33:34.560
to start off differently with some sort of revised learning algorithm to build up models.

33:34.560 --> 33:38.840
We're going to definitely use some active learning and other segments of our learning techniques

33:38.840 --> 33:45.040
to improve that based on the symptomatic information we will get from the expert experts

33:45.040 --> 33:52.760
in this area. And, and then, yeah, well, we use the pattern of normal versus, versus abnormal

33:52.760 --> 33:58.320
on this, like, particular random things that happens. Then we'll be off without without

33:58.320 --> 34:04.680
involving user. We'll be able to actually predict that first to, to try to avoid and warn

34:04.680 --> 34:10.840
health care caregivers that the, this particular patient with the pattern that you walk to the

34:10.840 --> 34:14.840
part of the amount of activity level that it has. It's very probable that's going to

34:14.840 --> 34:22.360
have a fall in a couple of few days. Or if, if it happens, we will know and will, will

34:22.360 --> 34:24.480
inform the caregivers.

34:24.480 --> 34:34.040
Interesting. How are you approaching the general issue of privacy in deploying systems like

34:34.040 --> 34:35.040
this?

34:35.040 --> 34:41.840
Yes. It's a very interesting question. And, first of all, well, we anonymize our data.

34:41.840 --> 34:47.800
That's the first step when, when they got right, and I start looking at data, those are

34:47.800 --> 34:55.880
non-names already. So, those are numbers and tokens. So, that's the first step we take.

34:55.880 --> 35:03.920
We anonymize the data. You have to understand that before our processing engines arrive,

35:03.920 --> 35:09.560
all the data that is there, no one can understand that, that data. So, it's, it's, it's, it's

35:09.560 --> 35:18.320
meaningless. It's just raw data, going up to the, to the cloud. Even though it's encrypted,

35:18.320 --> 35:27.040
all the links between our agents and the cloud, the cloud itself, from cloud to agents to

35:27.040 --> 35:33.440
go to a, to a, to a, to all, all, all, all is encrypted. Or in the cloud for us are

35:33.440 --> 35:40.760
tokens, especially anonymized data that, that we work with. It's just only at the end when

35:40.760 --> 35:48.520
we present the results to the user that this data might sense. It's only there when, you

35:48.520 --> 35:55.400
know, that path is encrypted. It's only when you present data to the user when you assemble

35:55.400 --> 36:02.800
again, the entire, the whole, the whole set of information, let's say. Do you or the company

36:02.800 --> 36:10.680
have any philosophical perspective on the issue of privacy as it applies to, you know,

36:10.680 --> 36:16.560
this kind of technology with, with, which I think really brings a level of transparency

36:16.560 --> 36:22.800
to, you know, presence and activity in the home that most people probably aren't used

36:22.800 --> 36:29.880
to. Exactly. And, and you, you just have to look at our applications, right? The type of

36:29.880 --> 36:37.320
data we're going to collect, the only goal is to detect, to be very good at detecting with

36:37.320 --> 36:43.240
really high values of through positive and very low false positive values, try to really

36:43.240 --> 36:49.120
aggregate the, the events that we are, that we are interested for only the, the purpose

36:49.120 --> 36:56.640
of our final, the, our final presentation to the user. As you can see in a security system,

36:56.640 --> 37:02.440
well, we just telling the users, you know, someone is at home. Right. And it's, it's not

37:02.440 --> 37:08.480
normal. This time of the day, since the, the, the history we have from, from you, this

37:08.480 --> 37:14.040
is not normal. For elderly care, it's true. We will be looking at the very fine, rain

37:14.040 --> 37:19.880
activities, but the entire goal, the, the outcome of all of that will be, you know, this

37:19.880 --> 37:29.280
patient had a normal day today. So, everything seems normal. Don't worry. Versus, or something

37:29.280 --> 37:35.960
has happened. This is not a normal day for this patient. Or a fall has happened. So, those

37:35.960 --> 37:41.520
type of, those type of the, of outputs are the ones that we'll be providing. And the

37:41.520 --> 37:46.320
only, we will use the data only to provide very accurate outputs.

37:46.320 --> 37:52.680
Yeah. I mean, it strikes me that, you know, we talk a lot about the, the smart home,

37:52.680 --> 38:00.440
but generally speaking, you know, that really is devices in the home, getting smarter.

38:00.440 --> 38:07.320
But this, you know, offers the possibility of having, you know, the home itself via the,

38:07.320 --> 38:13.680
the wireless network really start to know a lot about what's happening inside of it. And

38:13.680 --> 38:19.840
that could potentially create a lot of opportunities for the devices themselves to then take advantage

38:19.840 --> 38:25.120
of this and, and do more interesting things. So, it's really interesting. And I appreciate

38:25.120 --> 38:30.880
you taking the time to, you know, share with us a little bit about what you're up to.

38:30.880 --> 38:37.240
And thanks to you, it's been a, honestly, with this type of technologies, when actually

38:37.240 --> 38:42.520
we are unlocking the, the IoT market, because at the beginning, there was like a chicken

38:42.520 --> 38:49.960
and egg problem. So, I have to put devices inside my home, but for what purposes? So,

38:49.960 --> 38:54.840
what will be the application? And so, this type of technology are unlocking there, because

38:54.840 --> 39:01.120
you already have the sensing system there. So, let's start using it. That's, that's, that's,

39:01.120 --> 39:07.480
that's our main purpose. Yeah. Now, it's, it's really interesting. In fact, I'm, I'm

39:07.480 --> 39:12.200
so close, I picked it up in my hand. Now, I've got a, I recently started playing around

39:12.200 --> 39:19.920
with home automation and smart home stuff. And I have this little Sylvania, like, presence

39:19.920 --> 39:28.680
detector thing that's hooked up to the Samsung Smart Things Hub. And it generally works.

39:28.680 --> 39:35.320
It's a little flaky. But in order to, you know, really automate the home, you have to put

39:35.320 --> 39:39.600
these things all over. And you're telling me that I already have what I need. I just

39:39.600 --> 39:46.520
need to start collecting some data and train some models. Which, of course, it makes

39:46.520 --> 39:53.280
it sound really easy when you say it like that. But, or wait for, for Ariel to, you know,

39:53.280 --> 39:58.760
show up in my router at some point. Thank you very much. Yeah. And then one more thing

39:58.760 --> 40:03.080
I would like to add is that we have to look at when we talk about the philosophy of company,

40:03.080 --> 40:07.600
you could just look back at alternatives that we have right away for doing the same things

40:07.600 --> 40:12.400
that we're trying to do. So, in order to monitor an elderly person, you would need to

40:12.400 --> 40:17.800
make them wear a variable, which is very annoying for them. And it needs a lot of cooperation

40:17.800 --> 40:23.560
for the person. And the other alternative is what using cameras for security, which

40:23.560 --> 40:30.000
is avoiding the privacy way more than our data would ever could, right? Because camera

40:30.000 --> 40:36.080
data images and videos or microphones that right now has been used for, for security

40:36.080 --> 40:42.880
or for home security and home smart homes, they're wearing more transpired data that anyone

40:42.880 --> 40:47.960
could pick up, look at them and see what's going on in your life. Whereas like, our data

40:47.960 --> 40:52.840
is something that's need a huge amount of processing, which you need to have, like, spend

40:52.840 --> 40:58.000
hours and hours to just make sense about like, semantic that's going on. So you also have

40:58.000 --> 41:03.640
to look at the alternatives that we have these days for for doing exactly the same jobs

41:03.640 --> 41:11.680
or like, as you mentioned, also heavily putting a lot of sensors and actually, and putting

41:11.680 --> 41:17.040
a lot of systems, a lot of sensors and a lot of hardwares in your house, we're just replacing

41:17.040 --> 41:24.240
all of them with something that already exists at your place. And that is a bigger help,

41:24.240 --> 41:29.560
I think, we're trying to do. Yeah, I think that's a really, really good

41:29.560 --> 41:36.440
point. I've talked about on the podcast, I think in the context of maybe the same kind

41:36.440 --> 41:45.160
of thing, presence and possibly home automation, this idea that actually for many applications,

41:45.160 --> 41:52.560
the cameras becoming the universal sensor, and certainly you can do this stuff with multiple

41:52.560 --> 41:57.680
cameras at least, depending on the number of entrances and exits and rooms you have

41:57.680 --> 42:03.080
in your house and all that kind of stuff. But, you know, it's much more invasive, I think,

42:03.080 --> 42:15.000
as you're suggesting. And it's much more susceptible to being misused or abused because

42:15.000 --> 42:24.080
the raw data itself, you know, is easily interpretable as opposed to RSSI values and channel

42:24.080 --> 42:29.160
noise and stuff like that, that, you know, you have to run it through some pretty sophisticated

42:29.160 --> 42:34.960
algorithms to make sense of. So I definitely get that and it makes a lot of sense. And I'm

42:34.960 --> 42:41.000
looking forward to kind of keeping an eye on Ariel and, you know, what you guys are up

42:41.000 --> 42:42.000
to.

42:42.000 --> 42:46.840
Yes, we would love to keep you posted, keep you posted with the progress of the company

42:46.840 --> 42:53.040
and the lines of the different lines of products that we will be launching.

42:53.040 --> 42:57.840
