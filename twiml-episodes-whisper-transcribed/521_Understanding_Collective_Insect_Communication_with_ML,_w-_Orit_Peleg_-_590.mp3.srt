00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,720
All right, everyone. Welcome to another episode of the Twinmal AI podcast. I'm your host,

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:17,600
Sam Charrington, and today I'm joined by Ori Kellegg, an assistant professor at CU Boulder.

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,960
Excited for this conversation. We're going to be talking about your research into collective

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,800
communication in insect swarms. And I've already learned that there are multiple species of

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,600
firefly. It never occurred to me that that was the case. We'll dig into that and a lot more.

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,960
But before we do, I'd love to have you share a little bit about your background and

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,640
how you came to work with machine learning. Sure. So my background is pretty interdisciplinary,

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,320
and even within the realm of interdisciplinary backgrounds, I think it's a little bit all over

12
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,720
the place, so bear with me. I started with an undergrad in computer science and physics,

13
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:24,000
then moved to a master's in physics, where I studied soft materials using computational

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,880
techniques. I then moved to, so that was in Israel where I grew up and then I moved to Switzerland

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,120
for PhD in material science, where I started applying some of these computational techniques

16
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:43,680
to biological materials. Usually small things like proteins and how they fold or how they interact

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,800
with each other to be the larger complexes. And then for the postdoc, I made a switch,

18
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:57,520
so first of all, I moved to the US. I spent time in a few departments first in chemistry,

19
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,560
and then in applied math, so you get my drift on all over the place.

20
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:10,640
And I made a big conceptual switch to study materials that are on the larger scale, on the level

21
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,280
of a super organism, instead of small proteins, because I was really interested in animal behavior,

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,520
and it was a really nice segue into that. And after that, I landed in Colorado,

23
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,000
where I am today. I'm officially in the computer science department, and I have a joint

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,760
appointment with the Bio Frontiers Institute, which is a very interdisciplinary institute,

25
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,360
bringing people from many departments to study problems in biology. And I'm also associated with

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:47,600
the Santa Fe Institute for complex systems. So it's a nice spot to be for people with background,

27
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:54,240
like mine, where we apply lots of different disciplines to understand problems in biology.

28
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,680
And naturally, since I'm in the computer science department, and we use a lot of computer science,

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,720
we also use a lot of machine learning techniques for analyzing our experimental data,

30
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:13,280
classifying behavior, and also in the simulation and agent-based models that we're using as coupled

31
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,840
technique to understand animal behavior. Okay, okay. You said something interesting in there.

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:27,440
You kind of characterize your work now, or your work with kind of systems of animals as large-scale

33
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:35,200
materials. Can you elaborate on that a little bit? Yeah, so I'm specifically referring to

34
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:43,440
honeybee swarms in one particular phenomenon that they or behavior they exhibit is that many,

35
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,680
many bees, tens of thousands of bees, connect their bodies by holding hands or legs or whatever they

36
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,160
can. And they create these really, really large materials that are completely made of honeybees,

37
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,960
and they're extremely adaptable. They can suspend themselves from tree branches or rooftops,

38
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:10,160
you know, lots of different surfaces. And that was then, I guess, an analogy for

39
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:17,360
or a microscopic manifestation of biological material. Yeah, interesting. You have been fascinated

40
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:25,440
by this whole idea of swarming behaviors for a while. I was initially introduced to it in the

41
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:33,280
context of trying to emulate swarming behaviors that occur naturally in distributed computing systems.

42
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,720
And this idea that you can take kind of the, you know, a set of simple primitives or rules

43
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,080
and have each system or each participant in a larger system kind of implement these simple

44
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,840
primitives without any knowledge of what anyone else is doing. And then you have these kind of

45
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:59,520
emergent behaviors across the broader system. It's super fascinating stuff. How did you,

46
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,680
like, what was what was kind of your entryway into thinking about these broader problems,

47
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,440
these kind of systems? So, first of all, yes, I can very much relate to that connection to

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,840
distributed algorithms and distributed hardware and swarm robotics, although we don't work on

49
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,760
it specifically in my lab, I think that we have so much to learn from nature, from swarms that

50
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,840
had a privilege of eons of evolution to perfect some of these collective communications. I find

51
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,760
it fascinating. And I guess I kind of expanded, you know, I started with the honey bee swarms materials

52
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,400
that I just mentioned. But there are just so many interesting things that the bees do, which we

53
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,600
observed while performing experiments on on the honey bee swarms. For example, they use chemical

54
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:57,920
communication where one bee produces a chemical signal, but because it's so it's very volatile,

55
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,520
it can decay very rapidly in time and space. So, other bees actually serve as signal amplifiers.

56
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,320
They stop at a certain distance and they generate a signal and then another bee does this and

57
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,920
another bee so they can transmit the signal over larger distances. I almost sounds like spiking

58
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:21,280
neurons. I think there's a deep relation to neurons and their synchronization or activities.

59
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:30,640
Absolutely. Yeah, so when I opened up my own lab at CU Boulder, I sort of, you know, took

60
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:38,080
some time to think what would be cool new ideas and new systems to study. And yeah, the honey bees

61
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,240
was a kind of natural because I was already working on it, but the fireflies is another

62
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:50,400
beautiful example of collective synchronization in nature where individuals flash on off.

63
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,040
And it's probably as close as it gets to computer language in the natural animal communication

64
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:04,560
in nature because it's such a simple signal. It's very similar to Morse code. So I saw some

65
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,320
had intuition and gut feeling that these would be cool systems to focus on.

66
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,640
Awesome. Awesome. And let's dig into that a bit more deeply. You presented on that at this past

67
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:23,200
CVPR, some of your research in that area and the ways that you use machine learning in your research.

68
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:30,240
Let's maybe start by having you expand a bit on the phenomenon that you were observing and

69
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,200
trying to characterize and then we'll get into the way you apply ML to help with that. Okay, sounds

70
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:41,440
good. So I'll start with maybe a bit of a broader background about fireflies since not everybody's

71
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:50,080
familiar with this. So fireflies are are beetles and they have an organ in the abdomen that is called

72
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,720
the lantern. So it can produce light. It's called light. It's based on chemical reaction.

73
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,040
And they use that lantern in order to communicate with each other. Usually it's in the context

74
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:08,320
of mating swarms. So that happens once a year where lots of fireflies congregate at a certain

75
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:16,480
area and then males would advertise themselves by producing a flash pattern. So a certain sequence

76
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:23,520
of flashes on and off. And then if a female perceives that signal and likes it and there's lots

77
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,280
of different ways to understand what what a female likes. She would respond also in a species

78
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:36,960
specific pattern. So these patterns the important issue about them is that they're species specific.

79
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,480
Each species and there's thousands of species of fireflies has its own unique flash pattern.

80
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,880
Can you imagine that if there is let's say one firefly in in in an area if you're just observing

81
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,520
one firefly then it's pretty easy to connect the dots. So you know that there's one firefly here

82
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,840
every time you see a flash that came from that one individual. So you can easily connect the dots

83
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,320
and kind of construct the flash pattern that is individual performed. But as soon as you have

84
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,680
more fireflies and you cannot see them when they're not flashing this becomes a really hard problem.

85
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,120
How do you connect the dots? How do you know which flash came from which individual?

86
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,240
In a sense it's similar to the cocktail party problem that it's a classical problem studied

87
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:31,840
in neuroscience where the idea is that you're present in a loud wrong with many people but humans

88
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:38,400
are really good at focusing on the person that they're speaking to and seems like fireflies are

89
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:44,080
somehow able to do it as well but we don't really understand how they do that. So we do know that

90
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:51,200
there's two main groups of fireflies species. There's fireflies who synchronize their flashes

91
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,240
and then naturally that increases the signal to noise ratio of the collective swarm and there's

92
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:02,480
fireflies who don't synchronize their flashes. So my lab studies both groups for the synchronous

93
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,240
fireflies the species that we started working with a couple of years ago. We try to understand

94
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:17,360
how they synchronize their flashes. So it's actually a non-phenomena. People have been

95
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,560
knew that fireflies can synchronize their flashes for a long time but it was kind of dismissed at

96
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:33,280
first as maybe people were just imagining it. Maybe the observers blinking somehow makes it

97
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:39,040
you know when they perceive it makes it look like the fireflies are flashing in unison. Maybe the

98
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:48,800
boat so it was in particular the first synchronous species were observed in Thailand on mangrove

99
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,880
trees on the banks of a river so people were on boats or some another potential hypothesis was

100
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,920
that the movement of the boat is maybe changing something about the perceived signal. But no it's

101
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,600
after several decades of rigorous studies turns out the fireflies do synchronize their flash

102
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:17,360
patterns and there has been lots of mathematical models to explain how this synchronization might occur

103
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,480
but very little quantitative experimental data to actually validate these models and that's the gap

104
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:33,200
that me and my lab members were after. Got it, got it. Before we dig into that kind of returning to

105
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:42,560
the thousand or thousands of species of fireflies it is the species distribution highly geographical

106
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,240
or is it the case when I'm walking down the street in July and see fireflies I'm observing

107
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,200
many different species at work. The information about the geographical distribution is a little

108
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,840
bit sparse at the moment. Fireflies have been very understudied relative to other insects but it

109
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:10,640
is known that some of the species of fireflies do coexist. So it's not that uncommon to walk

110
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:17,200
down the street or maybe in forest and actually observe swarms that contain two species of

111
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,120
fireflies. And then the problem of course becomes even more interesting because we can have synchronous

112
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:31,360
species and non-synchronous species overlapping and I'm really fascinated by how the females are

113
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:38,640
able to interpret those signals and detect their own species. Kind of getting into the experimental

114
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,800
part of your work kind of how do you set up those experiments and I'm imagining that's going to

115
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:52,560
lead us to the role of computer vision. Yes exactly exactly so I imagine that until a few years ago

116
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:59,680
there wasn't sufficient quantitative data to validate the models and we wanted to acquire that kind

117
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:07,040
of data. And nowadays actually with very simple cameras, goal pros, sometimes even with our smartphones

118
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,600
we can capture the very dim light of the fireflies. It wasn't the case always so I think that's one of

119
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,320
the reasons it hasn't been it has been a bit understudied. And so what we do is we go to the field

120
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:27,280
with cameras so it's kind of an unusual experience for computer science professors,

121
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,600
PhD students and postdocs we all go together to the field which is really exciting so we get to

122
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:42,480
see the fireflies and we record their flashes. Now in some of the mathematical models that I mentioned

123
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:51,440
before the concept is that there's some kind of coupling between each agent whether that's a

124
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:59,600
firefly, a person, a heart cell or actually even electrons in a in a superconductor.

125
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,560
There are somehow coupled to their neighbors that coupling can decay as a function of distance

126
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,040
between the two agents which makes sense if you think about fireflies maybe as they get further

127
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,200
and further away from each other the you know the light is dimmer and dimmer and they cannot see

128
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:23,200
each other very well. So space is really important we really want to capture where and when the fireflies

129
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:32,720
flash and to capture the spatial aspect we need stereo vision. So we have two cameras and that

130
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:41,120
kind of works like our own depth estimation as humans we have two eyes so we can capture

131
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,920
you know the same objects from two different views and from that triangulate how far away that

132
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:56,160
object is. So we do the same thing with fireflies and stereo vision has been very well used so

133
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:04,720
there's actually code to to interpret these kind of data but we extended that method a little bit

134
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,440
to eliminate camera calibration. Camera calibration is one of the most annoying things in stereo

135
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,400
recording you have to go especially when in the field you have to calibrate the cameras both

136
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:24,720
temporarily so make sure that the same frame from each camera view is synchronized as well as

137
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:32,320
spatially so you need to know the exact relative positions of the camera and what we what we did

138
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:39,040
is we could only do this because the firefly flashes are so bright in comparison to the background

139
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:46,560
we actually use the firefly flashes to calibrate our cameras so we apply some basic computer vision

140
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:54,000
we threshold the image to find where the flashes are in both camera views and then to we solve the

141
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:00,960
alignment and calibration as an optimization problem so we find out for example how many flashes

142
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:06,160
were recorded from each camera view and you plot that as a function of time and then we align

143
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,440
this information from both cameras until they match so it's so it's incense an optimization

144
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,960
problem where the output is what was the temporal difference between the two cameras.

145
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:26,000
And do the cameras always have the exact same field of view or do you also have to account for

146
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,720
kind of overlapping but not perfectly aligned field of view. Exactly they're not perfectly aligned

147
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:39,360
so but we use the fraction of the field of view where they do align so that's a good point and

148
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,840
we have to account for that yes. And so in terms of the optimization problem are you using

149
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:53,360
any particular algorithms to do that or? Yeah so we're using some well-known

150
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,400
I guess optimization code some of the codes we usually depending on how many parameters we need

151
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:05,520
to optimize for the temporal aspect it's we just want parameter which is the time difference

152
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:12,880
between the camera for the spatial arrangement there's actually more parameters because each

153
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:21,360
camera has a three-dimensional position in space X, Y, Z and actually it's represented by a three-by-three

154
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:28,560
matrix so we have enough parameter to start worrying about using more efficient optimization code so

155
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:37,840
we we use a lot in the lab a method called CMAES covariance matrix adaptation evolutionary

156
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,200
strategy that's a little extension of that and it's actually really cool because it's based on

157
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:51,680
biological evolution and it's calculating the covariance matrix that each parameter set is

158
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:59,760
giving you and making sure that covariance matrix is large so when the covariance matrix is large

159
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:07,440
it means that you're more exposed to different landscapes on the function that you're trying to

160
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,480
optimize and less likely to get stuck in local equilibrium and more likely to get towards the

161
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,840
global equilibrium that's just one example and there's a few other methods that we use and

162
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,640
we haven't invented them they're really just out of the box methods that people use for solving

163
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,720
optimization problems. Got it and where does the evolutionary aspect of that come in to play?

164
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,200
There is in each generation of the optimization code or optimization function there is basically

165
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:48,080
a for loop and there's a certain number of points on the landscape. Each point corresponds to one

166
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:57,280
parameter set and these points we kind of keep keep count whether they helped increase the area

167
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:02,720
of the covariance matrix or decrease it. If they helped increase it then they're more likely to

168
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,640
survive the next generation and that's where the evolutionary aspect comes to play. There is a

169
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:15,440
fitness function to the points on the energy landscape in a sense. Interesting, interesting and

170
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:22,320
on the temporal side is it you're doing some kind of like sliding window kind of thing or you're

171
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,920
trying to see where and so once you have that aspect of machine learning is just helping you kind

172
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:34,240
of set up your experiment and know where your cameras are and get them all aligned. Do you use

173
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,560
machine learning further along in the research or the experimentation process? So that's the main

174
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:45,520
aspect for the data acquisition and I will just I just want to point out that we don't do it only

175
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:52,800
for ourselves. We are actually hoping to really extend the data acquisition and there's an

176
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,920
ongoing increasing attention to five light behavior. So we hope to be able to actually crowdsource

177
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:03,440
data acquisition and for that eliminating the calibration process is really crucial.

178
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,920
Oh wow. So allowing someone to just download this onto a couple of phones and

179
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:13,040
put them on a tripod or something and start to collect data. That's what we hope to do and

180
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,840
actually this year we have an amazing group of scientists and just far fly enthusiasts,

181
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,560
enthusiastic people who are volunteering to help us collect data and we're testing that method.

182
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:35,600
And is the these alignment steps that we're talking about? Is that a post processing step or

183
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,800
are you trying to do some kind of real-time alignment? So it's actually a post processing step

184
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:46,320
although in post processing it can also be aligned along different windows of the recording

185
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,240
which means that anybody who has a pair of cameras can potentially just record and then send us

186
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,720
the data and we can do everything in post processing. So there is no you don't need anything else

187
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,800
besides cameras and and tripods. Talk a little bit about what you do with the the aligned data

188
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:14,800
once you have it. Okay so the once we have the aligned data there's two main ways that we use it.

189
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,120
One is to understand far fly behavior, how they're synchronizing their flashes for example

190
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,640
and I can talk more about that and I'll just mention the other the other way that we use it is for

191
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:35,120
population monitoring. So as I mentioned each species of far fly has different flash patterns

192
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:40,400
so just by using this recording and tracking the far flies in three dimensions we can reconstruct

193
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:46,720
what was the flash pattern and from there we can identify the species of the far fly using again

194
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,000
machine learning techniques. And that's important for far fly conservation which is has been

195
00:21:53,040 --> 00:22:01,440
generally neglected until a few years ago and and turns out that far flies do suffer from

196
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:09,680
population decline due to climate change and due to light pollution. So there's an increasing

197
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:14,720
amount of programs that are trying to objectively characterize the far fly populations.

198
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,080
Right now the the way that people measure far fly populations or quantify them is kind of by

199
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,160
eye so they go out to the field and try to count how many flashes they they see in which species

200
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,560
but that's really hard to do once you have lots of individuals in the same spot so we hope that our

201
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,960
more passive way to record far flies is is going to help there.

202
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:51,840
Exactly it's hard for them to make when the lights are on in a sense they can find each other

203
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:59,840
they directly changes the contrast between the far fly flashes and the background and they

204
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:07,520
definitely flash less when when it's bright outside. So in your description of the ways that the

205
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:13,760
things that you're doing with the data you mentioned identifying the synchronization patterns

206
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,800
identifying the individual far flies I guess in a frame or in a video and kind of tracking their

207
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:26,800
movement through the frame it sounds like there are a bunch of potential ML applications and all

208
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:32,560
that to use machine learning for those areas as well or more traditional methods. At the moment we're

209
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:40,720
using more traditional methods like thresholding and filling out you know little holes in the in the

210
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:48,000
flash of the pattern these kind of things but it doesn't always work of course because if you're

211
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,240
doing classical motion detection but there's little things that move in the background like maybe

212
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,880
there's a tree and there's a little bit of wind so the leaves are moving that can really mess up

213
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,760
with these classical methods so our next step is actually to use more advanced machine learning

214
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,560
techniques to track the far flies which has been done a lot with insect swarms we did it with other

215
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:22,160
insect swarms like carnivies it seems like it's a possible possible approach and we haven't done

216
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,360
it yet but we hope to do it as the next step and I'm imagining that kind of collecting and

217
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:34,080
labeling curating a data set is one of the big challenges to overcome in order to make it all work

218
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:41,360
that's always a challenge so yeah preparing the training set basically is always the maybe the most

219
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,760
time-consuming thing so you mentioned honeybees again talk a little bit more about what you're

220
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:56,800
looking at when you're studying honeybees okay so honeybees totally different animal let me

221
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,560
just give you a very brief background so honeybees living very very large are usually congested

222
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:14,800
colonies there is one queen and most of the the rest of the bees are female workers there's maybe 10%

223
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:23,040
drone males and the numbers we're talking about is tens of thousands or you know even more sometimes

224
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,720
for a particular colony so it's really really large and the the communication there is extremely

225
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,240
distributed is you know there's a queen but the queen doesn't really tell them what to do they make

226
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,840
a lot of decision based on local information that they sense around them either from neighboring

227
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,480
bees or from the environment and they make decisions based on that and somehow there's a lot of

228
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:53,360
interesting emergence behavior emerging behavior in how they for example ventilator hive how they

229
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,360
maintain mechanical stability as a swarm these are the swarm the materials made of bees that I

230
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:07,680
mentioned before and they do a lot of interesting things as a collective as a coherent aggregated

231
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:14,480
group but one thing we were interested in was how do they become a coherent group in the first

232
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,880
place we know that bees can sense the pheromones of the queen pheromones are chemical signals that

233
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:27,440
they're very volatile they they cave very rapidly in time and space so bees that are close to the

234
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,120
queen maybe have no problem to sense these signals but bees that are further away are going to

235
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,840
struggle so that that was one of the problems the first problems we started working on when I

236
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:45,440
opened my lab how do bees that are further away our pheromones modulated at a frequency

237
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:55,440
kind of fast enough for communication I kind of think of them as a much longer kind of wavelength

238
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:04,000
signal so it really depends on the the half-life time of that chemical signal I think you write that

239
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,040
usually it's more it's less instantaneous than a far-fly flash for example and it's sometimes

240
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:16,880
it's passive so it's just you know the queen for example has lots of pheromones glands on her body

241
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,080
she doesn't really do anything active in order to transmit these pheromones it just kind of diffuse

242
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,960
passively from from her body so I think these are the two main differences

243
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:34,400
okay so how do bees that are further away from the queen are able to find her of course the queen

244
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,880
is really important because there's only one queen she's the only fertile bee actually that can

245
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:49,440
lay eggs and help the colony maintain its colony size so it turns out that bees can serve as

246
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:56,240
little signal amplifiers and they do something that in the beekeeping jargon is called

247
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:04,720
sending so they stick their abdomen upwards and they open up a pheromone gland by applying this

248
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:12,240
body posture and they fender wings so the airflow draws air across this pheromone gland and they

249
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,560
depending on how their body is oriented in which direction that also determines the direction

250
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:23,840
in which the signal is going to propagate so it basically propagates from their head backwards

251
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,840
and we found out doing some preliminary experiments that bees use that sent in behavior to

252
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,240
inform bees that are further away from the queen so there are like little Wi-Fi extenders

253
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:43,600
exactly exactly it's like a little telecommunication network where the bees a bee that senses the

254
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:48,960
pheromones of the queen would stop at a particular distance start sending further away from the queen

255
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,760
towards the less informed bees and then another bee would come from behind to do the same thing

256
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,840
and the same thing and the same thing so they create this really interesting dynamical network of

257
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:06,480
communication that is extremely robust and adjustable also to environmental perturbation so

258
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:12,480
I think it's a fascinating behavior that the bees kind of managed to do and we wanted to

259
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,480
understand that a little bit better and that's where machine learning came into into the play so

260
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,920
we wanted a way to classify the behavior of the bees in a high throughput way I mean we can see

261
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,800
by eye that they're sending but as you just mentioned creating these training sets and

262
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,800
marking the bees when they're sending that can take a very very long time just to give you

263
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:44,080
the sense for one experiment we spend months basically cataloging and classifying the behavior

264
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:52,000
of the bees that are sending so to overcome that we use machine learning where the training set was

265
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:01,200
a collection of either snapshots or movies of bees that are performing sending or not performing

266
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:09,040
sending and the output is yes or not or no are these bees sending producing the signal or not

267
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:15,120
and also in which direction they're sending and these are the two important aspects of that

268
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,280
behavior that we can then use to better understand why the bees are sending how they make decisions

269
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:30,320
about sending in which direction they usually send and when we when we ran the experiments and

270
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:37,040
the analysis with the machine learning classification of the behavior we noticed that indeed the bees

271
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:43,360
the rest of the worker bees create a global map to where the queen is so they all sent in a

272
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:51,920
direction that if you follow all the sending events you would end up where the queen is and we

273
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:57,280
think that what happens is that they do so so that the further away bees the less informed ones

274
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,000
can follow these signals to find the queen gives another meaning to gradient descent

275
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:14,800
there's endless funds you can use with the bees actually interesting and so how do you use

276
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,480
the kind of the understanding that you gained around this network and the directionality of

277
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:29,520
the sending behavior yeah so finding out whether that information is indeed leading to the queen

278
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,800
all the sending direction that was the first step that was kind of a proof of concept that we found

279
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:42,720
an interesting communication signal that really has a meaning and in that case it's the global

280
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:50,000
position of where the queen is now we can actually dive deeper we can ask things like

281
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:55,360
how do bees make decisions how does it be decide oh now I'm going to stop and I'm going to

282
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:03,600
stand backwards or now I'm just going to follow the signal of the other bees and from that we noticed

283
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:09,360
a few interesting hints from the experiments we noticed that bees that are sending

284
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,720
position themselves at a very particular distance from other bees that are sending and we can

285
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,240
only do that because we have this you know big data set with the machine learning high throughput

286
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:30,000
analysis so since we're dealing with a chemical signal that diffuses or has some kind of advection

287
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,120
a particular distance from a source would imply a particular concentration particular

288
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,360
concentration of that signal from the source if you just think about the classical physical

289
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,960
equations of diffusion for example so that's really interesting maybe it means that the bees get

290
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,720
triggered by a threshold of concentration of the pheromone so if the threshold is above a certain

291
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,240
threshold sorry if the concentration is above a certain threshold then they start triggering

292
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,320
their behavior their sending behavior another thing we notice is that this there's a little bit of

293
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:09,680
estochasticity to that process so there is the bees have certain probability once they sense that

294
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:16,720
chemical chemical concentration above a threshold then you know maybe 50% of the time they stop

295
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:24,880
sending and 50% of the time they ignore it and then what we did is take these hints from the

296
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,400
experiments and we actually plug them into an agent-based model that mimics what the bees do

297
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:38,400
and we actually again used optimization strategies or machine learning to explore the parameters

298
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:47,600
base in the agent-based model to find optimalities of the process interesting interesting going

299
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:56,880
back to the kind of characterizing the pheromone is there is there just is there one pheromone or

300
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:04,080
is pheromone kind of a family of chemicals in there are I'm trying to get a sense for the granularity

301
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,520
of pheromones as a communication vehicle yeah it's it's actually a fascinating fascinating field

302
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:14,800
I'll you know to lower your expectation I would say we don't really know we know that there's

303
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,160
definitely more than one pheromone and the granularity of different pheromones pheromone is kind of

304
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:24,240
like a cocktail of different chemicals and so it can you can have different concentrations of

305
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,560
these chemicals different bees within a colony can have different pheromones sometimes it depends

306
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:36,960
on their age bees from different colonies would have a different combination of chemicals

307
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,280
that lead to their pheromones this is how they distinguish between nest mates and non-nest

308
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:50,240
mates and it's a fascinating of action in animal communication is a fascinating topic that

309
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:57,120
I think it's really not clear what is the right level of granularity in bees but also in other

310
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:04,160
species so in your research do you ultimately think of it as kind of a binary signal you know

311
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:11,920
with maybe some with regard to some threshold the bees either you know propagating pheromones

312
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,960
or not exactly you're not trying to get to a low you're not trying to get to a lower low

313
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,200
no we for simplicity we're starting as a yeah as you said a zero or one are they are they

314
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:30,640
producing chemical signals or not in the future if it ever becomes possible to actually measure

315
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,960
the chemical concentration of these pheromones I think it would be really interesting to try to

316
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:39,760
further classify and dig deeper whether different bees have slightly different

317
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:46,640
combination of chemicals and how they affect the yeah the behavior of the rest of this one

318
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:51,360
earlier you mentioned that you were talking about the difficulty of data collection

319
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:58,240
in this case as well and you mentioned that you overcame you it sounded like you were saying

320
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:07,520
you overcame that by doing some some data collection and some classification I wanted to make

321
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,760
sure that I understood specifically what you're doing were you kind of like bootstrapping

322
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:23,040
a broader you know something that was able to operate on large scale by doing creating a small

323
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:30,880
scale classifier like some kind of hierarchical thing oh no no not that advanced what we did

324
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:38,960
is we basically prepared a training set so we had a set of movies or snapshots of bees that are

325
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:46,560
sending or not sending that those were hand labeled and also the body orientation was hand labeled

326
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:55,680
and then we train either a CNN or an RNN on on this data in order to get the output which is

327
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:03,680
yes no is this be sending or not or and if yes in which direction it is propagating the information

328
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:12,480
to got it got it and then you you're applying that kind of frame by frame on this these images

329
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:19,600
that you capture and are you creating like some kind of you know at each for each be like a point

330
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:25,680
vector of like if they're sending in what direction that kind of thing exactly and then what we do

331
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,560
is integrate we take all these vectors and we construct a higher dimensional surface from the

332
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,840
vectors are kind of gradients we use them we treat them as gradients we reconstruct the surface

333
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,960
so then high values on that surface should correspond to where the target is in this case it's where

334
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:50,560
the queen is in terms of kind of next steps for both the the fireflies and the honey bees and any

335
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:58,320
other species that you're investigating are there things that you're seeing kind of coming down

336
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:06,960
the pike in the you know or kind of already established in the machine learning world that you

337
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,640
you know think are promising for your research and are looking forward to applying?

338
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,000
Yeah so one thing we already kind of talked about briefly was applying more sophisticated

339
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:23,120
machine learning computer vision tools for a firefly behavior I think that that's absolutely

340
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:28,960
necessary and I think it would help us a lot to get rid of environmental noise and capture more

341
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:36,160
flashes we might also be able to capture something interesting about the movement of the firefly so

342
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,040
I only mentioned temporal information but the fireflies are actually moving and when they're moving

343
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,920
they're almost like drawing you know a line particular particular shape with with their flashes

344
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,400
so we're really wondering if there's any further information encoded in in the movement as well

345
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:02,640
and we're hoping to extend our both tracking and also species classification based on that

346
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,920
in the movement as well and that wouldn't be unheard of don't bees have like communicate via

347
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,160
movement patterns or something like that I think I remember reading them yeah yeah very true

348
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:18,320
so the bees use the waggle dance to inform other bees about a target that is usually further away

349
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:25,120
so they use the sensing for things that are within a few meters beyond that they're actually

350
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:30,960
using the waggle dance that is a slightly you know it has slightly different accuracy but it's

351
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:39,200
fine or for long distances and the waggle dance basically tells the bees that can perceive that

352
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:47,440
signal where is a good source of food or in a site how far it is and in which direction they should fly

353
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,640
yeah so you know there's there's actually lots of different communication signals in bees

354
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,320
it can be characterized with machine learning computer vision tools like the waggle dance

355
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:06,160
maybe there's auditory signals that they use and actually people keep finding more and more

356
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:14,080
new communication signals that the bees use usually they're based on just a person kind of

357
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,360
staring at what the bees are doing and then notice some patterns but actually using machine learning

358
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:28,000
tools can be a really powerful ways to more subjectively find some interesting new communication

359
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:36,080
methods or signals that the bees use and that to me suggests kind of unsupervised type of an approach

360
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,560
or clustering approaches that's something that you've experimented with yeah I'm definitely

361
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:48,560
familiar with the methods we haven't tried it on the bee communication or experiments that we

362
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,280
work with in my lab but I think it could be really promising future direction yeah all right well

363
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,880
all right thanks so much for taking the time to share what you've been working on and the way you're

364
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,600
applying machine learning to study communication and insect super fascinating stuff thank you so much

365
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:32,320
it was fun chatting with you and thanks again for having me
