00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
All right, everyone. Welcome to another episode of the Twomol AI podcast. I'm your host, Sam

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,720
Sherrington. Today, I'm joined by Catherine Nakalembe. Catherine is associate research professor

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:16,960
at the University of Maryland and Africa program director under NASA Harvest. Before we get into

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,520
today's conversation, be sure to take a moment to head over to Apple Podcasts, Spotify,

5
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,640
or your listening platform of choice. And if you enjoy the show, leave us a five-star rating

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,040
in review. Catherine, welcome to the podcast. Thank you. I'm glad to be here.

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:38,080
I'm super excited to speak with you and learn more about what you're up to. You recently presented

8
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:46,640
on your work at the machine learning and the physical sciences workshop at this recent Nureps conference.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,480
And your presentation was on supporting food security in Africa using machine learning and

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,400
earth observations. And we're going to dig deep into that topic. But before we do, I'd love to

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,760
have you share a little bit about your background and how you came to work in machine learning.

12
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,720
My background is in agriculture and my sensing research. So, you know, before machine learning

13
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:18,240
was such a big component of the work that we do, I focused on agriculture land use and drop

14
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,600
monitoring using existing satellite data sets. And, you know, throughout my PhD, my focus was in

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,920
in Africa. So, I've worked in Tanzania and you've gone very in Kenya and in Mali among other

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:40,160
countries. And, you know, outside of just understanding how agriculture and food security systems

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:48,000
work, I wanted to really figure out a way of utilizing earth observations in the process. And so,

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,440
I learned a lot of things including, you know, many complexities around, you know, accessibility

19
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,480
and utilization, as well as some of the limitations in terms of the data sets or the tools that

20
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:03,680
were available specifically. When you start looking in, you know, small older agriculture, which

21
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,520
is a dominant type of agriculture in South China and Africa. And so, in that process, you know,

22
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,800
it became pretty obvious that in order to improve the monitoring and utility of these data sets,

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,840
we have to improve the methods. And in the last couple of years, you know, there's been a huge

24
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,800
boost in expansion in terms of integration of machine learning methods to take advantage of

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,040
the existing data sets. And so, we're sort of in this era where we are able to process a lot more

26
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,960
data and use much smarter or faster tools to do that. And, this is, of course, complemented by

27
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,040
the fact that there's an explosion in terms of data sets, which means, you know, you need to be

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,960
able to process a lot more, a lot more data sets in that sense. This means that we're able to

29
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,600
look at places that were not looked at the same way. So, we have much higher frequency in terms of

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:04,800
observations, which in addition to higher resolution data. And so, being able to utilize those data sets

31
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,760
and get insights in a, you know, quicker way requires that we use machine learning. Otherwise,

32
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,320
you know, to be able to download and analyze data that way we did last couple of years,

33
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,400
it would not be possible, would still be, you know, snail speed. So, it's a pretty exciting,

34
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,200
kind of prerequisite to work in this space right now, to be able to apply newer tools

35
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,720
to, you know, develop the best possible. Sounds like it's a transition that's happening

36
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,840
pretty quickly in the space, as opposed to, you know, something gradual over the past 10 years.

37
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,160
So, you know, prior to, I'd say from my own personal work that I kind of worked on,

38
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:52,160
primarily we use decision trees, random forests for a lot of the analysis that we did.

39
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:59,120
And in addition to the fact that remote sensing data sets add big data by default. So,

40
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,480
looking at thousands and thousands of pixels over really, really large areas,

41
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,320
it meant that very few groups could work on these types of data sets. So, to analyze data for

42
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:15,600
a small region, it could be just a county in the past, you know, you need to be able one to

43
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:22,000
download it. You need to have an HPC or, you know, a decent server in order to be able to analyze it.

44
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,040
And so, when I did my PhD at Maryland, I was in one of those departments where this was possible,

45
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,760
you know, so it was like I was on the leading edge. But in the last couple of years, you know,

46
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:37,360
with cloud computing becoming, you know, more accessible, many, many, many, many more people

47
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,720
are able to do this. And so, what that means is, if you think about expanding access and utility

48
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:50,080
means many more eyes, many more questions of being asked, being asked very different way.

49
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,120
And so, what that means is that there's a lot more innovation, there's a lot more creativity,

50
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,360
there's a span in research questions that would not be possible at all in the past. And so,

51
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,200
that's why it's, you know, it's incredibly, it's incredibly changing. So, you find that,

52
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,840
you know, looking at flooding might not be important to somebody who lives, I'm trying to think

53
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,280
about a place where it's not experience any flooding. But if a person, let's say, who lives in,

54
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,640
you know, a small city that is constantly flooded, that might be a critical question that they want

55
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,720
to answer, right? And so, if they didn't have the lab or the computing cluster to be able to do it,

56
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,800
they will never, they will never do it. But now, the way things stand, there are all these

57
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,920
online platforms that allow you to access and analyze data for your own area, for

58
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:43,360
where you want to look. And that makes it really interesting, in that sense. So, that's why it's

59
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:50,160
changing many, many, many, many, many more eyes, looking at something, you know, equals creativity,

60
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,320
explosion, creativity ideas and things that are being explored. Awesome, awesome. In addition to your

61
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,640
faculty post, I mentioned that you're the Africa program director at NASA Harvest. Can you talk a

62
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:07,440
little bit about NASA Harvest and what it is, what it's hoping to achieve? Havas studied in 2017,

63
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:15,440
it is NASA's and NASA's Agriculture and Food Security Program. The idea is, over the years,

64
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,200
NASA has invested a lot of money in terms of not only missions collecting data, but, you know,

65
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,400
of the surface of the earth, as well as, you know, looking out the space, among other things.

66
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:32,800
And they've invested a lot of money in terms of research. And so, research around land,

67
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,920
use and land cover change, analyses, research around water resources, understanding where our

68
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:42,400
water is, what health that water is. And with these investments means there's, you know,

69
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,040
an explosion also in terms of solutions, but a lot of these remain in research. And so,

70
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:55,440
there are a few programs that are working under what is called the Applied Sciences Program.

71
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,760
So, this, the Havas program falls under the Applied Sciences Program. And the idea of the

72
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:04,640
Applied Sciences Program is that there is research that's being done and it can be at several

73
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:10,480
levels of maturity. And, you know, the highest level of maturity means that the outcome of this

74
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,400
particular research equals, you know, influencing or impacting on a decision. And so Havas is

75
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,280
one that is focused on supporting decision making and agriculture through the utilization of

76
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,240
remote sensing. And so, if you think about somebody doing an experimental field,

77
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:35,040
field research to understand how Maze grows and how you can, you know, increase your productivity,

78
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,880
that could just be purely a research paper, right? But then getting from that research to be

79
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,920
able to monitor it over a really large area, that is another level of maturity. So, you monitor

80
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:53,680
over a large area, maybe you monitor it over a long time. But then maybe the Department of Agriculture

81
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,840
decides, well, this information is telling us this particular region is not performing well for,

82
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,280
you know, the reasons A, B, C, D. And so, we need to, you know, develop a policy to address this

83
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,760
concerns in that particular region. And so, that research would have matured. So, from just a

84
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:15,520
field experiment, to a large scale monitoring, to then influencing what the Department of Agriculture

85
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:22,560
might do. And so, Havas is basically at that space to see as much research maturity at that level.

86
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,880
But it's also a user-driven initiative in the sense that there is a use case in mind. And so,

87
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:36,000
there have been lots of experimental small scale studies that show the possibilities of things

88
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,360
that you can understand and do better with remote sensing. But not that many examples of them

89
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:48,240
being used in decision making. And so, we're working in that space to move things, you know,

90
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,160
things further ahead in that sense. And we're trying to do it at a global scale.

91
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,960
Get them in hands of the folks that might be able to use them.

92
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,520
Exactly. And I mean, the other advantage, of course, is that the fact that with satellite data,

93
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:05,360
we have this kind of snoptic view, you can use the same satellite data over really, really large areas,

94
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,640
over long-term. And so, in places where action is or is, you know, after the fact,

95
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,040
so if there was a huge flooding event, response is typically, you know, to help people get out of

96
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,480
risky areas. This potential that, you know, you could forecast that a little bit earlier. But then

97
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,880
figuring out how to get the knowledge of the forecast into the hands of people who will be

98
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:35,520
impacted is a whole other dimension. And so, trying to figure out how to narrow that gap from

99
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,280
data to decision is, you know, something that is really important is not something that's not

100
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:47,040
really easy to do. And that's what Havas is trying to do. Can you help us take a step back and

101
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:58,000
kind of contextualize the broad challenge of food security, you know, the number of folks that

102
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,560
are impacted by it. And you've also, in your presentation, you shared recent events that have

103
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,960
catalyzed this need to be really careful, you know, even before COVID made, you know,

104
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,560
things difficult for everyone in terms of supply chains and things like that. Can you talk a little

105
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,240
bit about the problem broadly? You know, with food security in itself, I think not a lot of people

106
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,520
think about it. Even people who are, you know, experiencing it, you know, I think about it as a

107
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:33,680
food security. But what it, you know, in simple terms, it just means that you have food, you know,

108
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,400
you have people, you have food all the time. So, you not only have access to it, as in it is

109
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:46,240
available at your grocery store, but you have the income of the money to be able to acquire it.

110
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,720
And the other, you know, there, it has like these broad components around, so availability and

111
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:59,680
access. So availability, it being at the store or coming from my garden, and then access is,

112
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,120
can I reach that garden, or can I reach the market? That's, you know, another component,

113
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,200
in addition to, can I buy it? And then utilization is that, you know, the quality of the food in

114
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:19,280
itself. So there might be food, but it might be, you know, no vegetables, or things like that,

115
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,400
that are really critical for a healthy diet, right? Healthy nutritious diet. And then stability is,

116
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,840
is the other component, which means that food being available today, but not tomorrow or not

117
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,800
into weeks is not a stable security. And so, for security means all of those things and trying

118
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,960
to be sure that you can sustain those over long term. And then of course, there is, you know,

119
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,960
having a sustainable food system means that all of these components are addressed over the long term.

120
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,000
And so, then being addressed over the long term means that food would be available, accessible

121
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,480
and stable over really long term for community. And unfortunately, you know, we're not doing so

122
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,000
great in that space, in terms of global food security. And I think sometimes, you know,

123
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,920
it's portrayed as if it's, you know, in poor countries or, you know, lower-middle-income countries.

124
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,400
But it's a white problem, including in the United States, where people worry about food and where

125
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,440
your food will come from, you know, is one of the indicators of a food insecure household,

126
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,440
for example. And so, you know, the numbers that have been coming out of these food security

127
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,720
assessments, you know, quite alarming where we have an average, you know, between 2020, you know,

128
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:49,280
2020 until now, an average 828 million people without, you know, that food insecure. And because of

129
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:56,000
COVID, I think they estimated an additional, I think an additional 200 million people from between

130
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:03,200
29, 20, beginning of 2020 until now. And that's because COVID, in fact, is so many parts of our

131
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:10,320
food system. So it impacted food access, it impacted food production, people not being able to work,

132
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,080
and people not being able to, you know, things not being able to move at the pace that they used to

133
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,320
move before so food can be available at the market. And then, in addition to, you know, just the

134
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,120
basic fact that, you know, food is not accessible available and, you know, too many people, we have,

135
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,600
you know, the added context of the conflict between the Ukraine and Russia, where both countries

136
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,200
being huge contributors to global food security. So, you know, the largest producers for some of

137
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:46,400
the most critical crops, wheat, for example, maize, other many countries are actually really struggling

138
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,920
in the sense that if you think about a country like Egypt that imports, I think it was some 80 or

139
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:59,920
so percent of their grain from one or both of them, not having any wheat coming through for a long

140
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,480
time, that means that food prices in Egypt would skyrocket, which, you know, impact on what

141
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,360
people can eat. And of course, food systems are also very complex because they are also traditions

142
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:18,960
around them. So, you can just substitute, you know, a standard traditional food with, you know,

143
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:25,600
some other random things. So, you can replace, for example, bread typically made with wheat,

144
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,800
with bread made with corn, sometimes you actually cannot reproduce it, you know, if you know,

145
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,600
like a naan or a tapati, for example. So, you know, those things are incredibly complicated.

146
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:44,160
And then, so, outside of conflict, I'm just going to add, this is the last point I guess I'll add

147
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:51,360
is that there are all these events that are happening that, you know, for a lot of places until

148
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,440
the last couple of years, climate change has been something that's, you know, spoken about as

149
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,760
something that could happen in the future or something that, you know, might never impact on

150
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,760
communities. But if you look at, you know, the last couple of years, and if you look at a very

151
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,320
specific area, you might find that overlapping, sometimes overlapping, at the time sequential

152
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,200
events happen, that wipe out entire food systems and sometimes entire communities. So, you have

153
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:25,200
stream flooding events, you have things like locusts, you know, destroying crops, you have

154
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,520
things like landslides, you know, that not only damage people's property, take many lives,

155
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:41,520
but they also destroy food sources. I usually use this example in my presentations where there's

156
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:51,680
a cyclone that happened in 2019, cyclone I die. It was around March 2019. And it affected a lot

157
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,680
of countries in South Africa, cost so many lives, destroyed so much property. And while it was

158
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,760
happening, you know, in East Africa, which is a few kilometers north of where the cyclone hit,

159
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,440
you know, there were kind of had forecasts, it's fantastic, potentially good normal growing season.

160
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:17,760
But because of the cyclone, moisture got pulled out of East Africa into the cyclone and what ended

161
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,960
up, you know, what was projected to be a good start of season ended up being a failed season.

162
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,080
It was like crop failure in Kenya. And so, you have these extreme, extreme events happening,

163
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,760
you know, next to each other. So, if any of these countries dependent on each other for, you know,

164
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,880
multiple things, you can see that, you know, none of that would be possible. And so, it's

165
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,920
usually the poor of the poorest that are impacted. And so, it's really, really complicated. And I

166
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,000
think, I think, we've caught some particular one of those things that lead us to think that

167
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,280
we really have to think big, we really have to think wide, and we really have to think sustainably.

168
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,440
And, you know, things that seem so far away from us actually, not that far away.

169
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:04,880
The last example highlights the, as you mentioned, the complexity of these systems and all of the

170
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:14,000
the interconnections across countries and regions. There are also, I guess, many

171
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,320
players in the system. There are the consumers. There are the producers. There are stores. There

172
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:27,840
are, you know, the inputs to production. I get the impression that your research focuses on

173
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,960
two particular constituents, farmers and policy makers. Is that an accurate assessment?

174
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,320
And can you talk about, you know, why those two and how you decide where to focus?

175
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:45,920
My research, you know, is primarily trying to understand agriculture production.

176
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:53,360
And ultimately, hope that what I understand and learn could be utilized by policy makers. And so,

177
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,640
we focus on understanding where crops are growing, how they're growing, and what the

178
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,040
production might be. This is just like one of the things that inform food availability.

179
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:13,440
You know, and, you know, in the end, if you really want to understand that complexity of food security,

180
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,040
you would need to, you know, go beyond just that. And so, you would need to understand how market

181
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:25,040
function. If an extreme event happens, is there a potential thing that can address this? And

182
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:29,360
you being able to figure out how to quantify those things is really critical. In some places,

183
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,680
it's kind of, I mean, it's straight forward, not so straightforward, but much more straightforward.

184
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:40,000
So, if there is a flood, for example, in Maryland, right? And people's households wiped out,

185
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,360
you know, households have insurance. People might, if people have insurance, they might be,

186
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,200
you know, be put up somewhere for a couple of weeks until things come down. The, you know,

187
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,920
Maryland national, the Maryland might have a storage, you know, storage facility that they can

188
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,480
bring, you know, medical equipment, food, among other things to support people who were directly

189
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,760
impacted. In the case, for example, where that cyclone hit, this might not be possible at all.

190
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:12,080
And so, people have absolutely nothing. So, what you want to do is prevent people being

191
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:21,840
in that situation. So, we focus on trying to understand, you know, if you think about

192
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,960
forecasting early where a drought might happen, that could be really useful for if a government needs

193
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:34,480
to respond, to figure out where can they get food that can help support communities. You know,

194
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,320
you might want to think about things like infrastructure. So, it's, it's, it's, it's incredibly

195
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:46,080
complicated. And then for, for the farmers, really, they're a great source of knowledge about what's

196
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,360
actually really happening in a region. And even though we, sometimes I think we think that we know

197
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,440
better, we rarely do no better. We probably never know better, because they're in that situation where

198
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,280
they understand what is happening in their field and the best place person to kind of address it.

199
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,000
And so, what you want to do is just give them context. So, what is happening in a broader region,

200
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,600
what my, you know, what is being forecast and what that might mean. So, for example,

201
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,080
the low-cost invasion in East Africa, I think the UN had predicted that there would be an invasion

202
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,480
maybe, I'm going to say, eight, nine months actually early. The reason for this is, you know,

203
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,120
the locus habitat, the way locus lay their eggs and everything is something that is very easy to

204
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,360
measure or track. So, you know, if there is sandy soil somewhere that's usually dry, it rains a

205
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,640
little bit there and then vegetation shows up. There's a high probability that, you know, there's,

206
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,720
this would be swarms coming out of that area. And so, these conditions were established earlier in

207
00:20:52,720 --> 00:21:00,160
2019. And so, the, the right thing would be that you would, you know, inform the teams on the ground

208
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,880
that do kind of the monitoring to be able to address it. But the challenge of that particular

209
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,680
invasion, even though that early warning existed, always provided, the places where it happened were

210
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:18,000
in conflict. So, part of the genesis of that particular locus is from Yemen. And so,

211
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,120
there's not much that could have been done. And then, and so, you know, it just continued to

212
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:34,400
inspire out of control. And so, a good example, though, would be, you know, a not-so-dem example of

213
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:40,640
what you could do and it could happen. In the case for drought, if you're trying to forecast that

214
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,520
they will be food insecurity, we can see a lot of things in the growing season with satellite

215
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,800
data. And so, you can look at conditions over time, how they compared it to, you know, past years,

216
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:56,000
you can quantify damage, you can quantify extreme temperature, extreme rainfall, very low,

217
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,600
you know, low, high. And when you do that, you can give an indication of how widespread

218
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,520
crop failure might be. And so, this might be in the future, right? And so, what that would equal,

219
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,000
you know, some emergency response, which might be in time for when people actually really need

220
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,280
the support, oh, that could inform a policy, which is where it ties into the policy maker,

221
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:23,040
that the government is aware and informed of the extent of the severity, so that the response

222
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:28,160
is actually appropriate. So, assuming there'll be like, you know, 500 people and then it turns out

223
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,160
it's like 500,000 people are affected, you know, it's a big problem. And so, trying to be able to

224
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:40,800
give a better indicator of, you know, the level of response that's needed is, you know, pretty,

225
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:48,000
pretty important. You spoke a little bit about the growing access to data sets, remote sensing

226
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:57,840
data sets and earth observation data sets. Can you elaborate a little bit more on how data

227
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:05,040
availability has changed over the years and the types of data that you're using to do this kind

228
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:12,080
of work? So, you know, since the 1970s, we've had LAN monitoring systems, so we have the Landsat

229
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:19,920
satellites from NASA, they've continued that mission. And the challenge in the past was one,

230
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:25,440
we couldn't store all the data. And two, there were not enough downlink stations in order to store

231
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:32,080
the data. And so, if you go, try to go back in time, you'll find huge gaps in observation.

232
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,280
In addition to the fact that the part of the value of remote sensing is the frequency. So,

233
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,760
if you're trying to understand something over time, you need to see the same place over and over.

234
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,760
And so, then there is a modus satellite. It's called modus. It's a moderate resolution satellite.

235
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,400
And I actually, I don't think counts as moderate anymore, considering the new ranges. But

236
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:03,760
it is, it collects data over the earth every day, right? And those data have been stored since the year 2000.

237
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:10,240
And they're available for the whole world. And in addition to modus, there's a follow-on mission

238
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,880
that was meant to replace modus if it goes down. So, it's actually one of those miracle satellites,

239
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,960
because apparently it was not expected to last more than, I'm going to say, two years or three years

240
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,320
or something like that. But it's been, it's been working since 2000. And its replacement has been

241
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,800
in orbit. Well, I think for more than 10 years, actually, like when that one first came out,

242
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,520
it was like, oh my god, modus is going to disappear. But then it's still working. And I was terrified,

243
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,520
because a lot of my researchers focused on data coming from that. But this is 250 meter resolution.

244
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:46,640
So, for every pixel, it's 250 meters on the ground. This is like not great for, if you're really

245
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,320
trying to understand what's happening. So, the Landsat satellites at 30 meter to 50 meter daily is

246
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,680
great, because we can see, you can observe large scale things in a pretty decent way. And then

247
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:11,120
around 2008, 2018, the European Space Agency launched the Sentinel one and two satellites.

248
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,000
And these complement the Landsat satellites. So, in places where they were being observed

249
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:22,320
once every 14 days, it became once every three to four days, something like that. And so now we're

250
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:31,920
seeing multiple images every month for a specific area. But that doesn't include all the commercial

251
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:37,360
provisions that have been, all the commercial companies that are working in this space. So,

252
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,320
we have companies like Planet, where we have Sub-Daily, means two images in an area.

253
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,880
The data might not be directly utilized the same way as you would utilize Landsat in Sentinel too.

254
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,520
But because of this explosion in terms of cloud computing and capabilities to fuse data sets,

255
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,360
you can fuse them and kind of fill in the gaps. So, there's some incredible work that's going on.

256
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:07,440
And what that means is you just have to be able to process all that data. That makes sense of it.

257
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,720
When you say fuse them, what are the types of activities you're thinking there?

258
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,960
So, I'm going to use this example. So, you have Landsat, which is 30 meter resolution,

259
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,760
Sentinel 2, which is 20 meter resolution, can actually tell me the resolution.

260
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,360
Then there's another satellite, which is a radar satellite, Sentinel 1, which is radar data,

261
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,040
not optical data. In order to be able to view, to get insights from all of them combined,

262
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:39,840
you need to be able to process that. And sometimes they're from around the same time. So,

263
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,400
you need to be able to fuse them in a sense that when you're looking at, let's say, a mountain.

264
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,520
If you're looking at with optical data, you will probably miss some of the terrain.

265
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,080
But when you're looking at it with radar data, you can get the terrain information.

266
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,520
It's kind of an alignment problem of you have all these images of different geographical

267
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,920
areas, different time, different modalities, and how to use them together. Exactly.

268
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,960
So, that you're not using them separately to understand what is happening.

269
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:21,440
So, a big part of the technical part of your talk was focused on some of the key challenges

270
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:30,240
that you face in trying to apply this kind of new wealth of data to solving the food security

271
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,480
problem. And, you know, we were just talking about this, you know, this as a wealth of data, but

272
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:41,680
that was also your first challenge that in many ways the data is lacking in particular

273
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,000
with regard to kind of its, you know, realism and the ability to apply it to the types of problems

274
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,840
you want to apply to, and the availability of benchmarks for the kinds of tasks that you have.

275
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:00,240
Can you elaborate a little bit on that challenge and we can dig into some of the things that you've

276
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:06,320
done and your research to address it? Yeah. So, while we're just talking about the explosion

277
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,200
and data sets and, you know, there's been an explosion in products coming from these data sets.

278
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:18,000
So, we see a lot of global products on land use and crop land, among other things, you know,

279
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,240
building data sets that you could, you know, utilize for many, many different these cases. The problem

280
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,320
and the challenge is when you start looking at, you know, very specific geographies. So,

281
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,440
if a model has been developed to work really, really well for mapping maze in the United States,

282
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,000
you know, it'll probably work okay yet in Europe, maybe pretty well, because of the type,

283
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,200
I'm going to use a type of agriculture. So, we have, you know, monocrops, highly mechanized agriculture,

284
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,320
and if you're trying to understand yield, typically the farmers have combined harvesters,

285
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,440
so they know exactly what's coming out of their field. It becomes kind of pretty straightforward

286
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,360
to develop, I'm using what's straightforward, it's not so straightforward, you know, but it is

287
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:09,360
much more straightforward considering, you know, the other example I'm going to give. And so,

288
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:14,720
you can measure, we can kind of forecast and give a good indication of what productivity will

289
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,560
be in the United States. A good data set that I really like to, you know, kind of highlight is

290
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:26,800
the United States Department of Agriculture keeps updates this what's called a crop land data layer.

291
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:31,200
It's a really interesting data set, like you can see crop land over the last couple of years,

292
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:36,480
over I think maybe 20 years in the United States. And you can see, you know, shifts and changes

293
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,360
where people are growing wheat have switched to this, how they switch, how frequently they switch.

294
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:45,840
And it might seem trivial, but it's actually a really good data set in a sense that if you have

295
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,480
in addition to just where things are growing, how things are growing, and how they're performing,

296
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:56,720
you know, you can clearly understand that, you know, the production area for maybe for wheat is

297
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,840
changing because it's, you know, declining in one area, and you know, it remains steady over another

298
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,640
area. So, which could be due to warming temperatures, shifts in spring, and stuff like that, right?

299
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,680
And so, when you, you know, flip it on a tad in a sense, when you start looking in much more

300
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:21,280
complex agricultural systems, so in many Africa, you might find that for every one field that is

301
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:33,760
in the corn belt of the U.S. might be about 20, 30, 40 fields. In addition to, it does not only have corn,

302
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,960
there are multiple other crops in it. People plant at different dates, people have completely

303
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,960
different management practices. And so, some of the very basic data sets that are required to start

304
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:52,160
building models to understand production incredibly challenging. So, doing field boundaries using

305
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:59,600
existing free data like Sentinel-2, which is 10-meter resolution, is not actually easy when you're

306
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,320
looking at smallholder agriculture, because the fields are really, really small. In addition to the

307
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,720
fact that they're small, they're multiple crops. And so, you want to be able to develop

308
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:17,280
processes or models that can help you model that better. So, you can give a better indication of

309
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:22,400
what the outcome at the end of the season will be. One interesting thing, you know, that I think about

310
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:28,320
two, sometimes is like, you know, that agriculture might be criticized as, you know, not so great.

311
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,880
Like, why don't they do it the other way? Or, you know, of course, you know, the group, you know,

312
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,440
maybe in the future, everything will be sorted, or the fields will be larger, among other things.

313
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:42,560
But recognition that large-scale agriculture is actually in the long-term, detrimental, even

314
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:49,680
short-term, sometimes, to the food systems, ecosystems, entire ecosystems. So, you actually want

315
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:55,600
to be able to monitor the small scale, makes type fields better, because this is where the future

316
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,960
of a sustained system is. And so, we want to be able to do that a lot better. So, use what's available,

317
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,920
why we're advocating to get better things that are most suited to understand the systems. So,

318
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:13,520
you can provide, you know, a better indication to a farmer who might be mixing things, to tell them,

319
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:20,720
you know, or to show them, give them evidence that this particular crop does not generally do well

320
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,320
for your region, then we have tracked it over many years over a really large area. And farmers

321
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:33,680
that grow this, this ends up being a more lucrative crop, and not keep them doing or developing or

322
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:40,960
investing in those crops, and not actually meant to see them through poverty. It's an interesting

323
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,960
idea. What I'm hearing there is that, because I had that same thought, okay, so, you know, there's

324
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:56,880
those small scale farmers are in some stage of progression towards more efficient, you know,

325
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,920
large scale farming. And what I'm hearing you say is actually it's an adaptation. Small scale

326
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:09,520
farming is an adaptation to their conditions. And, you know, from that perspective, you know,

327
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,720
while it may be less efficient in some ways, it's more efficient in others for the actual situation

328
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:20,960
on the ground where they are. So we use, think about it, you use a lot less fertilizer, a lot less

329
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:29,600
input. A good example in East Africa, may is grown with beans, beans are nitrogen fixing crops,

330
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,560
so the main benefits from the nitrogen coming from the, from the beans. And so it's like,

331
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:42,480
it's like a self-fertilizing system. But if you have, you know, a highly mechanized agriculture,

332
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:48,480
there's no way to have as the beans without destroying the maize, for example. And so, I think,

333
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,680
I think about it as well. Let's not adapt the agriculture to our technology, let our technology

334
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:03,360
support the approach to agriculture, yeah. Like, it's so hard, you know, like, measuring yield

335
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,480
of productivity or crop type in a mixed field is so, so hard. It's probably next to impossible. It's

336
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:16,320
one pixel of two crops, right? But to me, it is so important that we can have some

337
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,480
a way of, you know, giving some indication, this crop, this field is mixed and when they're

338
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,720
mixed in this combination, you know, 20%, 30%, this is what the yield will be, you know, across the

339
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:35,680
two crops. Like, that is for me a much more rewarding outcome than, you know, being trying to push

340
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,320
farmers to just grow one crop so we can measure exactly what is coming from that one crop because

341
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,160
they're benefiting from, you know, this relationship, this symbiotic relationship between maize and beans,

342
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:52,320
you know, where I come from actually. It's weird, we're trying to have this project where we've

343
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:59,280
been collecting street-level imagery and we're trying to use computer vision to, to basically

344
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,280
the street to sat, yeah. So the project street to sat is like a baby, not a baby, it's like the

345
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,040
twin brother to another project called helmets, labeling crops. So the helmets are taking pictures

346
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,760
as they're writing their motorbikes and then street to sat is how we come from those images to

347
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,040
the labels that we need for our either pipeline and every time we're looking, so we're trying to

348
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:27,440
create like a data set, we're trying to label a data set that then we feed into street to sat

349
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:34,160
to detect crops over a large area. And every single time we go, if I can, if I can continue.

350
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,560
Let me continue getting you something. Now I was going to say that and every time we look at

351
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:45,440
these images, the images of where I'm from, you would find bananas beans, you find bananas beans,

352
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:55,440
a plant of sugar cane, a plant of pineapple and be like it's like in all in one image. It's all

353
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,200
in one image and everything. So like when we're doing our label cafe and going through the images,

354
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,400
I have to be in the label cafe to be like, that's not that, that's not this, that's not this.

355
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,120
But it's like, you know, by default, you know that that is like Uganda because this is like a thing,

356
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:16,800
you know, you go you, you can get your pineapple in that corner right there and then you can have

357
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,960
a thing of sugar cane to eat while you're working and then you have your beans and then you have

358
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,920
like it's just like total complete. You might actually have a coffee plant, you know, under the tree

359
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,080
because coffee does well under and the trees. So, you know, it's quite, it's quite interesting.

360
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:40,400
Talk more about street descent. Like it, what I'm gathering is that you, you've got folks on motorbikes

361
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,920
with, with cameras on their helmets and, you know, maybe cars with cameras or something else.

362
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:56,800
And you're taking these, these images from the edges of fields and using that to try to enrich

363
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:06,320
overhead satellite data. Is that right? So that sounds crazy. It is fun. So to give a good example,

364
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:14,000
typically the way you collect training data for let's say crop type. So we could, we can identify

365
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,240
from a satellite image what's crop, not crop, like what's a crop field and what's not a crop field.

366
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,840
You can look at the time, you know, like a time series data and you can tell

367
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,680
around the start of the growing season, you have to have all of this context around the started

368
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,760
growing season. You can see something go up and then down, which could be a crop, right? So you

369
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,960
can generate labels for that. So we do, you know, on screen digitization for that. You cannot do

370
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,760
this for crop type. You could, for some, if you have very high resolution data, like I know what

371
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,200
a banana looks like from space at three meter resolution. There's a very clear pattern,

372
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,920
bananas are grown spaced out because they, you know, their leaves go really wide. You can tell

373
00:37:52,560 --> 00:38:02,960
palm tree, for example, from any other tree. But even in the US, sometimes trying to distinguish

374
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,040
me from space at course resolution, like, you know, the course resolution without any prior

375
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,040
information, you might not be able to do that. And then of course, where we're working,

376
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:19,120
you have a lot smaller fields, a lot, a lot of mixes. And so we want to generate, you know, a decent

377
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:25,120
sampling, a decent training set that then you could train your hundreds of thousands of billions

378
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:34,640
of pixels over the area. And so to do this, you would typically go with your phone or GPS,

379
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,680
stand in the field, be like, with the GPS, we have these applications like open data kit,

380
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,320
use, you know, stand there, record location, crop, non-crop, open what the crop is. And then you

381
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:51,600
would go, you know, go to the next. So if you're doing this, imagine going on, you know, multi,

382
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:57,040
multi month hike over a really large area, because you need to walk from one field to another.

383
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,840
So I've done a lot of this. It takes a lot of time. It takes forever. But the number of samples

384
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:06,640
you get as so few, even if you did it like an entire year, because you were trying to do things

385
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:14,800
not only in time, but in space. So you want to map a whole country, not a small region. And so

386
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:22,800
this is, you know, where this idea of sort of doing helmets came from. The idea is GoPro cameras

387
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:31,520
have location, right? And we can take pictures as you're driving. And so we were trying to do,

388
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,000
what we're trying to do is basically collect images, street level images. So as they're writing

389
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,760
on the road, they're taking pictures as they're driving. And so we have, I think probably have

390
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,600
like over five million images now from maybe six or so countries. And so, and like we've had people

391
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:55,120
who want to volunteer to collect the data. And what that problem now, the new problem is,

392
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:59,200
we have over five million images, right? So, you know, machine learning comes really important,

393
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:06,400
really quickly, pretty, pretty rapidly. So this approach is actually pretty cool in a sense that

394
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,600
even without, you know, automating, you know, the entire process, we still have five million

395
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:20,240
images over really, really, really large geographies. And so we could use those images. You can load

396
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,880
them, for example, in Google Earth Pro. You see the image, the street, and the side of it. And you

397
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,040
could, you know, label, you can hand label maze beings in this case, which you could not do before.

398
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,760
But what we're trying to do with street to sat is reduce this. One is throw away everything that

399
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,000
does not have crop from the get go, right? So if no crop detected thrown away, we're trying to

400
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:49,040
prioritize like key food security crops from each one of the countries. And then what you want

401
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:55,360
to do next is try to detect where crops are like the specific crops. So we're labeling to create

402
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,320
like a crop type the same as I guess with like, you know, trying to detect what if it's a cat or a

403
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:06,400
dog in an image, we're trying to check whether it's maze of beings in an image. And so, and then we

404
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,760
would basically run our entire database through it and then be able to evaluate how the model is

405
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,880
performing. And hopefully, you know, come out with over a million images over, I don't know,

406
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,840
hundreds of thousands of kilometers across really, you know, large countries, because we also

407
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:30,160
wanted to capture the heterogeneity like maze in, I'm trying to think of like maze in Germany,

408
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:34,720
it does not look like maze in, you know, parts of the US. So, you know, beings, some beings look

409
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,200
very different. So we want to be able to capture these crops in different conditions.

410
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:46,400
Um, is what we're trying to achieve. And it's, you know, it's a, it's a really fun project. Also,

411
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,200
in addition to the fact that, you know, we're, we're evolving and working with everyday people,

412
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:59,920
extension agents, students, uh, tech mototaxi drivers are collecting the data. Um, you know, it's, uh,

413
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,120
and we're trying to win in many, many, many, many countries. So, yeah, you shared in your

414
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:11,360
presentation, uh, kind of a high level snapshot of the processing pipeline that you use for a street

415
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:16,960
to set. It's all Google Cloud. It looks like you've got some functions in there and you throw stuff

416
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:23,360
up on Firebase. Uh, I guess we don't need to go super deep into that, but it's, it's, um,

417
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,920
I guess the strike to me is cool that all that's available for this use case.

418
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,400
So, um, this, the, you know, I initial pipeline of street to sat was actually developed by a,

419
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:39,280
a graduate student in computer science in our, uh, in, uh, university of Maryland. And it's kind of

420
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:46,800
been iterated on over and over, but, um, Ivan, who is our machine learning developer, sort of worked on,

421
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:54,400
trying to automate, like once images are uploaded, they trigger a function that then triggers street

422
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,760
to sat and then we get an initial detection. Um, and then part of what, uh, Madhava, who developed

423
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:08,000
the initial street to sat, part of his task was to, um, make sure that we can get, you know,

424
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,440
a distance estimate. So the thing the point I didn't actually mention before is that the image

425
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,600
is on the road, but we want the field. And so, um, he was trying, you know, part of the initial

426
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:24,960
work that he did was trying to move the point from the road into the field. And then we've worked

427
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:31,040
with a, a different, uh, team of students. That actually sounds like a really tough problem.

428
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,040
Like, it is a really tough problem. Depending on the orientation, you might have fields all around

429
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,520
you. So which way do you project the, the, the point? You looking at like accelerate,

430
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,200
accelerometer data in the images or something? So there is, so the image is at timestamped,

431
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:53,360
and the rule is the, um, the camera is always facing the past and decide, no matter what the

432
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:59,760
country is, right? And so we have the timestamped, which gives us timestamped, and the direction

433
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,920
is sort of what we used to figure out where the field is. That's one point. But then, um, you know,

434
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,960
some of the, some of the initial ideas were around doing things like doing structure from motion

435
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:17,440
to like determine exactly the distance from the road, you know, from the, from the car,

436
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,000
or the motorbike to the field. But there's things that, the things that we're looking at, you know,

437
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,840
they're not buildings or cars, like may stand like little, little, little, little, little,

438
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:33,520
little, little, little lines. So like observing the same thing in multiple directions is not

439
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,880
that straightforward. Um, and so it's a, you know, it's, it's an interesting problem still. That's,

440
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:44,640
that's kind of what, um, makes it really interesting. And so right now, you know, our main focus is,

441
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,200
so we have kind of like that initial street to set up. So once we upload images, uh,

442
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:55,440
the initial street to set, detects, uh, sugar cane and maze, it gives us a preliminary map

443
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,640
with a location of where those fields are. So you can evaluate that data set, for example,

444
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:07,280
but what we're working on now is adding more crops and then trying to create what would be a test set

445
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,640
so that whenever the model produces, you know, whenever we go through the, you know, the complete

446
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,720
database, we have a good indication of like where things are and can actually evaluate whether the,

447
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:24,480
the, you know, how, how well the model is linked. Um, and then there's another component of it,

448
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,120
which is, uh, initially when we were thinking about it, uh, we would just use an app for labeling.

449
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:36,320
So we also have that, uh, data set. So, you know, we're just labeling on an application,

450
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:41,680
on the phone, which is just move the field. You just move the photograph to the crop that it is.

451
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:45,920
It still doesn't fix the distance, uh, you know, it doesn't fix the location part, but

452
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:51,760
we definitely have like, you know, somewhere to start. So it's not like there's no direction and no

453
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:58,000
location. We have location and direction. We just need to be able to move the point to the right field.

454
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,520
The other complexity is, remember, my description of the very small fields,

455
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,720
as you're driving, you could go through 30 fields in a minute, I'm making that up.

456
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,440
I'm making, I'm making that up. It's not 30 minutes, you know, 30 fields in a minute.

457
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,000
It, it could be, it could be five fields in a minute, right? It's not like, you know,

458
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,640
when you're in cancers or, uh, Illinois, when you're not in Illinois, where you're like,

459
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:30,240
we, it's just one field, right? For at least a minute. Okay. And so being able to move the image

460
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,400
to the right corresponding field is actually still hard. Um, so, yeah.

461
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:42,080
Hmm, interesting. Is street descent related to the crop harvest work?

462
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:51,920
So street, so crop harvest is, um, at database or a dataset, a package where in order for us to

463
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:59,520
develop these crop land crop type maps, we spend a lot of time labeling and all trying to collect

464
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:04,720
crop type data. But there are a lot of people who are doing it. And so crop harvest was born out

465
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:11,280
of the fact that, um, we can ingest other people's data, our own data into a package that feeds into

466
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:20,000
our, um, pipeline open map flow for crop land mapping. And so it is, it's an open source, um,

467
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:27,920
open access dataset with over 90, maybe we're like at 100,000, uh, crop land and crop type labels

468
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,680
that are sort of machine learning ready that you can pull them in your pipeline, um,

469
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:38,720
for your own, um, training. And, um, the open map flow, the way it's kind of set up, it's not

470
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:46,400
only for crop, crop land crop or crop land. Um, if you have labels for other use cases, you can

471
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,600
go if, for example, if it's buildings or forest, for example, you could utilize it to do the same.

472
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:58,320
So, but the idea was being able to use what's available and make and streamlining it. So that's

473
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:05,040
like not like, you know, different, you have to do a lot of work to, to be able to go to the next

474
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:11,760
level in your, in your group. So, and so every data that we collect feeds into crop harvest,

475
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:17,040
and when we collect, um, when we happy with our labels from sweet to sad, they will be made public

476
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:23,520
through crop harvest as well as, you know, the CSV files with, uh, you know, crop, uh, and the

477
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:30,720
location. Let's maybe jump into open map flow. One of the challenges that you talked about is this

478
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:37,200
idea of scaling, uh, deployment. And in particular, you were referencing this idea that, you know,

479
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:43,920
I guess maybe it's kind of the classic, uh, you know, academic versus real world. Like a lot of the

480
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:50,000
studies will stop at this model, but what you really need is a map in your case, um, and this

481
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:57,120
ability to get, uh, dense predictions. Um, can you elaborate on that challenge a little bit more,

482
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:03,920
and what's that, and that gap between, you know, what you see a lot and what you need, uh,

483
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:09,200
and then talk about how open map flow fits into that. So there is, um, I mean, with,

484
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:15,520
with a lot of research, usually you're, you're studying a very, it's usually a very defined problem.

485
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:21,520
So either it's a small area, um, and, you know, you collect all the labels for your small area,

486
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:29,360
you develop, you build your model perfectly and, you know, you evaluate it and, you know, publish your

487
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:34,160
paper. When it comes to coming from that small sample area that you've, you know, I don't know,

488
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:41,520
thrown every possible tool at and try to do it over a larger area, it becomes a lot, a lot,

489
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:49,040
you know, it becomes very, very complicated. So as part of, um, open map flow, you know, kind of the

490
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,960
the motivation for it is that we get requests and all with our own work we need to develop

491
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,080
these very basic products. So we need crop land because we want to know where crops are,

492
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,240
so we can look at their conditions or we can try to look at yield. We will need crop type, you

493
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:14,480
know, going further down the line. So in order to do this at scale continuously, it, you know,

494
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,880
with the capacity we have, we can't be doing it from scratch every time. And so,

495
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,640
open map flow, you know, developed by Ivan, who's a machine learning engineer,

496
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:34,240
is motivated by one, optimizing resources. So every time you try to use deep learning models

497
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:38,880
and cloud compute, you know, it just becomes too expensive. In addition to we are trying to

498
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,440
predict over really, really, really, really large areas. The question is we want to know how much

499
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,200
does it cost if somebody wanted to do it? One of, that's one of the questions, you know, we want to

500
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,160
know how much it costs in terms of input and time. So like in, you know, in initial work, it just

501
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:58,240
like took, it took a really long time to get to where it is right now, but where we are is that

502
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:04,320
we have a clear kind of work stream, a very well documented process. That's all public.

503
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:12,240
We have tasks that are set for ourselves. And this, I think the other part is being able to have

504
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:17,280
additional people contribute to our work, as well as if we have new team members, we can

505
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,560
continue to produce these things that we said that we do and we do really well. That's the other

506
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:31,760
thing. And so, coming from developing a cropland map for Togo, this is in 2020, the beginning of

507
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,760
the pandemic, where the Togo Lee's government went to know where all the croplands are for

508
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,840
programs that they were trying to implement to be able to figure out where to send money, where

509
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:50,720
farmers might be. So, cropland is a proxy for where farmers are. And so, when they needed the map

510
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:56,240
in 10 days, so imagine the scrambling that it's not a lot of scrambling that we had to do one,

511
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:03,040
there were no labels for Togo, they might have been less than 10. So, labeling, Togo,

512
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:10,320
running it and then evaluating the map and then delivering it, that was a process. And then

513
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:18,560
the next part was, can we run this at scale in the sense that Togo, Kenya is many times the size of

514
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:26,160
Togo in a larger country with more complexity, because parts of Kenya has different ecological

515
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:29,760
systems. And so, there's these things that you have to consider when we're training the model,

516
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:34,240
like the density of your samples, like those sort of sort of, you know, additional things,

517
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:39,120
it becomes much more complex in other countries or it's simplified in others. And so then there was

518
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:44,480
Kenya. And then we had to do it for six countries, then we had to do for Uganda, Ronda, Tanzania.

519
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,280
So, the question is like, how do we get, how do we not do what we did during Togo, how do we,

520
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:53,920
you know, how do we not do what we did during Kenya and kind of keep those parts that work really

521
00:52:53,920 --> 00:53:00,080
smoothly and kind of have them streamlined, that's where OpenMapflow is. And since we're, you know,

522
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:06,480
it's the same kind of the input as the same. So, time series of Sentinel, Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2 data,

523
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:12,720
you can utilize it for other things, like buildings or forests, because, you know, we use the same

524
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:19,360
data sets to map these additional things. So, it's kind of a, it's a Python library and it's,

525
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:25,360
it like maps out your entire pipeline for processing these images, training models, and then

526
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:35,840
creating at the end maps. So, it's basically, in addition to, you know, after you run your model,

527
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:42,960
you know, look at the evaluate it, you can decide whether you want to, you know, develop a map,

528
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:49,520
or if you want to improve your training data, in order to actually get to an accuracy that is

529
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:57,680
acceptable. So, trying, if we get, you know, the model's accuracy is 0.001, we probably don't want

530
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:03,280
it at all to bother with, you know, running it at scale. And so, we kind of set like a threshold

531
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:09,520
of 0.7.75 before we can, you know, try to develop a map that then is evaluated. So, in addition to,

532
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:15,440
once the product, the final map is produced, it's not final, it has to be evaluated. And so,

533
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:21,760
on top of that, I have a student who's developed this tool for evaluating. So, like a, a graphical

534
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,600
user interface based on Google attention, for someone who does not need to know how to make a map,

535
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,640
or, you know, do fancy things, but they can zoom in and out and kind of evaluate where the map

536
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:38,560
is doing poorly. And then we use those as input, you know, as training into the model again,

537
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:43,280
and try to improve it for the next iteration. Because there's also the fact that you might have,

538
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:49,920
you know, 90, whatever, something, percent accuracy. But in fact, your model is, the output is

539
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:56,720
really poor. So, use this example showing, you know, what cropland is in the smallholder systems

540
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,760
that we're looking at, an existing global product that has potentially, you know, an affluent

541
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:08,480
school of 0.7, right? But when, and then with the same score in another region, you know, it's clear

542
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:14,640
that it is cropland. So, the fields, the fields in the United States or in Europe have clearly,

543
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:21,760
you know, fields. With the same accuracy over Kenya or Rwanda, you might find, you know,

544
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:25,840
very poor results. And that's because, you know, either the design of their,

545
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:34,640
their approach is flawed in some sense, where the labels are coming from a specific area,

546
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,440
or the people who did the labeling, and are familiar with the context of the, you know,

547
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,560
the other countries or the distribution of labels is not, is not represent the area that they're

548
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:50,720
mapping. So, those are some of like the additional things. And so, we have that end, end, end, end,

549
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:58,640
end evaluation where somebody looks at it and determines whether it is good enough. You know,

550
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:05,280
we can never get it to 100% of beautiful painting, but we want to be confident that, you know,

551
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:12,320
we don't have a whole city label that is cropped. For example, or a whole swamp label, you know,

552
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:19,120
a whole swamp, you know, mapped as cropland, just because we train the model really poorly.

553
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:23,440
And they're the part of the complexity too, which is where trying to think about things like

554
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,320
these, where they call agroecological zones, the distribution of crops in time and in space,

555
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:36,480
in addition to very complex or simple crops like rice that might have the same exact

556
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:44,560
and porous signals as a swamp with just some grass, right? And so, this is where the problems

557
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:50,240
end up happening where you have something labeled as cropland when it's actually just a swamp.

558
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,880
So, yeah. And usually people who know these areas, you can just say that that is wrong,

559
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,560
like automatically, you know, they don't need to actually be physically on the ground,

560
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:08,000
but they know that this area is definitely swamp. Or if it is crop type, they know this is definitely

561
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,840
a sugar cane belt and not maze, you know, so your map is really bad. So open map flow provides a way

562
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:23,040
to kind of close that feedback loop and pull labels back into the system based on the predicted maps.

563
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:34,080
Interesting, interesting. So, the third challenge is this whole idea of learning from limited

564
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:43,120
label data. And you just mentioned this broad challenge of context. And you're doing some

565
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:51,600
interesting things to try to address that multitask learning and what you call task-informed meta-learning.

566
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:56,160
Can you talk about that challenge broadly and those approaches that you've developed?

567
00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:04,480
So, this is the meta-learning and the task-informed meta-learning has been work that's been developed

568
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:11,360
by our other machine learning developer, Gabrielle Singh, who's at McGill University. And specifically,

569
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:18,720
this is going towards the crop type mapping. So, while we're compiling crop harvest,

570
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:24,640
so while we can do cropland, I'd say that doing crop type properly is, you know, the end

571
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:32,880
objective because we want to know conditions for specific crops. But even in our 90,000-plus

572
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:42,800
data set of crop type labels, over 80 or 90 percent of them are actually just crop non-crop

573
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:49,920
and is very limited crop type. And one of the reason for this is, well, it's expensive to collect,

574
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:56,080
as I mentioned before, and one of the motivations, of course, for helmets and street-to-sat

575
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:00,400
is that we want to be able to have labels over really large areas. But prior to that,

576
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:12,160
in, I think in 2020 or 2021, we had these labels from Kenya from a small region. And so, Gabi

577
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:20,480
kind of set out to evaluate whether with this small, very few labels, you can generate a decent map.

578
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:25,680
So, part of the limitation, of course, is that you can evaluate it over a really large area,

579
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:33,360
but would a meta-learning or a task-info meta-learning model perform, you know, give similar results

580
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:38,640
compared to like other other models. So, you know, trying to do, to use like random forest for

581
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:49,280
crop type mapping when you have 60 labels over a whole county in Kenya, does not really work.

582
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:54,960
And so, that's kind of the motivation for that. So, at the same time, while we're trying to learn

583
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:00,320
efficiently, we're also trying to address the gap. So, then, you know, later on, we can, you know,

584
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:04,880
we can further evaluate whether the meta-learning model will perform the same as,

585
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:11,120
or better than one if we have, you know, if we're drowning in labels in that sense.

586
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:18,480
And so, with the multi-task learning, how does the multi-task help kind of inform that context?

587
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:24,320
Metal-learning models typically, you know, work, you basically try to kind of pre-train on a lot

588
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:30,000
fewer labels. The other, I think, the other component in that particular pipeline is the fact that

589
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:37,120
you can kind of sort of pre-train a model with giving it examples of like what crops generally look

590
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:43,840
like in a particular area. And then, you know, find, and then try to prioritize those labels for

591
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:51,760
that specific task. So, I think it's also one of the, one of the motivations for, for crop

592
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:58,240
harvest in the sense that when we're trying to do problem mapping in Kenya, there are other labels

593
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:03,920
from other places. So, are there other things we can learn about crop land generally?

594
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,520
And then, can we learn that can be useful for understanding crop land specifically in Kenya?

595
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:16,080
So, the case for Maze is that, you know, giving a model example of what Maze looks like,

596
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:21,600
because we might have more Maze labels in the United States first and in France, but not so many

597
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:30,960
in Kenya, is there useful information that the model can utilize to better map Maze in Kenya?

598
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:38,400
I guess I'm trying in my head to combine multitask, which I think of as like

599
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:43,840
you're training some model and it has multiple objectives and you're kind of using them together

600
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:52,960
and meta-learning, which is like learning languages. Like learning abstract construct

601
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:59,280
abstract things that help the model like perform better.

602
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:07,280
I think the summary there is that labels her big problem and the use cases that you're trying to

603
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:17,920
work on and in addition to kind of building out data sets and kind of tooling for mapping,

604
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:26,480
there's algorithmic work that can be done to use techniques like multitask and meta-learning

605
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:35,280
to try to enhance your ability to create models in these limited label data environments,

606
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:43,520
scenarios. So use what might be available in other geographies where the data might be more

607
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:52,080
readily available and then in addition to, I mean when I think the biggest challenge we've had,

608
01:02:52,080 --> 01:03:02,160
so Gabby tried to run, you know, try to scale the Maze model that performed really well for this

609
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:10,000
small area but even with the result that we have, we don't have any data to evaluate the result

610
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,960
because over the larger area we don't have examples of that specific crop that we're trying to map

611
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:21,520
and so which is why we're like approaching these like all these problems even though they're

612
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:28,640
very different but the same they're all part of the broader objective addressing that because I

613
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:37,840
think, you know, even if we were able to get to a really efficient model in a long term,

614
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:42,880
but if we kind of evaluate it over the larger area we would still be, you know,

615
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,600
it would still not be yet a good place in that sense. Yeah, I mean part of what strikes me is

616
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:53,680
really cool about the approach you've taken is that you just all of the systems that you've created

617
01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:02,320
that kind of tie together to, you know, ultimately solve this set of big carry problems.

618
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:11,280
Yeah, I think when you're working on one you realize that, you know, something is a huge gap

619
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:15,920
and in order to advance this one task you will need to advance this other task and so

620
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:25,600
while Gabby is trying to work on, you know, crop type mapping, we're also trying to figure out

621
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:32,160
a way of addressing the crop type data gap and so when these two things converge in the future

622
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:38,000
we would have a very good space. So when we're developing, so within OpenMap 4 is to be

623
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:44,640
called crop mask. It was, you know, there's a part of the pipeline that focuses on crop mask

624
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:51,520
generation. In that process we have to streamline label generation. So we use a platform called

625
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:57,120
Collect Earth Online that allows you to look at multiple times series of multiple different

626
01:04:57,120 --> 01:05:06,800
satellite images that we use to derive our labels and so like part of what Ivan did was trying to

627
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:17,760
figure out how to one create your labeling projects, your labeling project and once it's done

628
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:25,280
it's pushed into OpenMap 4 that then, you know, gets into your, then you have your map at the end

629
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,960
that is evaluated and you run it at scale and then someone evaluates it that then feeds back so

630
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:37,520
that it's not like individual things that are all hanging out on their own, you know, so that you're

631
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:46,000
not, when you're in Collect Earth, you don't necessarily, you know, it's not such a download this

632
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:52,640
pool this year, put this here, type process. So it's, you know, it's a huge, a huge efforts towards

633
01:05:52,640 --> 01:06:00,000
efficiency in the entire pipeline and we hope that, you know, the crop type mapping would also be

634
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:07,840
at that same level once we have the labels, which is where street to sat comes in, that once we

635
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:14,000
have street to sat, it would need, you know, it emerges into crop harvest that crop harvest is

636
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:24,080
already married to OpenMap 4 that then improves our crop type mapping. Yeah, yeah, you mentioned the

637
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:33,040
kind of the the Togo scenario and your ability to kind of provide this rapid response to the

638
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:42,880
government there in 10 days. Are there other kind of success stories or you know, moments or projects

639
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:48,160
that you and your team are proud of as an example of what this kind of work can enable?

640
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:56,400
This is, guess how many? One right now we're working on supporting regional food balance sheet

641
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:02,800
which is meant to give a regional indication of product productivity across multiple countries

642
01:07:02,800 --> 01:07:10,720
in including Zambia, Malawi, Uganda, Ronda, Tanzania. And the idea is that all of these countries have

643
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:16,640
some place where they understand what production is in the larger region because it may be, you know,

644
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:21,600
exchange of crops. So the dashboard goes beyond this production, it looks at prices among other

645
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:30,000
things. And so our contribution in this is trying to do yield forecasting at scale. And so it's

646
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,800
in the sense that as in in multiple countries, using the same approach, you have the same understanding.

647
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:41,840
What's really good about this is that it gives an indication for a policy maker like what to do,

648
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:48,880
who to who to who to have deals with, you know, because fundamentally one of the biggest problems,

649
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:52,800
I did not give this example. I was there and I give it more and more nowadays is that

650
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:59,520
one of the biggest problem in Africa is infrastructure which empaths on food security because

651
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,320
you can't just move things if you want to. There's not, you know, storage facilities among

652
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:12,000
that things and it's easy to, you know, import for Egypt to get wheat from Ukraine. It's a lot easier

653
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:19,600
than it is to put together, for example, from South Africa or Zambia. And so this understanding

654
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,520
can open up markets and opportunities for these countries to collaborate and treat among us

655
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:31,200
each others. But another example is this, there's a risk financing which sort of like, you know,

656
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:40,960
one of the things that kind of motivates my work is that the data sets we have can give us an

657
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:46,720
indication of how to respond better or do things better. And so the motivation of this project

658
01:08:46,720 --> 01:08:52,720
was that in this particular region in the northeast of Uganda, droughts always happen.

659
01:08:52,720 --> 01:09:00,240
This, there's always crop failure almost every year and some pockets of this particular region.

660
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:09,760
And the question is how early can we know and how bad are things? So what's the scale of our

661
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:16,960
response? And so the idea was to use remote sensing data to be able to answer those questions.

662
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:25,040
So the level of severity across the region and the government has got a loan or has a loan or

663
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:32,160
grant from the World Bank. And there are this part of money that was intended for if there's a

664
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:39,520
problem, use this money distributed in this region based on some method, some metric. And so

665
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:46,960
part of what we did was use remote sensing to determine the severity of drought over the long

666
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:52,480
term in space and in time and then determine to at what level like set the threshold at what

667
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:56,880
level do we decide that there's going to be a problem? We should release funds. And then when we

668
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:04,160
release funds, how do we distribute it in space? And so this project ended in 2020, they're working

669
01:10:04,160 --> 01:10:12,000
on a phase two, developing the phase two for the project going forward. And so what that means is,

670
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,200
you know, it's even though like that sort of pipeline was set and worked for that period,

671
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:21,520
for what we have to do is we need to do it better in a sense that there are newer data sets.

672
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,760
Maybe MODIS won't be able, so MODIS is the satellite mentioned before, won't be available

673
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,080
to support understanding the severity in space. In addition to its resolution, you know,

674
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:35,600
it's very poor for the context of this region is that then you want to be able to do it better

675
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:44,240
for the next iteration. And ultimately, what it meant is that people had access to other

676
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:50,000
sources of income that is, you know, outside of working in their fields that were, you know,

677
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:57,360
projected to fail in the end. So that's kind of like one of the other examples. And of course,

678
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:04,880
around accessibility, getting more people to use the tools, we've had countries implement

679
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:11,600
monitoring processes based on work that we have done. And of course, my favorite is

680
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:20,640
working with individuals and getting them to utilize and access and contribute to the

681
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:28,720
development processes over our pipeline. So street-to-sat would not exist if helmets did not exist

682
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:37,200
and helmets would not exist if border-border drivers or motorcycle taxi drivers and students

683
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:42,720
and collaborators in all these different countries, you know, we're not willing to try these things

684
01:11:42,720 --> 01:11:47,200
out with us because, you know, when you're experimenting, you're like, oh, no, you're doing it wrong,

685
01:11:47,200 --> 01:11:52,720
oh, no, maybe go back here, oh, no, you know, there's a lot of lots and lots of

686
01:11:52,720 --> 01:11:57,520
own-nose. And I mean, one of the other things is like an initials phases of street-to-sat.

687
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:02,880
What we ended up doing was we went to an agricultural experimentation site and, you know,

688
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,800
they let us drive around the site and try to do these measurements, you know, from the

689
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:12,160
car to the field and, you know, the height of the crop, those types of things.

690
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:21,280
So being able to do that and work with local researchers is incredibly rewarding. I've run into

691
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:25,840
like a lot of students that I've worked with who know I don't want to get masters,

692
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:30,960
who know I don't want to get jobs that they're proud of. And, you know, that's actually probably

693
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,320
much more rewarding than any of all the other things.

694
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:43,200
You know, are there things that jump out at you as big, you know, needs or gaps or opportunities

695
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:49,600
for, you know, maybe folks that are listening that might want to, you know, contribute in this field

696
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:57,920
in some way? Well, definitely crop type. Crop type. I mean, there, but there are lots of people.

697
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:03,200
I mean, that's the other thing about that increased access. There are a lot of people looking at

698
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:08,080
these problems. And so I'm, you know, in the future, it's short term, there will be, you know,

699
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:16,480
really good ways to go about this. But I think some of the things that jump out to me is, you know,

700
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:23,360
around policies and structures that support this development of these processes. So

701
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:34,400
having more policy makers open to the integration of these tools and their workflows.

702
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:39,760
In addition to, I think, you know, generally as scientists and researchers, being able to

703
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:48,400
communicate our work in a way that, you know, does not scare people away. But I think the other is,

704
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:53,520
of course, which size into the communication is like being able to demonstrate the true

705
01:13:53,520 --> 01:14:00,160
potential on its linkage to actual challenges, I think, is one of the most incredible things that

706
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:07,360
we can do as researchers. And I'm hoping more and more people can do that. Well, Catherine,

707
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:14,480
thanks so much for sharing a bit about what you're working on, very fascinating and important

708
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:26,240
stuff, and I really enjoyed learning about it. Thanks, and thanks for having me. Absolutely, thanks.
