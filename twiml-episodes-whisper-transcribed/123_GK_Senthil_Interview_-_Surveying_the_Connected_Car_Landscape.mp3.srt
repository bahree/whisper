00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:32,280
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:38,240
In this episode I'm joined by GK Centil, director and chief product owner for innovation at Toyota

5
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,720
Connected.

6
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,280
GK and I spoke about opportunities and challenges for smart cars.

7
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,040
We discussed Toyota's recently announced partnership with Amazon to embed Alexa in

8
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:53,200
vehicles and more generally the approach they're taking to get connected car technology

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:58,720
up to par with smartphones and other intelligent devices we use on a daily basis.

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,240
We cover in-car voice recognition and touch on the ways that machine learning and AI need

11
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:08,400
to be developed to be useful in vehicles as well as the approaches for getting there.

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,760
And now on to the show.

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:19,400
All right everyone, I am on the line with GK Centil.

14
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,720
GK is chief product owner for innovation at Toyota Connected.

15
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,560
GK, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

16
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,520
I'm glad to be here, sir.

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,000
Why don't we get started by having you tell us a little bit about how you got involved

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,680
in AI there at Toyota?

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
Sure.

20
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,680
My background is in software engineering, I've been in this field for about 18 years.

21
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,040
I did my bachelors in electronics and communication.

22
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,120
So for the last seven years or so, I'm fully involved in connected cars.

23
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:59,600
Connected cars come in all shapes and sizes and my relationship with Toyota was since 2011

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,280
and I've been with Hyundai and Toyota on and off in the last few years.

25
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:10,480
So in the past year or so, I've taken a lead on this group within Toyota Connected called

26
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:18,000
Innovation, which the objective of this is to find new products, new services, new ideas

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,520
to enhance the connected car experience for our customers.

28
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,840
And so that's where we started off with the machine learning and AI in terms of looking

29
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,720
at conversational interfaces for our customers in various endpoints.

30
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:41,320
And that's really how the involvement with AI and ML started and we've been doing few

31
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,920
different things in that area for the past nine months to an year.

32
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,720
It's pretty incredible how just a few years ago, we would think of the autumn, at least

33
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,960
those of us, or I guess I should just say myself, I don't know about anyone else, but

34
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:05,960
I would think about cars as not very technology-forward things, right?

35
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:11,960
You kind of have these built-in consoles that were many years behind what you get every

36
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:19,720
day with your phone and it seems like the industry is really waking up to the opportunity and

37
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,720
really the way consumers want to integrate technology kind of across through their lives.

38
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,200
Yes, I don't know, how do you think about the role of the connected car?

39
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,480
Yes, I'm going to say, tell me about it, right?

40
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,080
It's been a topic of everybody who's been using smartphones for the last few years in

41
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,520
the sense that they have this piece of technology that's sitting in their hands, that does various

42
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:53,000
things and then they go into the cars and what they see is really several years behind

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,200
like you said, in terms of not just the technology, it's also the user interface, how it behaves

44
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:07,080
and how it really helps customers carry on their connected lives into the vehicle.

45
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:15,040
So we all certainly know that cars have a much bigger role to play or can provide much

46
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,400
better experience when it comes to connected lives.

47
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:26,920
Which, American, I heard probably commutes about 10 hours a week or 6 to 10 hours a week,

48
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,200
so that's a waste of opportunity right now.

49
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:38,560
And without having this fixed, what we see is more accidents, more distractions, having

50
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,280
customers trying to use their smartphone as a replacement for an in-makel device, it's

51
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,640
not really designed to be.

52
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:51,240
And I believe there is plenty of things that we can do to improve that and not just make

53
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,240
use of this time in a effective way, so customers are not distracted, so safety is one aspect

54
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,240
of this.

55
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:04,480
The other aspect is essentially making this time a lot more productive, a lot more joyful

56
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:11,640
in the driving experience, we still wait for autonomous cars which may take 10 or more

57
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,960
years to become mainstream, I think we still have a lot more to do in the connected car

58
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,280
world.

59
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:26,280
One of the ways that the various car manufacturers have tried to allow us to safely engage with

60
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,120
our vehicles is through voice interfaces, and this is again one of those experiences

61
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,360
where, you know, for a few years now, like the phone kind of voice interaction experiences

62
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:43,200
was way ahead of the car interactive voice interface.

63
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,920
But the cars are now talking about, I guess I see a couple of different strategies.

64
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,760
One is just kind of advancing the technology.

65
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:58,600
The other is just wholesale outsourcing it to things like Alexa or other companies versions

66
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,400
of those things.

67
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:08,160
How does that landscape look to you and what's the approach to that at Toyota?

68
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,680
Yeah, I think you reached the core of this, you know, current technology landscape in

69
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,720
terms of, you know, how it's going to pan out.

70
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,200
You're right, the existing versions of voice recognition, you know, operate on, you

71
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,640
know, predefined phrases, and you have to be in a certain application in a certain screen

72
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:31,760
to use certain words to utilize voice recognition, it's very frustrating.

73
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,880
I haven't seen anybody actively using it successfully in their cars, you know, and we spend

74
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,040
a lot of money on this, so to actually put this in the cars, but unfortunately, it's

75
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,440
not really useful.

76
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,160
So the next wave is obviously, you know, taking from the home experience where we have these

77
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,840
virtual assistants sitting in terms of, you know, what you see as Alexa or Google Assistant.

78
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,160
So, and of course, the smartphones provide similar experience, so customers want to carry

79
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,480
that over.

80
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,840
And that's obviously the next wave of the experience that's the, you know, the customers

81
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:12,600
need in the car and what we also want to provide in the car, which is, you know, fully natural

82
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:19,720
language, you know, conversational dialogue oriented, you know, use in, you know, it understands

83
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:25,680
the context, it understands, you know, what your habits and provides response. So voice is

84
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,480
definitely the key aspect of understanding what the customer needs.

85
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,920
The technology that Google and Alexa brings and how that's going to fit in the car, you

86
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,440
know, whether the automakers are going to outsource to these players.

87
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,000
I think there are few key things to understand.

88
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,560
So the vehicle is not a smartphone equivalent.

89
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,400
I think there are a lot of misconceptions. Yes, in a way, it is an extension of your digital

90
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,680
life. It's another device. It's an electronic screen. So there is some comparison there.

91
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,000
But also vehicle, you know, you are actually using it for driving from point A to point

92
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,480
B. It's not a thousand dollar device. It's a $30,000 device or $40,000 device.

93
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Right.

94
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,560
So as a customer, you know, I should be able to comfortably use my vehicle through my

95
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,800
muscle memory. And there are a lot of things when it comes to just the user experience.

96
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:26,360
How the customer interacts with a car versus a phone. So I believe it's a hybrid of, you

97
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,480
know, the technology that Google or Amazon provides with respect to their assistance and deep

98
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:39,640
integration into what the vehicle can do and, you know, how the vehicle ecosystem works.

99
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:44,920
I think a hybrid of these would provide the best of experience to the customer. And we

100
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,080
are ready to, we are actively working on this. We're actively looking into various aspects

101
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,040
from, you know, user experience to data protection to privacy and, you know, all these different

102
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,880
aspects on how this, you know, what the exact model that's going to help the customers.

103
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,400
Ultimately, that's the aim here to help the customer. So if you look at deep vehicle

104
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:11,520
integration, we have access to the vehicle, you know, controllers, the data that comes

105
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:19,600
out of the vehicle, you know, we know how driving works. We know automotive. So the virtual

106
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,160
assistant in the car has to be able to take advantage of that needs to know, you know,

107
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:33,200
okay, my gasoline or fuel tank is just, you know, 10% more and should I suggest a gas

108
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,720
station nearby. And this is data that we have about the car and we know that customer,

109
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,800
you know, typically prefers filling it in the last minute versus, you know, some customer

110
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,920
that, you know, really talking about filling the gas tank when it's just quarter more.

111
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,400
So all these have to be taken into consideration building this experience.

112
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,520
Can you give some other examples of kind of how the, you know, when you think of this,

113
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:08,600
like hybrid experience that enables use cases that's not really attainable by just pulling

114
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,480
in a third party thing like an Alexa, what are the things that like most jump out at you?

115
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,320
I think there are, you know, most customers when you when you are in the car, you know,

116
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,440
three main things. So navigation, you want to go from, you know, one place to another

117
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,760
place, you want to find, you know, interesting places to go or restaurants to go. So it's,

118
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,720
you know, can put everything under navigation. Definitely media consumption, whether it's

119
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,440
music or podcasts or, you know, anything that you do in the car takes up majority of your

120
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,520
time. And then communication, which is, you know, just essentially messaging, which is,

121
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,800
which is one of the most distracting aspects of vehicle. So these three key areas, you

122
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,520
know, I firmly believe it needs to be customized for the vehicle and how the vehicle operates

123
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:59,600
and, you know, how you interact with your steering wheel switches another tactical knobs in a way.

124
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:06,480
So these are some of the areas which could be done well by both the, you know, OEMs,

125
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:12,160
the automotive OEMs and the players that are out there. So this is something that needs to be

126
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,200
carefully considered on how we do. The vehicle specific use case, one I already mentioned like

127
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,040
about knowing your fuel levels. The other could be about your driving behaviors, right? So,

128
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,640
you know, there are use cases where you could actually essentially coach the, coach the driver on

129
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,920
how their driving is, you know, take their emotions in future, you know, could be facial recognition.

130
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,400
Are they tired? Are they sleepy? You know, are they frustrated? Are they driving it a little bit

131
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,840
more rashly? You know, we can detect all this. And so it's not, then it becomes not just

132
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:54,400
why it becomes multimodal, right? So you're essentially being an assistant, listening,

133
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:00,000
observing and, you know, providing some suggestions. And this requires inputs from multiple

134
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:07,040
vehicle sensors and knowing how the customer drives, right? And what are the different reactions

135
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,120
in the vehicle systems that are causing this to provide, you know, and this could ultimately save

136
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,880
lives or save time or so. Those are the examples I could think of, but, you know, vehicle has,

137
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,960
you know, various aspects to it when it comes to a life cycle of a customer on how they use the

138
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:33,760
vehicle. So things that you could see like service, right? After like maintenance. So your oil

139
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,280
quality is low. Do you want to take it for an oil change? So these are some other examples where

140
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:45,440
you integrate with the dealership or ecosystem. And that's something where we can, we can provide a

141
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:54,800
lot more oil, a lot of oil through the system. What kind of approaches are you taking to, to kind

142
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:03,280
of get there? So without talking about any secret sauce, like I said, we're looking at, you know,

143
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:09,200
from a plain natural language point of view, we're looking at, you know, conversational interfaces,

144
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:15,680
building it, looking at the variety of technology solutions that could satisfy this need and how

145
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,280
that could be integrated into the vehicle ecosystem. I think that's kind of in a couple of

146
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:28,880
statements summarized, you know, all the activities we do. And, you know, also, you know, just working

147
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,880
with, you know, variety of players in this area and see, you know, what can be bought off the shelf,

148
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,240
what can be integrated as a service. And those are also some of the things we are looking at.

149
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:48,240
From AI or ML perspective, it's essentially building this conversational interface and scaling it up

150
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,320
for millions of users, you know, whether through vehicles or through the chatbots for customer

151
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:01,280
service are also some of the things we are looking at. And what's your assessment of kind of the

152
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:10,400
landscape that you're seeing to date and kind of the readiness to support the vehicle use case?

153
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:17,040
Like are there, for example, in vehicles connectivity can be intermittent, but you still have,

154
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,320
you know, you potentially have people depending on these capabilities. Like are those some of the

155
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,920
challenges that you're facing and do you see the technology as being kind of evolved enough

156
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:35,600
to support those? Yes, connectivity is a good question. So connectivity is one aspect that

157
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:44,160
differentiates in a vehicle experience. So anything critical, you know, like we have services that

158
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,600
can, you know, inform a call center operator on an event of a crash, right? So even those services

159
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:57,120
currently rely on your 4G connectivity or wireless connectivity to operate. So,

160
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:04,000
but those services can operate with limited data connectivity. They're sending small amounts of

161
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,640
data, but when it comes to a voice experience, you're looking at, you know, streaming audio. So

162
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,560
there's definitely a challenge, but I believe it's been improving a lot in terms of coverage and

163
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,400
speeds. 4G is much more prevalent than, you know, just a few years ago. And it's going to be just

164
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,480
upgraded to faster speeds, wider coverage. So we need to still design for it. We need to still

165
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:34,720
design for connectivity issues, but I think given the nature of some of these services, most of them

166
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:42,640
are non-critical. You know, we turn them as infotainment service. So that should be something we can

167
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:50,640
take care of. The main aspect we are looking at is, you know, a conversational voice interface

168
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:54,880
in a vehicle is much different, could be much different than, you know, what you have at home

169
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,840
or a smartphone. I believe that's where, you know, the product design has to evolve to capture

170
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:08,080
that user experience and have the technology be able to support it, right? So simple examples

171
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:16,640
could be in your vehicle when you're asking for something, if the vehicle keeps asking for

172
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:22,720
confirmation, that could be very distracting, right? So there are certain things we need to work

173
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:28,880
around or change in the way the users work with the vehicle and also make it multimodal, right?

174
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:35,520
Because we have a heads up display, we have the dashboard, we have the multimedia unit as well.

175
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:42,320
So how can the visual and the auditory output combine and work together to make this user experience

176
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:48,400
better? So when you combine these, then even the technology has to adapt to these different

177
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,360
multimodal inputs in a way. So those are, you know, essentially some of the challenges.

178
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,600
Has Toyota announced specific, like a specific set of partners around this voice assistant

179
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:07,600
market or if not, you know, what's your general take on kind of the timeline for seeing that

180
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:15,360
technology in vehicles? We had already announced a partnership with Amazon and the CES.

181
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,320
So some form of Alexa experience is going to be brought into the vehicle for the immediate term.

182
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:30,080
I think for a more deeper integrated experience, it's going to take a few years.

183
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,880
You know, I can't give a specific timeline now. It's still looking into, you know, various aspects.

184
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:41,920
But I think the future where we are looking at a variety of vehicle inputs and integrating

185
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,480
into this experience is at least two or three years away for Toyota.

186
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:54,640
Not to say that we won't have an experience before that. It's just that there are various levels

187
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,760
to it, right? So when I talk about facial recognition and emotions and seeing, I think those are

188
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,240
definitely, you know, three to four years away. There's cost involved in having even a camera

189
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:11,920
to recognize your facial expression. So some of those, it would depend on whether it's a luxury

190
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:20,000
vehicle versus an economy vehicle. So those would also impact the timelines. In terms of partners

191
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,360
other than Alexa, I think we are working with, you know, different other players, not to name names,

192
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,440
but, you know, hopefully we'll soon, you know, announce those partnerships in the next few months.

193
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:39,600
Were you at CES this year? Yes, I was. Okay, I was there also. So maybe I see this question.

194
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,120
I've been kind of waiting for someone, a good person to ask this question. So you guys announced

195
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,920
this partnership with Alexa. And in fact, at, you know, CES, basically everyone was kind of

196
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:59,280
announcing these partnerships with Alexa and Google Assistant. And like, I feel like this is really

197
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:09,280
consumer driven or is this kind of the, you know, this ecosystem getting way out ahead of what

198
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:16,160
consumers want. Like, I don't, I've got Alexa's around here and Google Assistant's around here.

199
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:21,840
And, you know, they're basically, I say this all the time. Like, I think the technology is amazing.

200
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,080
And that over time, it will evolve to be, you know, extremely useful. And I think that

201
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:35,120
targeted voice interfaces definitely have a place. But right now, you know, I think of them as

202
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,480
like expensive timers and alarm clocks, right? So most expensive egg timer I have ever bought.

203
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:49,440
And I'm just not sure that it's the consumer that is driving these things into refrigerators

204
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:58,640
and washing machines and cars and ironing boards and like garage doors, everything. What do you

205
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:05,520
think? So I may have a different take on this. My personal opinion, not, you know, of course, not

206
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,200
to it as, but, you know, I got the Alexa when it first came out of the market pre-ordered, same

207
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,200
did with the Google Assistant and been using it. And, you know, my wife's opinion was the same

208
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,080
as yours. You know, why do we buy this expensive timer? I know this just, you know, and do two things.

209
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:27,600
But I think it has evolved over a period of time. You know, you started asking for weather and you

210
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,200
started playing music. Now, you know, we can't live without it for playing music, right? So

211
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,600
just come home, you know, and then say a command and you have a nice little background music going.

212
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,360
So I think the utility, even though it is limited, it's expanding. And once you know, and this is where

213
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:53,280
we, you know, there is an adaptation from the human side to say, this is how I use the technology

214
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:01,360
to get the best use, right? So you know exactly what to ask. So my daughter knows exactly what to ask.

215
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,440
And she knows if you ask it in a different way, it's not going to be useful. So I think when

216
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,480
when humans start learning how to use this technology for one thing at a time, maybe you're using

217
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,520
it just for timer today, tomorrow, you may use it for weather. So over a period of time, you start

218
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,760
using it for minor things. I think, and then six months down the line, I take away all the Alexa's

219
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,320
and Google homes from your home. You're going to be very frustrated, believe me. So I think there is

220
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:37,360
utility. It's limited, but it expands and humans start to learn and adapt on how to use it for

221
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,360
specific use cases at specific times. So there is definitely customer demand and you could look at

222
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:50,480
the sale of these, these units over the last holiday period. So and take that into the car,

223
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:56,160
it's, you know, whether it's customer demand or not, you need a really good conversational

224
00:21:56,160 --> 00:22:00,240
interface in the car. There's no better place than car for these kind of interfaces, right?

225
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,440
Yeah. So there is part customer demand, but there's also part and need for this to have in the

226
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:13,840
vehicle, you know, 10 years ago, and you know, at least now we are starting to have these in the car.

227
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:20,000
So I feel, I feel it's, it's well-deserved attention given to these technologies to be brought

228
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,720
into the car better late than never. So I do, I agree that the car is one of the places where,

229
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:36,960
you know, particularly when you've, you've got the integrations that you've described, all set up

230
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,720
and figured out, you know, there's a lot of value there because, you know, until the car is driving

231
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,920
itself, like it'd be better for me to keep my eyes on the wheel than to, you know, dial a phone

232
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:59,520
or change the temperature or whatever. So that said, like when you think about an Alexa, what's the role

233
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:09,440
of Alexa? Is Alexa a service at the front end that's doing kind of the speech recognition and,

234
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:16,240
you know, is it a platform that's figuring out intense and all that kind of stuff or does Toyota

235
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,920
develop technology, you know, or need to develop technology that does all that because that's where

236
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:29,200
the integration needs to happen. And then Alexa is this back end kind of portal to a bunch of other

237
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,600
consumer services. That's again, going to the heart of the problem on, you know, what we are dealing

238
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:44,560
with. So you seem to have been involved in this for quite a time. So, but yeah, that's a very good

239
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:52,960
question. Multiple people have multiple opinions on this. My personal opinion is we need to have these

240
00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:00,640
technologies as a base, you know, whether we build it or whether we get partners to do it, I think

241
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:08,400
these technologies are going to be used in various different interfaces, right? So even things like

242
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,960
chatbots for customer service, you know, today we have thousands of calls coming into our call center

243
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:20,320
asking about how to use a particular vehicle system or how to use a particular setting in their

244
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,920
navigation to do what they want to do. And, you know, we could we could reduce a lot of these

245
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:31,600
customer calls with, let's say, a simple chatbot available through their messenger app or whatever.

246
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,400
And then if you're able to do it really well, it's going to be much easier for the customer

247
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,320
rather than picking up the phone to get answers. So I think the technology as a base is going to

248
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:49,600
serve multiple endpoints. So we need to approach it from that perspective. And then your in-vehicle

249
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:55,280
is just another or more, you know, it's most important, but it's another interface for the customer.

250
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:00,880
So if you look at it from that perspective, it's definitely, you know, imperative for us to have

251
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:07,200
the technology to do this. And, you know, all these different ecosystems from from these

252
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,680
assistant providers bring all the integrations that they already have to add on to this experience.

253
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:21,440
I'm curious about maybe there's more like culture, you know, auto manufacturer culture meets AI

254
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,240
and like how that all works and are there, you know, things that you're seeing where, you know,

255
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,000
ways in which the organization is changing to adapt to kind of this new way of thinking about

256
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,680
interfaces or things like that or things that you think personally need to happen for large kind

257
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:45,440
of engineering culture, traditional engineering culture driven organizations like auto manufacturers

258
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:53,840
to adopt this technology. Yes. And that's a good segue. So I can talk about data connected.

259
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,880
So that's the reason Toyota connected was set up. So Toyota itself is a huge conglomerate

260
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,840
that everybody knows. Toyota connected is set up as a technology company to build this innovation

261
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,240
from within, right? So typically the service providers or, you know, companies that specialize in

262
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,760
product development, whether it could be AI, ML or, you know, natural language or anything else

263
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,320
for that matter. Now they are out, they're not the automotive company itself, right? So as an

264
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,520
automotive company, we know how customers, you know, we know what customers want, we know how

265
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:38,640
customers behave, we know how our vehicles behave. So just fusing these two, you know, the technology

266
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:46,880
and innovation capabilities with this domain experience is really a key area for us to move forward.

267
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,200
Right? So everybody has to become a technology company in order to survive in this new way of

268
00:26:53,200 --> 00:27:00,640
thing. So, so that's that's the primary purpose. Toyota, you know, connected was set up. So with

269
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:07,440
the, you know, our management encourages innovation. It's an open culture startup atmosphere, except

270
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:14,640
with a nice backing of the huge Toyota name. And that's essentially brought into, you know,

271
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,920
attract talent who can, who can build this from within and make sure it gels with the customer

272
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:28,160
needs, right? So it's, it's like fusing this hardware and software together built by the same

273
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,600
same player has its own advantages. So that's, that's, that's what we're looking at,

274
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,720
to doing, at doing in Toyota connected. And I hope that answers your question is probably

275
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,040
if we're asking whether it's needed or not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like it is. And it's,

276
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:53,520
that's kind of the way you're addressing it. And so what other, are there other ways that,

277
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:00,400
or areas that Toyota connected is looking at AI beyond, well, you mentioned, we talked extensively

278
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,960
about the voice interface. You mentioned chatbots as a customer service experience. So there are

279
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:13,600
other ways that Toyota connected is looking at AI. Yes. Toyota connected has built a connected,

280
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,720
you know, it's a car sharing platform. And you've probably heard about it in CES when, when our

281
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:25,120
president talked about E palette and some of those services that come with the car sharing

282
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,760
economy. And in fact, we had launched a pilot in, in Hawaii as well for car sharing. So that

283
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:38,240
is going to, you know, give us some opportunity to optimize the sharing economy in terms of,

284
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,640
you know, what are the best places in the town to keep cars so people can make it lies, you know.

285
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:51,600
So there's, there's a demand forecasting, you know, heat map. Can we change the pricing based

286
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,240
on the demand so we can get better utilization of the car? So there's a lot of things that you can do

287
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:03,120
with with ML in the in the car in the car sharing economy. There's also things around, you know,

288
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:09,040
preferences driver preferences, customer preferences to, you know, surface notifications.

289
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,320
And then like I said earlier, probably, you know, areas like coaching, you know, something we

290
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,440
have started working into using machine learning. So yes, there are plenty of other areas that we have

291
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,920
started investigation on how we can best leverage AI and ML. Awesome. Well, GK, thank you so much

292
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:33,840
