00:00.000 --> 00:11.200
All right, everyone. Welcome to another episode of the Twomo AI podcast. I'm, of course,

00:11.200 --> 00:17.000
your host, Sam Charington. And today I'm joined by Audrey Smith, the Chief Operating Officer

00:17.000 --> 00:22.160
at ML Twist. Before we get into today's conversation, be sure to take a moment to head over

00:22.160 --> 00:27.440
to Apple Podcasts or your listening platform of choice. And if you enjoy the show, please

00:27.440 --> 00:34.160
leave us a five-star rating and review. Audrey, welcome to the podcast. Thank you, Sam.

00:34.160 --> 00:40.000
Thanks for having me. Absolutely. I am really looking forward to our conversation. For those

00:40.000 --> 00:44.400
listening in with us, if you've been listening to the show recently, you know that we've been

00:44.400 --> 00:52.240
digging deep into data-centric AI. And this conversation will continue in this theme. And I'm

00:52.240 --> 00:58.720
super excited to have Audrey on. She's got a ton of experience with labeling, label ops,

00:58.720 --> 01:05.200
and so much more in this space. So Audrey, once again, welcome. Thanks, Sam.

01:07.360 --> 01:12.560
Let's start with a little bit about your background and how you came to work in machine learning.

01:12.560 --> 01:22.640
Sure. So I actually studied law. I am a lawyer. I studied in France. You can hear my accent, of

01:22.640 --> 01:28.240
course. And I was a lawyer in France for three years before I decided that I wanted to have an

01:28.240 --> 01:36.080
international experience. So I went to the UK, worked there for five years. And then when I moved

01:36.080 --> 01:44.400
to the US in 2014, I was really looking forward to finding my place into the tech industry.

01:46.720 --> 01:50.720
Until then, I had no technical background. I didn't know anything about machine learning.

01:50.720 --> 01:58.400
So I didn't know exactly how I would start. But I applied for jobs basically where you needed to

01:58.400 --> 02:07.120
have French speaking skills. And my first job was to listen to Siri and listen, especially to

02:07.120 --> 02:13.040
French speakers, talking to Siri. And that's the start of my data labeling journey. Really,

02:13.040 --> 02:18.400
that's when I learn about machine learning and how data labeling is so important to it.

02:19.200 --> 02:25.760
And I wanted to dig into it a little bit more, went to Google, worked on way more projects,

02:25.760 --> 02:35.600
linked to GPR compliance, user experience, ads policy, and all around data labeling. And I got

02:35.600 --> 02:42.560
hooked. So I went to Amazon, stayed there for four years, working data labeling operation as well,

02:42.560 --> 02:48.640
helping Amazonian team with their machine learning projects. Got lucky to work on a lot of

02:48.640 --> 02:57.440
different projects, pertaining to different formats like video image, text. And then after four years,

02:57.440 --> 03:04.480
went to label box, when they were still Series A. And I was the director of labeling operation

03:04.480 --> 03:11.120
over there for a couple of years. And then joined ML Twist a few months ago as their chief operating

03:11.120 --> 03:16.560
officer. Awesome, awesome. Why don't you give us a quick summary of ML twist? Sure.

03:16.560 --> 03:26.320
So really, ML Twist is coming from GID that they are the space in the data labeling space for

03:26.320 --> 03:32.080
machine learning is very crowded at the moment. There are so many different players on the market.

03:33.360 --> 03:39.520
And they're all offering different solutions. And they're like even newcomers on the market.

03:39.520 --> 03:45.520
So if you think about it, there are over 80 data labeling platforms out there. And so much more

03:45.520 --> 03:51.760
when it comes to workforce labeling companies. And now you have the newcomers that are the

03:51.760 --> 03:58.960
synthetic data platforms, the augmented data platform and so on and so on. And this is all great,

03:58.960 --> 04:04.320
all this technology is great, but they don't connect to each other in a very easy way. And they

04:04.320 --> 04:09.920
are like, it's pretty siloed. And a lot of them are even specializing certain verticals or

04:09.920 --> 04:18.160
in certain formats. And so GID behind ML Twist is to connect all this ecosystem and give companies

04:18.160 --> 04:27.360
the choice to use the right tool for the right use case. It's a kind of like middleware for

04:27.360 --> 04:36.240
your labeling software and systems. Yeah, we were called middleware. I think that's okay,

04:36.240 --> 04:42.320
that's okay to call us middleware. And really like the idea is to, you know, be the glue

04:42.880 --> 04:48.720
and connect all the different tooling so that like data science team doesn't spend time looking

04:48.720 --> 04:54.720
for the right tool, the right workforce, the right everything and just easily connect all the

04:54.720 --> 05:02.000
pieces of the puzzle together to get their machine learning model trained and performing at the

05:02.000 --> 05:09.360
right level. So let's maybe start by talking about some of the commonalities you've experienced

05:09.360 --> 05:18.080
as you've tackled labeling across many different companies and customers. What's the typical

05:18.080 --> 05:24.720
journey for an organization getting started with labeling? Yeah, that's a great question. So

05:25.600 --> 05:31.920
whether it's a small startup starting the ML journey or a big company who wants to enter the AI

05:31.920 --> 05:40.480
world, the journey is very similar. As I mentioned earlier, the space is very crowded with a lot of

05:40.480 --> 05:46.160
very great tools on the market. And the idea for these companies that just start their journey

05:46.160 --> 05:51.120
is that they don't have a data labeling operation person in house. Usually data scientists,

05:51.120 --> 05:56.720
machine learning engineers or product managers are the ones like who are really trying to get

05:56.720 --> 06:03.360
all the right pieces in place. And without any knowledge, without any background, it's quite

06:03.360 --> 06:11.840
overwhelming to go after it and you have to find your right data labeling tool. And as I said,

06:11.840 --> 06:16.320
there are many on the market which one is the best one for your use case and then the right

06:16.320 --> 06:21.600
workforce and depending on what you want to label, each workforce is going to have their own

06:21.600 --> 06:28.960
strengths and their own weaknesses. So like you have to find, assess them and then make your

06:28.960 --> 06:34.000
own choice and selection. And that's just it takes time. It takes like probably a few months to

06:34.000 --> 06:39.200
get there. And once you get that in place, there is also the formatting issue, right? Because you

06:39.200 --> 06:45.280
have your data in house with a certain format and you need to connect that to the data labeling

06:45.280 --> 06:49.920
platform that you're going to be using. So data scientists are going to have constantly to change

06:49.920 --> 06:55.120
the format to be able to plug into the data labeling tool. And that's also another issue that

06:55.120 --> 07:00.960
needs to be tackled. So yeah, definitely you need to think about all the species and once you find

07:00.960 --> 07:07.200
the species and you connect them, you have to train, you have to create your task, put them on

07:07.200 --> 07:13.360
the platform, train the workforce on the task and go quality control, look at the quality because

07:13.360 --> 07:19.120
it's not only about maintaining, like sorry, it's not about just reaching the high quality of

07:19.120 --> 07:24.640
your data, it's also maintaining it as you go through all your rounds of data labeling. And

07:24.640 --> 07:31.440
that can be very challenging. In the early days of labeling when folks would use, you know,

07:31.440 --> 07:39.440
crowdsource, like commoditized crowdsource platforms, like mechanical Turk, you know, data quality

07:40.080 --> 07:46.560
was and continues to be a huge issue. And you know, folks would do like, have multiple lablers and

07:46.560 --> 07:57.040
try to kind of abstract away from the individual labeler to achieve levels of quality. You know,

07:57.040 --> 08:01.040
when you're using one of these labeling services, is that done for you? Or are you still

08:01.840 --> 08:08.080
having to kind of manually implement these kinds of tricks in order to achieve high quality labels?

08:08.080 --> 08:12.160
So you still have to do that, unfortunately, like the idea is that, you know,

08:12.160 --> 08:17.520
the mist that you can just like create a task and then set it up on the platform and have

08:18.880 --> 08:25.600
lablers in another part of the world, being able to nail it from the first pass is like,

08:25.600 --> 08:31.760
it's not gonna work. It can work. So crowdsourcing is a great option. Definitely when it comes to

08:31.760 --> 08:37.520
easy task, to task where you think that the knowledge is universal, right? Like is there a dog or

08:37.520 --> 08:43.040
is there a cat on the picture? You can trust anyone to know the difference. When it comes to complex

08:43.040 --> 08:48.160
tasks, then you need guidelines. You need rules in place that you're gonna train people on so that

08:48.160 --> 08:55.600
they can again annotate with high quality, but also consistently. And that's part of the challenge.

08:55.600 --> 09:01.120
And that means that companies going through that journey have to accept that feedback is

09:01.120 --> 09:06.640
very important on the top of quality control. They need to train the people. It's like going to

09:06.640 --> 09:12.880
school. You can't know like first you train and then you get tested and then you can you can

09:12.880 --> 09:20.160
deliver high quality data. And that's exactly the mindset that companies should use when they

09:20.160 --> 09:26.720
start working with outsourced labelling workforces. I had a really interesting conversation recently

09:26.720 --> 09:35.280
as part of this series with Cheyne Mahanti at Watchful. And we were talking about this same

09:35.280 --> 09:46.160
journey. And in particular, when companies do labelling inside in-house versus one to outsource

09:46.160 --> 09:54.080
it. And the key idea that he raised was this idea of context. Like you can outsource when

09:55.680 --> 10:02.800
there's no context required to correctly label. Like you said, you know, anyone can know a dog

10:02.800 --> 10:10.400
from a cat or even, you know, a stop sign on a road. But if, you know, some deep business

10:10.400 --> 10:15.760
context is required, you know, that is going to have to be done in-house. Is that your experience

10:15.760 --> 10:24.480
as well? Not exactly. So I had a chance over the years to test some of those ideas. And we were

10:24.480 --> 10:30.480
even able to test. So companies were coming to us and asking us, look, I really need doctors

10:30.480 --> 10:37.520
to annotate my data because that requires medical knowledge. And on the side, we were testing

10:37.520 --> 10:41.680
something else. We were saying, okay, let's do it with doctors. But let's do it also with

10:41.680 --> 10:47.680
regular laborers. And maybe a doctor comes in and train the people on what to do and what to

10:47.680 --> 10:56.960
recognize. And actually, we got pretty similar quality from boss ranges. So it doesn't have to be

10:56.960 --> 11:04.880
all, you know, done internally because these people have the right knowledge. It can be that we

11:04.880 --> 11:11.360
are able to transfer the knowledge. It might take longer, but we can get to very similar quality

11:11.360 --> 11:19.040
over time. That's going to be tremendously less expensive because of that. So that there are

11:19.040 --> 11:25.200
pros and cons, but it's not entirely true for my experience. But it sounds like you have to be

11:25.200 --> 11:33.520
committed to that training and knowledge transfer and feedback loop in order to achieve the

11:33.520 --> 11:40.960
level of quality you'd want with non-subject matter expert laborers. Exactly. And then that's

11:40.960 --> 11:46.400
where every company is going to make a choice. If they have to get a very fast turnaround time

11:46.400 --> 11:51.840
with high quality, obviously, you have to go with an internal team that's going to be very

11:51.840 --> 11:58.800
knowledgeable on the topic they are labeling. But if you have a bit of time and if your cost

11:58.800 --> 12:04.480
sensitive, then you might go the other route, take a bit longer, but get to the same quality

12:04.480 --> 12:12.240
after a while. Yes, maybe continue on this training, this training angle are there. Things that

12:12.240 --> 12:20.000
you've learned about how to effectively train and support laborers in the process.

12:20.000 --> 12:26.880
Yes, absolutely. I think that as a data labeling operation, people really like one of the

12:26.880 --> 12:33.760
skills that you have to master is being able to translate technical requirements into simple

12:33.760 --> 12:38.880
task. And that's really like what it is about. When you get to talk to machine learning engineers

12:38.880 --> 12:44.400
or data scientists about what they want, what the image in that the task should be about and

12:44.400 --> 12:50.880
how to handle it and so on. It can be very confusing and it can go like in a different places

12:50.880 --> 12:58.560
at the same time. So Jager is to get all these requirements and put them on paper and get Jager,

12:58.560 --> 13:04.400
okay, what do they really want and make it as simple as possible when you translate that into

13:04.400 --> 13:12.480
guidelines that's going to be helping the team getting trained on the task. So really,

13:12.480 --> 13:19.760
that's actually something I learned doing over the years is that you have to translate,

13:19.760 --> 13:26.960
you have to think as a labeler that has no technical background and tell them what they need to do.

13:26.960 --> 13:34.640
And one thing I really like doing with the labelers is once they have worked on a product for months,

13:35.680 --> 13:41.120
giving them more context about why they are doing that is very important because that give them

13:41.120 --> 13:46.640
the purpose of why they are doing this task on a daily basis. Once the product has been released

13:46.640 --> 13:53.040
publicly and there is like press release or a website talking about it, I love sending that

13:53.040 --> 13:58.000
to the laboring team that worked on it so that they really understand and they can really see

13:58.000 --> 14:04.960
and share like the success of the product. To help them be part of the team. Exactly.

14:04.960 --> 14:12.080
Can you maybe give us an example of, you know, when you think of kind of the most complex

14:12.080 --> 14:18.400
labeling tasks that you've tackled, give us an example of one of those and some of the things

14:18.400 --> 14:26.320
that you did from a training and support perspective to help that team be successful.

14:26.320 --> 14:36.480
One of the most complex use cases I worked on was like touching to augmented reality. I worked on like

14:38.160 --> 14:44.400
J.J. about having an item that would be you would be able to see in your living room with like

14:44.400 --> 14:50.400
the real size to see if you would like to buy this couch or this lamp or this kettle and that

14:50.400 --> 14:58.640
was actually a very complex workflow. The task in itself was not super complex but on my end,

14:58.640 --> 15:03.920
you know, like on the labeling operation side of things that was very complicated because

15:03.920 --> 15:10.000
of the technology that we were using, we were not able to use any item that we had. We couldn't

15:10.000 --> 15:18.480
like for instance have some sort of spiky item going through that technology that would render

15:18.480 --> 15:25.840
this like a vision of the of this item. So there was like this like all selection of the items

15:25.840 --> 15:31.680
that could go through that technology that we were using and then you would have to after that

15:33.120 --> 15:39.040
talk with the product management team that had like all these like dates to release all these

15:39.040 --> 15:44.960
products so that they could be available on the marketplace and so we had to juggle all of

15:44.960 --> 15:50.800
this like huge volume and at the same time quality issues that were happening. On the top of that

15:50.800 --> 15:57.680
once there was the ear reproduction of the item like some of them were not good at all and that

15:57.680 --> 16:02.560
couldn't be publicly released on the website so we had to go through some quality control.

16:02.560 --> 16:11.920
Anyway, the entire workflow was very complex and was handled by a lot of different stakeholders,

16:11.920 --> 16:20.720
a lot of different teams inside and outside of the company and that was pretty stressful to handle

16:20.720 --> 16:29.040
but that worked really well in gym. It sounds like one of the takeaways there is that

16:30.240 --> 16:38.720
just the place of labeling in the overall kind of process of delivering a product it's

16:38.720 --> 16:44.720
you know maybe easy to think of hey you know before you start this project you've got this big

16:44.720 --> 16:50.560
data set you send it off to some labelers you know you get back you know a label data set and then

16:50.560 --> 16:57.120
you kind of start with the product of productizing or building whatever you want but it sounds like

16:57.120 --> 17:02.800
at least in the case of this workflow that you're describing you were kind of in the loop of

17:02.800 --> 17:11.200
productizing this ARVR experience and you know the the things that you were the challenges that you

17:11.200 --> 17:17.280
were experiencing just related to the complexity of delivering the product overall.

17:17.280 --> 17:23.280
Yeah that's that's very true and I think that's like really the the core of the data labeling

17:23.280 --> 17:29.360
operation team is that is that we are in the middle we are not we can be at the start of it but

17:29.360 --> 17:34.160
there is always this idea that there is a product that's going to be released at the end and

17:34.160 --> 17:39.680
what does that mean is that as a data labeling operation person you are dealing with humans you are

17:39.680 --> 17:44.880
dealing with like you know a labeling team you are dealing with the product managers you are

17:44.880 --> 17:51.200
dealing like with so many people having their own requirements but also their own limitations

17:51.200 --> 17:55.840
and you have to juggle all of that to make sure that the product is going to be released on time

17:55.840 --> 18:04.320
and that's true whether or not you are data labeling operation team internally or you are just

18:04.320 --> 18:10.320
you know like these companies outsourcing all of that piece this is this is very central to the

18:10.320 --> 18:16.160
success of a product release for sure. You've mentioned data labeling operations a few times

18:16.160 --> 18:26.000
you know how how kind of ubiquitous and mature is that as a role a job title a function

18:26.000 --> 18:34.400
the most large organizations that are you know have a significant investment in ML and labeling

18:34.400 --> 18:42.640
you know have that team in place. That's a really good question I think that I was really at the

18:42.640 --> 18:49.840
early stage of that that journey like data labeling operation when I started I mean I got lucky

18:49.840 --> 18:57.360
right because basically there was no knowledge or degree in data labeling operation and so they

18:57.360 --> 19:05.520
were opening the doors to anyone who wanted to give it a try and so as the years go by now you get

19:05.520 --> 19:10.880
people who have been in the space for a few years like I've been in the space for the past seven years

19:10.880 --> 19:16.800
and that's the type of people that you want to have if you want to lead data labeling operation

19:16.800 --> 19:26.720
team at the big company and additionally like the complexity of the data labeling space not only

19:26.720 --> 19:31.920
in the ecosystem as I mentioned earlier there are so many players on the market right now but also

19:31.920 --> 19:39.920
the complexity of the labeling tasks themselves all of that have grown exponentially over the years

19:39.920 --> 19:47.040
and that's just like you you need people who are specialized in the domain to make the right

19:47.040 --> 19:54.960
decision but also to make decision very fast and that's still not completely I think understood

19:56.800 --> 20:01.600
but we're coming we're getting there I see more and more people with like you know a lot of

20:01.600 --> 20:06.800
experience getting hired to other places so there is this idea now that you're looking for people

20:06.800 --> 20:14.080
with experience in the data labeling but now you know when you start up or when you only start

20:14.080 --> 20:19.840
your journey you don't have that in house you I think it takes a little bit of time to to to

20:19.840 --> 20:26.000
realize that this is a nation and it's a short wall in the in the entire AI loop you mentioned that

20:26.000 --> 20:30.960
when you started there was no degree program is there now or have you seen like certifications or

20:30.960 --> 20:38.640
that kind of I know not yet but I think I think it's going to happen in the in the next few years

20:38.640 --> 20:45.840
I think it has to happen that has become its own specialty and and I really truly believe that

20:45.840 --> 20:53.520
it's going to happen soon so if you're in this role if you're the the data labeling ops team

20:53.520 --> 20:59.280
and you know you're at a larger company that has multiple projects and you're approached with a

20:59.280 --> 21:08.000
new project you know walk us through kind of the steps of onboarding a new a new project or initiative

21:08.000 --> 21:12.080
or customer however you would think about it what are the things you're thinking of what are the

21:12.080 --> 21:18.400
things you're asking them for and just kind of how do you think about kind of spinning up a new

21:18.400 --> 21:22.480
effort basically you need to talk to the machine learning engineers you need to talk to the

21:22.480 --> 21:28.720
scientists and understand their needs what are they looking to accomplish with that labeling task what

21:28.720 --> 21:36.480
is their model about what do they want to recognize or predict with that model that they are they

21:36.480 --> 21:42.480
want to get the data for that's really what's going to help make sure that you're going to get the

21:42.480 --> 21:48.320
right task to the laborer so that you can get the right data labored and then you're going to be

21:48.320 --> 21:53.280
able to feed your model and train it so really there is this discussion on like where they want to go

21:53.280 --> 21:58.960
and then once you frame it you talk about the task and either they have already an idea about the

21:58.960 --> 22:05.440
task or they don't they can just tell you you know I have 50,000 images of dresses and I want to

22:05.440 --> 22:11.520
recognize all the attributes on the dress do it good luck I need that for like in three months time

22:11.520 --> 22:18.080
and then you go about it and then so the idea is to show them the task that you're going to be

22:18.080 --> 22:24.880
creating the guidelines that will go with it but also like the examples that you're going to give

22:24.880 --> 22:31.200
because the the best way to train labeling team on a task is to show them example about how to

22:31.200 --> 22:39.440
train so about how to label a specific task so what I used to do for instance even at amazon is

22:39.440 --> 22:46.000
create my own task and then work on it myself label a few images myself to see if that was making

22:46.000 --> 22:51.280
sense if I was covering all the different use cases and once it was done I was submitting it to the

22:51.280 --> 22:56.160
machine learning team they were telling me if they like it or not if that works for them and then

22:56.160 --> 23:02.640
from there I would train the team and that goes back to what I was talking about which is feedback

23:02.640 --> 23:07.760
loop tell the machine learning engineers hey you're going to have to do some quality control

23:07.760 --> 23:15.040
after the first pass to see if what you're getting is what you want or not give feedback and so on

23:15.040 --> 23:22.560
and so on so JJ is to have like a great relationship with the technical team and just like you know

23:22.560 --> 23:29.360
give them in advance the knowledge get them used to the fact that it's not going to be one one

23:29.360 --> 23:36.240
of thing that's going to be a project that's going to be on and on that's going to be very repetitive

23:36.240 --> 23:42.320
but that we will be there to help them get there with high quality annotations and a lot of

23:42.320 --> 23:47.600
ways it sounds like a product management type of role like you're the labeling product manager

23:47.600 --> 23:54.160
yeah yeah I like that idea a lot of a lot of people doing labeling operations some like they end

23:54.160 --> 24:02.320
up also being product managers for machine learning products that's correct so you've you've developed

24:02.320 --> 24:11.680
this task and you've got this feedback loop you know it sounds like the task will often evolve

24:11.680 --> 24:17.680
quite a bit from what you originally thought it should be to you know what you what you do at scale

24:17.680 --> 24:22.480
can you talk a little bit about that evolution yeah I think it's very important to keep in mind that

24:22.480 --> 24:28.800
there will be a feedback loop and and that's what I was trying to to say earlier is that you know

24:28.800 --> 24:32.320
like you're you're going to have two types of feedback loops basically you're going to have the one

24:32.320 --> 24:36.960
that's going to be about training the laborers making sure they understand your requirements

24:36.960 --> 24:43.200
making sure that they are reaching the the right quality and once you get there you're going to get

24:43.200 --> 24:48.000
your data back and then what happens is that you're going to feed your model with that with that

24:48.000 --> 24:54.400
data and that's why you're going to realize that that your model is responding well to everything

24:54.400 --> 25:00.080
that's supposed to be doing or sometimes it's responding well to some areas but not to others

25:00.080 --> 25:04.720
and then in that case that's actually a feedback loop that's sent to the data science team

25:04.720 --> 25:09.520
so that they know that they need to be framed and reworked that task to cover those areas that

25:09.520 --> 25:15.120
were not working well when they tested their model and so again you get into another task that

25:15.120 --> 25:19.760
you're going to train the laborers on and you're going to give them another feedback loop and so on

25:19.760 --> 25:26.800
and so on so are there some common ways that tasks evolve I imagine you know if you've

25:27.520 --> 25:32.880
if you've done similar types of use cases you know an engineering team may you know

25:32.880 --> 25:37.120
habitually come to you and say I want this and you say no you really don't want that because

25:37.120 --> 25:42.800
you're going to end up changing it to to something else because you've just seen over and over

25:42.800 --> 25:47.760
it doesn't work the way that that they think but I'm wondering if there are examples of

25:47.760 --> 25:56.480
you know those kinds of evolutions or transitions where you know that a task starts out as

25:56.480 --> 26:03.440
as X and ends up evolving to Y for whatever reasons I would say yes I'm trying to think about an

26:03.440 --> 26:10.560
example but that's not coming to my mind right now but I I would say what what really blew my

26:10.560 --> 26:16.160
mind over the years is that I've seen a lot of different companies going after the same

26:16.160 --> 26:23.360
problem trying to solve it and they were doing it in a very different way which was also like very

26:24.160 --> 26:31.600
very intriguing for me because I was like I saw that okay you want to recognize that and

26:33.600 --> 26:37.760
the machine learning teams are going to be convinced that the way they are going about it is

26:37.760 --> 26:46.320
the right way and and and actually that's where like it creates like even more like complexity

26:46.320 --> 26:52.240
into that space is that there are like a lot of different ways to tackle a problem exactly the

26:52.240 --> 26:57.200
same problem so that I've seen a lot for sure so we've talked about setting up these tasks

26:59.120 --> 27:05.200
we've talked about the the training part is there an element of workforce selection

27:05.200 --> 27:13.360
that comes to bear when you're spinning up a new effort yes absolutely so as you like it depends

27:13.360 --> 27:20.080
on the task if you have a task that requires specific knowledge you want to find a workforce

27:20.080 --> 27:27.280
that's going to be able to get that type of special specialized people to work on the task whether

27:27.280 --> 27:31.840
or not it's to become labor laws or to be training the labor laws on the task

27:31.840 --> 27:40.400
that that's one now you can have also task that requires language skills and if you want to

27:40.400 --> 27:47.280
understand the context let's let's take the example of you know content moderation on on social

27:47.280 --> 27:53.360
major you can you you you want to do it on a lot of different languages not only in English so

27:53.360 --> 27:57.120
you're going to have to find a workforce that's going to be able to understand Spanish and

27:57.120 --> 28:05.200
Brazilian Portuguese and so on and because it's social major there is a cultural context to it

28:05.200 --> 28:11.920
it's not only knowing or understanding Spanish it's also understanding the context of the country

28:11.920 --> 28:18.560
right like why would they talk about this politician and and so on and so on and and so that's

28:18.560 --> 28:25.520
where like it becomes very tricky to have only one workforce to do all your needs if you have a

28:25.520 --> 28:30.640
lot of different needs you're going to have to have a portfolio of workforces that you're going to

28:30.640 --> 28:37.440
be obviously testing before partnering with them but that will be helping you with all your

28:37.440 --> 28:43.120
different data labeling needs and sometimes it's even like better to have workforces from

28:43.120 --> 28:47.920
different parts of the world because they're going to be able to see things with a different angle

28:47.920 --> 28:52.160
now when you look at the various labeling company websites they all

28:52.160 --> 29:00.080
you know portray themselves as solving all the problems you know with equal level of excellence

29:00.080 --> 29:06.400
and they all want to kind of be the one stop shop but it sounds like your experience is that

29:06.400 --> 29:13.440
that's not really the case and it does it shouldn't necessarily be the case I think that it was

29:13.440 --> 29:20.800
probably true a few years back when you were mentioning mechanical talk or like maybe there was

29:20.800 --> 29:27.120
like crowd flower at the time like it was just like the space was like very new there were

29:27.120 --> 29:32.640
very few players and and you had to go to one of them to make it work somehow or even you have

29:32.640 --> 29:38.080
the idea about having companies that were bridging their own in-house labeling tool because they

29:38.080 --> 29:44.080
couldn't find anything that was working for them on the market I mean even Elon Musk just said

29:44.080 --> 29:48.480
that on the podcast recently that they had to build their own data labeling platform so

29:48.480 --> 29:55.840
it's it's I in my experience I don't think it's true anymore because what happens is that

29:55.840 --> 30:02.960
companies are going with one data labeling tool and one workforce and they try and and we know

30:02.960 --> 30:07.920
why because it's so difficult to get all the species together it's so time consuming and

30:08.560 --> 30:12.800
like as I said earlier these people are data scientists they should be working on models they

30:12.800 --> 30:20.160
shouldn't be working on finding the right partners but they do that and then and then all of a sudden

30:20.160 --> 30:27.680
the quality drops all of a sudden the cost gets higher or the turnaround time is not good enough

30:27.680 --> 30:32.400
and then everything it's kind of like falling apart but you know you don't want to go through that

30:32.400 --> 30:40.800
process all over again it's it's so time consuming to find another another partner so I believe yes

30:40.800 --> 30:47.840
the JECO system is is is great right now it's crowded but in a good way meaning that there are

30:47.840 --> 30:54.240
so many options on the market that a company doesn't need to choose one option they can just play

30:54.240 --> 30:58.560
with them depending on what they need at the moment they need it depending on the model they're

30:58.560 --> 31:05.600
working on I think that we need to keep in mind that nowadays companies have not not one model in

31:05.600 --> 31:11.360
house they have hundreds of models that they need to work on with different formats and and and

31:11.360 --> 31:18.560
thinking that there will be one stop shop I think is is something that's going to be hard to to

31:18.560 --> 31:27.680
believe moving forward you mentioned that you've seen kind of this recurring pattern of when you're

31:27.680 --> 31:35.600
working with a vendor at some point the quality drops off and the turnaround time gets extended

31:35.600 --> 31:41.200
and that kind of thing is that is there something inherent about labeling the causes that to happen

31:41.200 --> 31:47.120
or is it more kind of just working with a vendor and they're really focused on the new customer and

31:47.120 --> 31:53.360
they kind of let the the older customers languish a little bit I think yeah part of it is working

31:53.360 --> 31:58.080
with human beings like it's you know like you're not like working with tech you're working with

31:58.080 --> 32:04.640
people and they have lives and they have issues and they get sick and you know so we have to take

32:04.640 --> 32:13.200
that into account again like the idea about having like this like data labeled very fast with very

32:13.200 --> 32:19.280
good quality it's going to be hard to maintain that over weeks and weeks just because

32:19.280 --> 32:27.200
you are dealing with human people and and human beings and most of the time this this like

32:27.200 --> 32:32.640
workforce labeling partners they are doing the best they can and they they want to do a good job

32:32.640 --> 32:37.600
and and that's just that sometimes it's very hard that's the nature of the business and I think

32:37.600 --> 32:45.440
we need to keep that in mind when we are using one of those partners is that I think you're you've kind

32:45.440 --> 32:54.480
of your your answer kind of suggests this but it is a big part of your experience in this label

32:54.480 --> 33:01.440
ops role helping you know engineers understand that there are humans on the other side of this

33:01.440 --> 33:07.200
API that you know the labeling companies kind of position themselves as like this API that

33:07.200 --> 33:12.400
abstracts the messiness of labeling do you think that that also abstracts away from the humans on

33:12.400 --> 33:17.120
the other side of those APIs and that's a big part of the role is helping them understand that

33:17.120 --> 33:24.800
I think it's trying to juggle like what's going on on like every side of the you know the workflow

33:24.800 --> 33:30.480
so yes it's like talking to machine learning engineers and and educating them on how it works and

33:30.480 --> 33:35.360
how quality is going to be rich and how quality is going to be maintained that it takes time

33:35.360 --> 33:40.960
but in the end they're going to gain from it so Jager that like you know they understand a

33:40.960 --> 33:47.440
bit more what's going on in this entire loop that's not only tech but are so human beings involved

33:47.440 --> 33:54.000
in the process and on the other end like trying also to juggle you know what's happening with

33:54.000 --> 34:00.160
the data labeling companies and and see how I can help them and that happens a lot that we have

34:00.160 --> 34:04.960
discussions with them about how they can have a better workflow how they can have a better

34:04.960 --> 34:11.520
QA process in place so that there is not a need for too many feedback loops so it's kind of like

34:11.520 --> 34:19.360
understanding what's happening you know in the entire workflow and find a way to make it work

34:19.360 --> 34:25.920
at the best the best the best you can if we haven't talked much about tooling uh obviously

34:25.920 --> 34:31.600
important part of the overall workflow how have you seen that evolve over the years

34:31.600 --> 34:37.440
when when I started a lot of the tasks were bound in boxes so really like you didn't have to have

34:37.440 --> 34:44.800
very high tech tooling to make it work into the machine learning world but over the years I've

34:44.800 --> 34:52.480
seen so many data labeling platform trying to become more sophisticated trying to respond to

34:52.480 --> 34:58.960
special needs from certain machine learning companies they have like very great features they

34:58.960 --> 35:05.200
can do segmentation they can do relationship between worlds like in a text it has become very

35:05.200 --> 35:13.040
sophisticated and all these companies are tacking in a different way I would say which is very

35:13.040 --> 35:22.080
interesting to see and they they are like pretty some of them are even like really good for certain

35:22.080 --> 35:30.480
verticals but not for others or certain format but not for others so definitely data labeling

35:30.480 --> 35:35.520
as become more and more complex and if you add on the top the new comments as I mentioned earlier

35:35.520 --> 35:42.400
about synthetic data or augmented data then it becomes even more complex so really there is a lot

35:43.120 --> 35:48.640
to play with and it's just a connection of being able to select the right one and to connect

35:48.640 --> 35:57.440
them with each other when you need it talk a little bit about measuring quality for labeling

35:57.440 --> 36:07.040
efforts so I mean you know quality everyone wants to reach 100% I I talk to people who are saying

36:07.040 --> 36:16.160
well I don't want anything else than 99 or 100% that's that's a that's a bit complicated to reach

36:16.160 --> 36:24.720
but the idea is to be able to check the quality and you have to do it regularly once once you

36:24.720 --> 36:28.880
able to check the quality of the work that has been done by the laborers what does that mean is

36:28.880 --> 36:34.160
that you're going to have a sample of your data that you're going to look at and you're going to

36:34.160 --> 36:39.920
look let's say you look at 100 images and you know 95 of them have been labeled correctly

36:39.920 --> 36:46.080
so you have a 99 95% accuracy rate you're happy with that right like how you're going to maintain

36:46.080 --> 36:52.080
that accuracy level weeks after weeks and I think again it goes back to what I was talking about

36:52.080 --> 36:57.440
which is the feedback loop you want to make sure that you keep an eye on the quality again you're

36:57.440 --> 37:03.440
working with people who are labeling even though they are using like performant tooling in the end

37:03.440 --> 37:08.960
if you don't have a good labeling workforce doing the labeling correctly the quality is going

37:08.960 --> 37:17.440
is not going to be good so so really like the idea is to being able to do the quality control

37:17.440 --> 37:22.560
regularly and make sure that if you see that something is dropping you are able to address it

37:22.560 --> 37:29.440
as soon as possible so that the laborers can retrain and can perform well moving forward and

37:29.440 --> 37:36.400
even correct the laborers that were done incorrectly in the past so yeah it goes back to this idea about

37:36.400 --> 37:48.000
this cycle of quality control and is that is that quality control being measured against

37:50.160 --> 37:56.160
you know kind of what's that process is it you know having internal folks spot check or

37:57.040 --> 38:04.560
you know where does that that come from yeah so everyone is going to get it in a different way but

38:04.560 --> 38:12.320
ideally I think as you mentioned earlier the internal you know laborers in a company are going to

38:12.320 --> 38:18.880
be the one with most of the knowledge and ideally you would use those people for QA you would use

38:18.880 --> 38:25.040
those people to check the quality of the work that has been outsourced to make sure that it's

38:25.040 --> 38:30.080
maintained but also to give some feedback and retrain more than anything else because

38:30.080 --> 38:36.800
cost wise it probably makes more sense to do it that way than to have like an army of people in

38:36.800 --> 38:44.240
house that would do the the whole labeling and the whole QA and are there established kind of norms

38:44.240 --> 38:48.640
about you know what percentage of labels you want a spot check or that kind of thing

38:49.600 --> 38:59.200
there are a lot of opinions on that what I've been taught over the years is that if you look at

38:59.200 --> 39:05.840
a hundred every every other day you're going to be able to have a good idea about what's going on

39:05.840 --> 39:11.680
even if it's like 10,000 images that have been labeled that's still going to give you a good idea

39:11.680 --> 39:16.800
about what's going on in your data sets okay so it sounds you know in some ways it's less about

39:17.520 --> 39:24.080
um you know establishing kind of statistical significance of sampling or anything like that

39:24.080 --> 39:32.640
more about just having a feel for how it's going yeah and it has to be done regularly so um

39:32.640 --> 39:37.600
obviously if you do that you know once a month you're not going to get a good idea about it but

39:37.600 --> 39:41.680
if you do it like every other day you're going to have a really good idea about what's going on

39:41.680 --> 39:51.840
definitely mm-hmm and I asked this question earlier I want to re-ask it you know when you see a drop

39:51.840 --> 40:00.640
in quality you know it sounds like one of the tools uh in your toolbox is training and feedback

40:00.640 --> 40:07.760
and and that kind of thing you know how often are you implementing strategies like you know

40:07.760 --> 40:14.800
aggregating labelers uh and taking a quorum that kind of thing versus you know training and

40:14.800 --> 40:20.640
what's the thought process around you know these kinds of strategies yeah absolutely that's a really

40:20.640 --> 40:26.720
good question uh definitely they're like different ways to go about um you know making sure that

40:26.720 --> 40:32.560
quality is going to be high so on one of the projects I worked on in the past the idea is to have

40:33.280 --> 40:39.840
we were like having uh several people on the same image at the same time and uh you know like

40:39.840 --> 40:44.160
if we had like three agreements on the way they were labeling if the three people were

40:44.160 --> 40:50.640
labeling the same way then we were considering it as correct even if you were not eyeballing the data

40:50.640 --> 40:58.480
that was delivered um and we were doing that as long as the quality was not great and was not

40:58.480 --> 41:04.560
maintained and once it was done we were dropping from like three people to two people and then from

41:04.560 --> 41:11.280
two people two people to one person and why we had to do that it's a question of budget right so

41:11.280 --> 41:19.760
you have to be able to balance um you're like search for like quality and and the money you have

41:19.760 --> 41:24.400
to spend on it right if you get three people per image obviously it's going to cost way more

41:24.400 --> 41:31.600
but that's also a good way about doing crowdsourcing right if you go into uh use mechanical

41:31.600 --> 41:37.440
torque or happen and you have three people on the same image even though you feel that the

41:37.440 --> 41:42.800
knowledge is probably you know you don't you're not sure if people know about what they are labeling

41:42.800 --> 41:50.400
you can have like certain degree of um certainty that this is correct if three people out of three

41:50.400 --> 41:55.040
are responding the same way so you're right they're like a lot of different ways to go about

41:55.040 --> 42:01.280
quality again depending on the complexity of the task the budget the turnaround time you're

42:01.280 --> 42:07.520
going to have to juggle all these options and find the best one for your your case how often is it

42:08.320 --> 42:17.840
you as the kind of data label ops on the customer side that is thinking about that and having

42:17.840 --> 42:24.880
to come up with the solution versus um you know the vendor that is you know promising to kind

42:24.880 --> 42:29.440
of manage the quality for you like how hands-on does quality management need to be

42:29.440 --> 42:36.240
I mean I'm pretty hands-on I would say I think I think that's where also it's one of the strengths of

42:36.240 --> 42:44.480
the data labeling oppression people is that they are um they can be like very objective in the way

42:44.480 --> 42:53.680
of doing things um so ideally like I mean I was the one proposing and there is this idea about

42:53.680 --> 42:58.960
also rejecting right like understand how much it's going to cost and how long it's going to take

42:58.960 --> 43:04.400
and they're like those three matrix that are really important that help you measure if your

43:04.400 --> 43:09.120
data labeling project have been successful or not uh it's obviously the quality of the data

43:10.240 --> 43:16.080
the turnaround time how fast they can deliver uh I have customers asking for a five minute turnaround

43:16.080 --> 43:21.440
time how do you get high quality with a five minute turnaround time when you have people who are trained

43:21.440 --> 43:26.720
and that are like on the other side of the world with like the time difference and so on um and

43:26.720 --> 43:33.920
then you have the budget how much money are you able to spend on data labeling and so um you have

43:33.920 --> 43:39.680
to take the three matrix into consideration each time that you are you know starting a data

43:39.680 --> 43:44.960
labeling project that's that's the only way you can understand fully what you want to do about it

43:44.960 --> 43:53.760
and in other areas of of tech and I guess life you have this classic like uh time cost quality

43:53.760 --> 44:02.160
pick any two does that idea recur in uh in labeling well I believe you can you you can reach three of

44:02.160 --> 44:07.440
them but obviously you're right like depending on the solution yes you're going to have to to

44:07.440 --> 44:13.600
privilege which of those two are the most important ones to you and then you you might be able to

44:13.600 --> 44:18.960
reach the third one as well but you need to be more flexible on the third one so for instance

44:18.960 --> 44:24.560
I'm going to give you an example if you use crowdsourcing uh for your labeling it's going to be

44:24.560 --> 44:32.160
super cheap uh you're going to have a fast turnaround time and quality hmm you're not 100% sure

44:32.160 --> 44:40.960
about it uh if you have an internal team doing the labeling super high quality but also super expensive

44:40.960 --> 44:46.800
and uh and the fast turnaround time it depends on the size of your team if you have five people

44:46.800 --> 44:51.760
they can do only what they can do you know during that day so they might not have a big volume

44:51.760 --> 44:58.720
done within 24 hours or week or so um so yes you're right each time there is like there are like

44:58.720 --> 45:04.400
several options and you have to write to think about what matters to you the most I love to get

45:04.400 --> 45:11.200
your take on the various ethical considerations with regards to labeling particularly with

45:11.200 --> 45:22.800
uh many of the the labeling workforces being uh remote and with um you know workforces that are

45:22.800 --> 45:31.680
used so much uh lower kind of income than you know in the in western countries um there have been

45:31.680 --> 45:38.080
some recent articles uh there's a wired article uh not wired it actually MIT tech review article by

45:38.080 --> 45:43.840
Karen how talking about how uh one of the label labeling companies was kind of taking about

45:43.840 --> 45:52.960
taking advantage of economic turmoil and Venezuela um and uh uh his Facebook is was getting sued

45:52.960 --> 46:00.160
by a labeling company in Kenya I think I watch how you kind of thought about and managed the various

46:00.160 --> 46:05.200
ethical considerations before answering your question I think I would like to ask two questions

46:05.200 --> 46:12.560
the first one is is like how does it work for outsourcing in general not only for data labeling but

46:12.560 --> 46:18.560
if you think about recycling we are doing that already in other domain in other verticals

46:19.120 --> 46:24.160
are we comfortable with it do we need to revisit but that's that's the bigger discussion that's

46:24.160 --> 46:30.880
broader discussion that we should probably have as well the second one is you're probably mentioning

46:30.880 --> 46:35.280
so data labeling in general but I think that the article was also mentioning content moderation

46:35.280 --> 46:40.000
because you can have like some disturbing content and that might affect you know psychologically

46:40.000 --> 46:49.200
some people um is it needed do we need content moderation I think as a parent myself I I want to

46:49.200 --> 46:54.640
feel that the internet is a bit safer for my kids uh and I want to have a choice to you know

46:54.640 --> 47:01.600
protect them if I can so in my view it's very important that we keep doing content moderation

47:02.320 --> 47:08.320
uh not not to answer and and one thing I would like to add is that I yes content moderation has

47:08.320 --> 47:14.400
been outsourced but it's not entirely outsourced I know for a fact that content moderation is

47:14.400 --> 47:23.120
currently done uh in the United States and also in Europe um so um the question and I've done

47:23.120 --> 47:29.360
I mean I when I work my first job I was not doing content moderation but I had some pretty

47:29.360 --> 47:35.840
disturbing things when I was doing the job and so you know it's it's unfortunately it's part of

47:35.840 --> 47:41.440
like the low income jobs in the data labeling space to jump in I think you know you're already

47:41.440 --> 47:50.000
raising uh uh several important issues one I think is that um you know there are

47:50.000 --> 47:58.000
multitude of potential issues it's not just one issue that and it's not you know solely

47:58.720 --> 48:03.600
you know outsourced versus insourced there's a lot of complexity to it uh but I also thought the

48:03.600 --> 48:12.640
first point you made around you know the questions in labeling and and label an outsourced labeling

48:12.640 --> 48:18.560
in particular are the same as other kinds of outsourcing and even more broadly

48:18.560 --> 48:25.920
um other types of commerce like the first thing I thought of was like in in coffee we've got fair

48:25.920 --> 48:33.040
trade right you know uh and so you know maybe the future is like fair trade labeling or something

48:33.040 --> 48:38.640
like that. Absolutely absolutely I think that's uh that's a great comment that you're making right

48:38.640 --> 48:43.680
now I think that that's the future and that's what I was going to talk about is that I

48:43.680 --> 48:50.800
think that jays that yes content moderation is needed but how do you do it is what needs to be

48:50.800 --> 48:57.760
improved and definitely um uh throughout like the years I've seen companies taking action in that

48:57.760 --> 49:03.920
in that field so for instance um they're going to be having like a therapist on site so that

49:03.920 --> 49:08.320
people who feel like they need to talk to someone they can straight away go and talk to that person

49:08.320 --> 49:14.800
uh they can also uh do content moderation only on a voluntary basis it's not something you're not

49:14.800 --> 49:20.480
going to lose your job if you don't want to do it you have the choice um and these people also

49:20.480 --> 49:26.160
work less hours than other regular laborers working on regular labeling tasks just because it's a

49:26.160 --> 49:32.720
way to work on my stack okay you're doing a very very difficult job and you don't need to work you

49:32.720 --> 49:38.640
know as many hours as as the other people are doing uh other tasks I think it's the beginning and

49:38.640 --> 49:45.120
every company has their own vision on what it should look like but I've seen a lot of companies

49:45.600 --> 49:52.080
especially feng um making decisions to work only with companies that have made that type of

49:52.080 --> 49:57.600
efforts for their own workers and you're right you're right that I I believe that the future is going

49:57.600 --> 50:03.760
to be that there will be some sort of committee uh that would like you know um

50:04.560 --> 50:11.200
eject the rules in terms of fair data labeling uh how does that work how you protect the workers

50:11.200 --> 50:15.280
and so on and and that's definitely something that I would like to see happening

50:16.080 --> 50:22.080
if anything the unifying thread between you know the various aspects of this conversation

50:22.080 --> 50:27.840
is recognizing the humanity of the folks that are doing the labeling and the implications of that

50:27.840 --> 50:32.480
both from your process as well as the you know now the ethical considerations we're discussing

50:33.120 --> 50:40.720
yeah definitely I one thing I would like to add to that is that um you know all these people like

50:40.720 --> 50:46.720
a lot of them are not you know educated they don't have like degrees and and that's their way

50:46.720 --> 50:53.840
also to go and start having like an education uh around IT how to use a computer how to label

50:53.840 --> 51:00.400
and a lot of the companies I've been working with us for the years have you know promoted

51:00.400 --> 51:06.080
internally all these people from doing the labeling to doing quality control to being teamly

51:06.080 --> 51:12.080
to being program manager so there is like all this like new industry that's going to generate

51:12.080 --> 51:21.120
you know educated people that we'll be able to get like um you know good salaries and and and

51:21.120 --> 51:29.680
grow into their career so I I want I was one of them even if uh if uh I was uh I was doing the same

51:29.680 --> 51:35.680
thing but in the United States but I started you know at at that level and then I went up so I

51:35.680 --> 51:44.240
think that's very important also to to talk about that uh what do you see as the future of data

51:44.240 --> 51:51.360
label operations I think that the ecosystem needs to get unified I think that it's it's very

51:53.120 --> 52:00.400
there are like so many players that it's just like it's going to be hard to moving forward for

52:00.400 --> 52:06.800
company going into machine learning to find their way uh even though they're incredible um

52:06.800 --> 52:12.960
tools on the on the market right now so that's one so unifying the ecosystem is is a very important

52:12.960 --> 52:18.960
one and uh for the role in itself the data labeling operation I think that we're going to see more

52:18.960 --> 52:27.040
and more of data labeling operation people uh hired uh even in smaller companies or new companies

52:27.040 --> 52:33.120
going into the the journey instead of you know having uh only machine learning engineers and and

52:33.120 --> 52:39.520
think okay we're good we can start our journey there will be this idea that um other non-technical

52:39.520 --> 52:45.840
people are really um important to the journey well Audrey thanks so much for joining us and sharing

52:45.840 --> 52:51.920
a bit of your wealth of experience and labeling well thank you I was very honoured to be on your

52:51.920 --> 52:59.840
podcast thank you Sam thank you

53:21.920 --> 53:28.800
you
