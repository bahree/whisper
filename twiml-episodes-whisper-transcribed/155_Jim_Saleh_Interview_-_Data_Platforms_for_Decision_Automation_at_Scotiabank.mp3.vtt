00:00.000 --> 00:16.320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

00:16.320 --> 00:21.480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:21.480 --> 00:31.860
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:31.860 --> 00:38.020
This week we present a series of shows recorded at the Pego World Conference in Las Vegas.

00:38.020 --> 00:42.660
The theme of the conference was automation, particularly in service of creating enhanced

00:42.660 --> 00:45.420
customer experiences.

00:45.420 --> 00:51.160
In this episode I'm joined by Jim Salah, Senior Director of Process and Decision Automation

00:51.160 --> 00:53.000
at Scotiabank.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.960
Jim is tasked with helping the bank transition from a world where customer interactions are

00:56.960 --> 01:03.200
based on historical analysis to one where they're based on real-time decisioning and automation.

01:03.200 --> 01:08.400
In our conversation we discuss what's required to deliver real-time decisioning starting from

01:08.400 --> 01:11.400
the ground up with the data platform.

01:11.400 --> 01:16.840
In this vein we explore topics like data lakes, data warehouses, integration and more,

01:16.840 --> 01:21.120
and the effort required to take advantage of these.

01:21.120 --> 01:25.360
Before we jump into the interview, I'd like to send a huge thanks to our friends at Pego

01:25.360 --> 01:30.080
Systems for hosting me at Pego World and sponsoring this series.

01:30.080 --> 01:33.960
One of the great announcements coming out of the conference was Pego Systems' new

01:33.960 --> 01:38.400
self-optimizing AI-powered marketing capabilities.

01:38.400 --> 01:43.460
This is a really interesting offering designed to reduce marketers dependence on traditional

01:43.460 --> 01:50.840
segment-based campaigns and transition them towards real-time one-to-one customer engagement.

01:50.840 --> 01:55.560
These new capabilities will be available as part of their new Pego Infinity platform,

01:55.560 --> 01:58.320
which was also announced at the event.

01:58.320 --> 02:03.320
For more info on Pego Infinity, head to Pego.com-slash-infinity.

02:03.320 --> 02:07.520
Alright, let's do it.

02:07.520 --> 02:15.640
Alright everyone, I am here at Pego World in Las Vegas and I have the pleasure of being

02:15.640 --> 02:21.880
seated with Jim Salah. Jim is the Senior Director of Process and Decision Automation at Scotiabank.

02:21.880 --> 02:24.720
Jim, welcome to this week in Machine Learning and AI.

02:24.720 --> 02:25.720
Thank you very much.

02:25.720 --> 02:26.720
Happy to be here.

02:26.720 --> 02:27.720
Fantastic.

02:27.720 --> 02:31.560
Why don't we get started by having you tell us a little bit about your background?

02:31.560 --> 02:35.920
I understand you've got a long history in this space of decision automation.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.160
Sure, decision-impressed automation.

02:38.160 --> 02:39.160
Sure.

02:39.160 --> 02:46.880
So I'm 30 years in IT, 31 years in IT, and I've been implementing a large-scale automation

02:46.880 --> 02:50.160
systems pretty much that whole time.

02:50.160 --> 02:55.760
So I've kind of watched the industry grow and change for many years.

02:55.760 --> 03:00.600
Part of my background actually does involve some fairly heavy data modeling in the financial

03:00.600 --> 03:05.080
services industry and balance sheet analytics and things like that, so mathematical models

03:05.080 --> 03:08.240
and the whole world of AI has kind of just grown up around me.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.520
And I've seen quite a bit of the change.

03:10.520 --> 03:18.960
I've spent probably the last three years or so focused a little bit more on actual real

03:18.960 --> 03:24.360
time decisioning, as part of my practice of process and decision automation.

03:24.360 --> 03:30.360
And the reason these two are together is that the bank is very focused not just on better

03:30.360 --> 03:36.040
analytics and better decisions, but on actionable decisions and actually being able to do something

03:36.040 --> 03:37.520
with those.

03:37.520 --> 03:43.880
So we've really kind of strategically brought those things together with the intent of making

03:43.880 --> 03:47.720
better decisions and offering better advice and being able to actually follow through with

03:47.720 --> 03:48.720
the customer.

03:48.720 --> 03:49.720
Okay, awesome.

03:49.720 --> 03:55.800
And so for folks that aren't familiar with Scotiabank, tell us about it's a bank, but tell

03:55.800 --> 04:01.320
us about Scotiabank and maybe a little bit of Scotiabank journey with process and decision

04:01.320 --> 04:02.320
automation.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.320
Sure.

04:03.320 --> 04:04.320
Okay.

04:04.320 --> 04:11.280
As a Canadian bank, we're based in Toronto, we're in over 50 countries throughout the

04:11.280 --> 04:12.280
world.

04:12.280 --> 04:19.400
We're very heavily invested in Latin and Central America and South America as well obviously

04:19.400 --> 04:21.480
as Canada.

04:21.480 --> 04:26.800
And really our businesses on a major growth curve in the Americas in general, not just

04:26.800 --> 04:28.840
Canada.

04:28.840 --> 04:35.840
We've been, you know, like many banks traditionally, we've been doing kind of segment oriented historical

04:35.840 --> 04:43.200
analytics and, you know, we use those analytics primarily to make offers to our clients.

04:43.200 --> 04:51.360
Over the last few years, we started the curve of automation of work and automation of

04:51.360 --> 04:55.240
processes and kind of six sigma approach to things.

04:55.240 --> 05:01.360
And along with that, we through our work with Pega, we actually started using their real

05:01.360 --> 05:04.520
time decision, which is integrated with their process engine.

05:04.520 --> 05:10.200
And so what we're finding is along with, you know, better real time decisions, and I'll

05:10.200 --> 05:13.560
talk about that in a second, but along with better real time decisions, we actually are

05:13.560 --> 05:17.760
able to action things and, you know, drive work in our back end system.

05:17.760 --> 05:23.320
So as an example, you know, when an offer is taken up, we can actually automate the process

05:23.320 --> 05:29.160
of onboarding that product or that client or whatever it is that came out of the offer.

05:29.160 --> 05:36.760
We have, you know, we've started to move from offers that are, as I said, based on kind

05:36.760 --> 05:42.560
of batch data and historical data and, you know, the data on our existing systems.

05:42.560 --> 05:45.720
And we've started to augment them with more real time data.

05:45.720 --> 05:51.480
So streaming data from various, you know, social media and websites and things like that.

05:51.480 --> 05:56.040
And what it's giving us is the ability to make a more fulsome decision on behalf of the

05:56.040 --> 05:57.040
client.

05:57.040 --> 06:03.080
So, you know, the example I give people is traditionally, by the time an offer was actually

06:03.080 --> 06:09.160
presented to a client, it may be based on data that is weeks to even over a month old.

06:09.160 --> 06:14.040
The offer itself could be weeks old because the cycle time to create those offers was,

06:14.040 --> 06:15.320
you know, long.

06:15.320 --> 06:18.800
And with the new tools that are coming out in the market, we've got the ability to be

06:18.800 --> 06:25.640
much more agile. They bring the data model and the decision strategies together in one

06:25.640 --> 06:34.080
place and make it much simpler to integrate your data and work with your strategies.

06:34.080 --> 06:38.760
And so what we're now finding is that incorporating real time data and the faster turnaround

06:38.760 --> 06:44.640
time to be able to, you know, change offers, create offers, change other decisions is

06:44.640 --> 06:49.800
giving us the ability to, you know, be a more active participant in the conversation

06:49.800 --> 06:52.720
with the client and bring them more relevant offers.

06:52.720 --> 06:57.720
Okay, great. I'm really glad to hear you brooch the issue of data because that's something

06:57.720 --> 07:04.480
I've been wondering about over the course of the past couple of days here at the conference.

07:04.480 --> 07:09.880
There are a lot of interesting things happening in terms of, you know, the real time offers

07:09.880 --> 07:14.840
and things like that that have been discussed in the keynotes. And one of the questions

07:14.840 --> 07:19.680
running along in the back of my mind is, you know, what's really required to make this

07:19.680 --> 07:24.960
happen and what are all the integration points and, you know, what kind of data does the

07:24.960 --> 07:31.640
customer have to have access to and does, you know, in what ways it strikes me that

07:31.640 --> 07:37.120
at least to some degree putting these kinds of processes in place would help them enhance

07:37.120 --> 07:38.120
their data.

07:38.120 --> 07:45.360
Absolutely. And let's just dive into your experiences around the data side of this.

07:45.360 --> 07:46.360
Sure.

07:46.360 --> 07:50.800
So, you know, as I said, a lot of this is driven by the quality of the data that you have

07:50.800 --> 07:56.360
about your customers and traditionally, you know, large institutions have kind of taken

07:56.360 --> 08:02.440
a data mining data warehouse approach to and using segmentation to look at their clients.

08:02.440 --> 08:07.680
And that's great. You get a certain amount of information. You know your client from

08:07.680 --> 08:11.080
patterns. They're like this. They're, you know, they're like other people that we've

08:11.080 --> 08:16.320
worked with. What we're trying to do now is to get more down to an individual and a

08:16.320 --> 08:21.960
behavioral understanding of our clients. So we're, you know, and this is a multi-year

08:21.960 --> 08:24.360
journey. You don't do this overnight, obviously.

08:24.360 --> 08:30.560
And is that, if I can interrupt, is that fundamentally that individual view of the customer fundamentally

08:30.560 --> 08:34.520
at odds with the notion of a data warehouse?

08:34.520 --> 08:38.880
I would say that you're not going to achieve it with a data warehouse. Data warehouses

08:38.880 --> 08:43.880
are historical data by nature. And what we're trying to do, we certainly still embrace

08:43.880 --> 08:48.840
the data that we have historically about our clients and the data that we, you know, accumulate

08:48.840 --> 08:53.080
in doing our day-to-day business with our clients. That's still very important. And, you

08:53.080 --> 08:58.760
know, without that, you can't make good decisions. However, beyond that, we're now trying to

08:58.760 --> 09:04.560
reach out into, you know, partner networks, understanding, you know, not just things like

09:04.560 --> 09:11.120
account balances, you know, basic demographics, but transaction patterns, deposit patterns,

09:11.120 --> 09:16.640
payment patterns. And then beyond that, you know, social media, things that they're doing

09:16.640 --> 09:23.240
online. An example might be, you know, you want to make an offer to a client for a credit

09:23.240 --> 09:26.240
card. That's great.

09:26.240 --> 09:30.400
Wouldn't it be interesting to know that your client travels a lot, or is, in fact, traveling

09:30.400 --> 09:37.320
as, in fact, planning a major travel event right now? If you see them online doing foreign

09:37.320 --> 09:43.480
currency rate checks or online looking for airline tickets, well, that might change your

09:43.480 --> 09:50.560
offer from, you know, an affinity points to something related with travel benefits, things

09:50.560 --> 09:52.120
like that will happen, okay?

09:52.120 --> 09:59.720
Actually, that example resonates with me quite strongly because I do travel a lot. And

09:59.720 --> 10:04.640
when I see, you know, I get the credit card offers like everyone else does. And I, when

10:04.640 --> 10:08.960
I see one that is not, has no kind of points associated with it or something like, what

10:08.960 --> 10:12.600
are they thinking? Why would you, why would I even do this exactly?

10:12.600 --> 10:17.080
So if on top of that, you know that your, your bank understands a little bit about your

10:17.080 --> 10:22.600
life and is making offers that are more relevant to you, then, you know, your affinity to the

10:22.600 --> 10:28.760
bank grows. So, you know, one of the speakers at the conference yesterday was talking about,

10:28.760 --> 10:32.920
you know, customer satisfaction. We've got to move beyond customer satisfaction because

10:32.920 --> 10:37.760
everyone is satisfying customers. And, you know, a satisfied customer does not necessarily

10:37.760 --> 10:42.600
mean a customer that's going to stay with you. You've got to kind of go beyond that. And,

10:42.600 --> 10:49.040
you know, especially the, the changing demographics of our customer base, people expect us to

10:49.040 --> 10:54.120
know more about them. It's, it's not even a question of, you know, telling us about themselves.

10:54.120 --> 10:59.120
They expect you to just know these things. And so, and it goes beyond offers, in fact.

10:59.120 --> 11:06.040
So if you think about it, being able to give your customer a nudge because you see that

11:06.040 --> 11:09.960
they're getting into a situation where they may have a check bounce, you, you're seeing

11:09.960 --> 11:13.840
the patterns of deposits and expenditures, maybe even the patterns of things that are coming

11:13.840 --> 11:18.200
in on credit cards. And you know, you know, you've got a payment coming do. You really need

11:18.200 --> 11:22.600
to think about making that payment to avoid a late charge. Those kinds of nudges are considered

11:22.600 --> 11:27.640
value add by clients. So, being able to say things like that actually makes you more of a,

11:29.480 --> 11:34.840
a source of financial advice, more of a partner than just a bank selling them products. So,

11:34.840 --> 11:42.360
that's kind of the next wave of what we're hoping to get into is more value add or advice based

11:42.360 --> 11:48.040
interactions with our clients. And that kind of goes hand in glove with the automation of work

11:49.000 --> 11:53.800
because if you think about it, where, where the tendency is to automate the repetitive tasks

11:53.800 --> 11:58.600
that we do for our clients. And what that does is it frees our people up to be better financial

11:58.600 --> 12:03.560
advisors. If you add the intelligence behind that to, you know, make more pertinent offers,

12:03.560 --> 12:10.120
give nudges to your customers, then it changes the transaction between the bank and the customer

12:10.120 --> 12:15.960
from one of just order taking and fulfilling requests to one of actually offering advice and

12:15.960 --> 12:20.520
engaging the client. That's the direction we're trying to go with analytics and decisioning.

12:21.480 --> 12:29.160
And so, you mentioned pulling in different types of data, transactional, historical transactional

12:29.160 --> 12:36.040
data, social streaming real-time. When I hear this type of data mix, I start to think of data

12:36.040 --> 12:41.480
like, does that play into it at all for you? It does. You know, we don't necessarily use the

12:41.480 --> 12:47.560
term data lake for, but for sure there is the idea of, you know, gathering data. And in fact,

12:47.560 --> 12:52.920
by the way, the data that we gather includes the customer journeys that we're doing through the

12:52.920 --> 12:57.320
process automation of the decisions and the, you know, interaction history that we have with

12:57.320 --> 13:02.840
the client through making offers and giving nudges. So, all of the data that we're getting from

13:02.840 --> 13:08.120
all these different sources, including the data that we transact with the customer on a

13:08.120 --> 13:14.360
day-to-day basis is being captured and being in some ways curated for different uses and

13:14.360 --> 13:18.920
different purposes. And, you know, one of the things that we're curating for is making better

13:18.920 --> 13:24.680
decisions and offering our clients better services and products. So, yes, the concept of a data lake

13:24.680 --> 13:31.400
definitely plays a key role in this. And in some ways, it's at the base of the pyramid of

13:31.400 --> 13:36.920
value-add decision. Because I like to say that, you know, it all starts with data from your own

13:36.920 --> 13:42.360
backend systems and real-time data and all these things. And it goes up to, you know, kind of

13:42.360 --> 13:47.560
understanding insights and intents about your client, knowing, you know, what the most probable

13:47.560 --> 13:53.560
next interaction is going to be with your client. Or having the insights to say, I understand where

13:53.560 --> 13:59.560
they are in their life or in their financial situation and I can therefore make better offers to

13:59.560 --> 14:06.840
them or interact with them more intelligently. So, it goes from data to intents and insights

14:06.840 --> 14:12.360
up to decisions and then up to offers and actions. So, the top of the pyramid is actually doing

14:12.360 --> 14:20.280
something for your client. I got to say that when I'm here and I hear your vent you and, you know,

14:20.280 --> 14:27.080
other banks have presented, telcos have presented. You've all described this world that sounds,

14:27.080 --> 14:32.200
you know, awesome. Like the companies that I'm dealing with know what I'm going to need

14:33.000 --> 14:38.360
before I express the need or even, you know, as I'm contacting them. I don't feel like any of

14:38.360 --> 14:43.800
the companies I do business with actually do that. Is it, you know, just where we are in kind

14:43.800 --> 14:50.760
of the maturity cycle? Is it that I'm just working with? I have the wrong banks and telcos and,

14:50.760 --> 14:56.520
you know, all of that. Is it that this stuff is being, is it currently deployed in like small

14:56.520 --> 15:02.760
numbers today? That's a very good question. So, for sure we're on a journey. Some of the presenters

15:02.760 --> 15:06.920
today we're talking about having been working on these things for 10 years. Again, this is not

15:06.920 --> 15:12.920
something you, you can create the roadmap. You can have the concepts. It actually takes a great

15:12.920 --> 15:19.160
deal of work by many different groups around the bank to make these things happen. So, as I said,

15:19.160 --> 15:25.880
we're, we're right now in a period where, you know, there's a lot of creation of new technologies.

15:25.880 --> 15:30.280
These things are coming up all the time. You've got things like, you know, transcription,

15:30.280 --> 15:37.240
voice transcription, natural language processing, sentiment analysis. You've got the tools are

15:37.240 --> 15:45.400
coming available now. At the moment, many of these tools are still kind of here and there. You've

15:45.400 --> 15:49.400
got to figure out how to work with them, figure out how to integrate them into your ecosystem

15:49.400 --> 15:55.320
and into your architecture. So, some of it is just that because of the level of maturity of these

15:55.320 --> 16:01.560
tools, it takes a lot of work and a lot of, you know, experimentation to use these technologies.

16:01.560 --> 16:07.000
Now, what I think is going to happen is the creative process will continue. There will begin to

16:07.000 --> 16:12.360
be consolidation and you'll start to see platforms and actually Pega is one of those platforms that

16:12.360 --> 16:18.520
saying, we've got the core decision and capability and we've got the core of being able to do work.

16:19.080 --> 16:24.040
They're integrating right now with all of these other technologies and it takes work and it takes

16:24.040 --> 16:29.800
time and getting your data layer really nailed down takes time and work and a lot of analysis.

16:29.800 --> 16:34.120
There's data scientists and data engineers working flat out on that at our bank.

16:34.120 --> 16:40.440
And then what's going to start to happen is we've got pockets of success areas where we're doing

16:40.440 --> 16:45.960
this and we're experimenting in other areas. So, you know, we're talking about how to do things

16:45.960 --> 16:51.400
in customer service, how to do things in the world of collections or fraud. We're not yet at a

16:51.400 --> 16:57.000
point where we're just doing it full out, but we are definitely focusing on it and moving in that

16:57.000 --> 17:02.360
direction. So, you mentioned some of your data science teams and data engineering teams.

17:02.360 --> 17:08.680
What are they focused on now to try to help the enterprise get to this broader vision of

17:09.240 --> 17:13.640
real-time decision automation? Right. What are their big challenges? I think

17:14.520 --> 17:18.920
master data management is definitely big challenge like knowing that you've got the right copy

17:18.920 --> 17:25.400
of every field of data you have on your customers. You know, as I said, data lineage or data

17:25.400 --> 17:29.240
provenance, making sure that you understand where data came from, where the roots of it are,

17:29.240 --> 17:34.040
so that you use it correctly. These are some of the industry wide challenges that I think people

17:34.040 --> 17:38.840
are going through. And then, quite frankly, learning the new technologies that allow us to work with

17:38.840 --> 17:43.800
data in more agile and more real-time ways. You're not going to do this with classic relational

17:43.800 --> 17:48.280
databases. There are new technologies that are coming up and the banks adopting them. Well,

17:48.280 --> 17:54.760
industry is adopting those. So, I think the discipline of data engineering and data sciences

17:54.760 --> 17:59.640
is, again, evolving and growing, but it's definitely reaching a level of maturity where there

17:59.640 --> 18:04.280
are experts in the field. And there is real thought leadership. It's not, you know, guys like me

18:04.280 --> 18:09.000
going in and saying, I'm going to invent data engineering. It's there. It's a university discipline

18:09.000 --> 18:15.960
and we get to benefit from that now. For sure, there's a road map ahead of us to really nail down

18:15.960 --> 18:23.320
our data challenges. What are some of the technologies that are kind of on your radar at that data

18:23.320 --> 18:29.720
layer for helping you get to? Yeah. So, I mean, all the classic ones, you know, the Hadoop type

18:30.360 --> 18:36.760
data tools. Well, let's put it this way. We're looking at all sorts of different technologies

18:36.760 --> 18:41.960
that probably don't want to talk about the ones we're specifically looking at. But a lot of the

18:41.960 --> 18:47.400
you know, the cloud-based tools and the big data tools where we're investigating many of those

18:47.400 --> 18:53.800
and trying to choose the right ones for our mission. You mentioned cloud. There's been historically

18:53.800 --> 18:59.240
hesitation on the part of large enterprises, particularly banks and others to embrace cloud.

19:00.280 --> 19:05.400
I'm curious what if you can comment on Scotia's particular take on on cloud.

19:05.400 --> 19:09.480
Yeah. Well, we're definitely focused on it. I think all the big banks are focused on cloud.

19:10.440 --> 19:16.440
It's perceived with caution. There's no question about that. You know, the big challenge that I think

19:16.440 --> 19:21.080
all corporations are having right now, not just banks, is protecting our customers data. So,

19:21.080 --> 19:27.640
obviously, that's always going to be primary in our mind. So, the way we're, you know, approaching

19:27.640 --> 19:35.320
the cloud is cloud in general is an untrusted zone by nature, the native cloud. And so, we have to

19:36.120 --> 19:42.200
build the capabilities and the security mechanisms that will allow us to gradually move in that

19:42.200 --> 19:48.440
direction. It's a very big question for banks and large corporations. And, you know, above all,

19:48.440 --> 19:53.560
banks are going to move very cautiously in that direction. So, some of the capabilities of

19:53.560 --> 20:00.600
the cloud we are exploiting, but only in very specific ways to always put first our customers

20:00.600 --> 20:07.080
protection. Sure, sure. And if you looked at some of the data science, machine learning AI,

20:07.080 --> 20:13.560
offerings that the cloud vendors are coming online with in particular. We have. And for sure,

20:14.280 --> 20:17.800
you know, some of these capabilities, again, we're seeing them here at Pegaworld.

20:18.440 --> 20:25.560
You know, machine learning is a big area. It's a big push. I would say, you know, we're

20:26.280 --> 20:30.440
working with it. We're experimenting with it. And again, having pockets of success with it,

20:30.440 --> 20:35.240
but in general, for us right now, we're starting at the bottom of the pyramid and making sure

20:35.240 --> 20:39.960
we have, you know, our data layer just right and then understand how to draw the insights and

20:39.960 --> 20:44.680
intents out of that. Machine learning comes a little bit later down the road when you know you've

20:44.680 --> 20:49.400
got your decision models working the way you want them. And then you just, you know, again,

20:49.400 --> 20:54.600
you've got to have that transparency of as I'm learning, I need to be able to track where this

20:54.600 --> 20:59.240
thing is going because you've always got compliance and audit issues to be able to say why was

20:59.240 --> 21:04.600
any particular decision made. So, machine learning is another area where we're going to proceed

21:04.600 --> 21:11.160
with great caution. And we're going to, you know, understand it very well before we start making

21:11.160 --> 21:17.720
the making choices about how to use it. Maybe going back to the underlying data discussion.

21:17.720 --> 21:24.200
One of the things that you mentioned that was interesting was you, you've got this historical

21:24.200 --> 21:30.040
data, you've got the social data again. And then you've got this notion of the customer journey.

21:30.040 --> 21:37.960
And I'm wondering, does that notion of the customer journey, does it exist some place as a thing?

21:37.960 --> 21:43.960
And like what is its native form and where does it live? Is it, you know, is it Justin Pegas? Is it,

21:43.960 --> 21:49.800
you know, something that you store in some database or is it, you know, created on the fly every time

21:49.800 --> 21:56.360
from all these different pieces and parts? That's a great question. I think it's a virtual concept

21:56.360 --> 22:01.160
for sure. We don't have a customer journey database and we don't have a customer journey tool.

22:02.200 --> 22:08.360
It's really something that we work on with the business. So the business obviously is the one

22:08.360 --> 22:14.040
who draws the customer journeys and understands them and we support them in that analysis.

22:15.160 --> 22:21.400
But what I would say is it's kind of built into our decision capabilities. It's built into our

22:21.400 --> 22:27.080
processes and it's, it's embodied in all of our systems. As, you know, every time we're building

22:27.080 --> 22:32.760
new systems, those systems represent points on the customer journey. And so that data that comes

22:32.760 --> 22:38.040
out of those systems goes back into our data layer and eventually you will have something that is

22:38.040 --> 22:44.440
sort of a record of customer journeys, if you will. But the actual work that's done on behalf

22:44.440 --> 22:48.520
of the customer, the decisions that are made on behalf of the customer, those are embedded in our

22:48.520 --> 22:53.640
systems. So the concept is virtual, but there are very real artifacts of it all over the bank.

22:54.520 --> 23:02.120
What are some of the, what are some of the areas that are kind of most exciting for you as you both

23:02.120 --> 23:07.480
here at the conference, you kind of see what is happening with, you know, one of your key vendors

23:07.480 --> 23:13.960
in this space as well as just in the broader industry, you know, as machine learning AI and other

23:13.960 --> 23:23.160
things are evolving. Well, so I'm particularly interested in this concept of customer centricity.

23:23.160 --> 23:28.200
And it's a big theme in many of the vendors and many of the companies that are working with

23:28.200 --> 23:33.640
customer data. And for me, it's, it's going to be a real challenge to kind of step out of the

23:33.640 --> 23:41.400
comfort zone of being a product oriented or, you know, historically companies sell products and

23:41.400 --> 23:47.560
services. And of course, we'll always sell products and services. However, customer centricity

23:47.560 --> 23:55.800
challenges us to start looking at differently at the way we bring our products and services to

23:55.800 --> 24:03.000
the customers. So, you know, as I always say, banks are not, are not missions, but we are customer

24:03.000 --> 24:08.520
focused organizations. And increasingly, your focus on the customers, what's going to be the

24:08.520 --> 24:13.000
deciding factor in whether customers stay with you or not? Customers are becoming much more

24:13.000 --> 24:17.480
demanding over time as well as they should. There's more technology and more capabilities at their

24:17.480 --> 24:24.920
disposal. So, this idea that, you know, if you, if you look across an organization, you look across

24:24.920 --> 24:30.840
all of their systems, you've got decisions being made on behalf of your customer all over the place.

24:30.840 --> 24:36.120
And some of them are manual, you know, we're doing things in contact centers and branches and,

24:36.120 --> 24:41.720
you know, we got financial advisors. And some of them are just embedded in codified in our

24:41.720 --> 24:50.920
systems. And so, the idea that we want to start to have some kind of a holistic capability to

24:50.920 --> 24:56.200
think about our customer and to bring things to our customers, that's going to be a huge challenge

24:56.200 --> 25:02.440
for, for large corporations. And, you know, we're out there now increasingly competing with

25:02.440 --> 25:08.040
non-banks. And non-banks have all sorts of, you know, new technologies at their disposal. So,

25:08.040 --> 25:13.400
we've got to be able to compete with them on the same terms. So, being more customer-centric

25:13.400 --> 25:20.280
will definitely play a role in that competitive challenge. A quick question on that, that point.

25:21.080 --> 25:27.960
You mentioned that a big part of customer-centricity is having a holistic view of the customer.

25:27.960 --> 25:34.680
Does that necessarily mean centralized or must it in fact remain decentralized and we just have to

25:34.680 --> 25:41.640
deal with that? I think just the nature of our systems is that you'll never have a perfect customer

25:41.640 --> 25:47.320
data record. That's not going to exist. But the idea. And even the specific thing that you were

25:47.320 --> 25:55.400
talking about that triggered this question was around the different points that customer-related

25:55.400 --> 26:01.400
decisions were being made. Like, is it, you know, as part of the vision of, you know, what you're

26:01.400 --> 26:09.400
doing around decision automation to like have a single place where customer decisions are made?

26:09.400 --> 26:14.200
Or I don't, again, I don't know forever, have a single place where customer decisions are made,

26:14.200 --> 26:21.240
but to the extent that we can coordinate better the touch points with the customer,

26:21.240 --> 26:27.080
I think that's going to be a really important advance in technology. So it's an interest for me.

26:28.440 --> 26:32.680
I think that if you just put yourself in the customer's shoes for a minute and if you're

26:32.680 --> 26:39.320
receiving multiple offers from the companies that you do business with and they may be

26:40.360 --> 26:44.360
similar enough for your wondering why are you sending me two offers for credit cards? I don't

26:44.360 --> 26:51.160
need two credit cards. Maybe I need one, right? Or, you know, you're offering me a credit card on this hand

26:51.160 --> 26:55.240
and I'm talking to you about a mortgage on that hand. How are these two things going to affect

26:55.240 --> 27:02.120
each other? So I think to the extent that we can centralize at least the direct customer touch points

27:02.760 --> 27:08.920
and, you know, coordinate those and have an arbiter of, you know, customer focus. I think that

27:08.920 --> 27:14.680
will be a big advance that's going to come in the next few years so that we really look like when

27:14.680 --> 27:18.760
you're dealing with a bank, even if you're dealing with different people, you're dealing with one

27:18.760 --> 27:26.120
bank. That's kind of the point. Okay, and you were getting to AI. Yeah, so I think for AI,

27:26.920 --> 27:31.000
and, you know, I was sitting on a board with a few guys talking about this a little bit earlier,

27:31.880 --> 27:37.800
we're mastering historical data now and we're making real-time decisions, as I said, instead of

27:37.800 --> 27:44.040
segmented decisions and things like that. So I think we're getting to the point where we can make

27:44.040 --> 27:49.160
the best decision, make the best interaction or have the best moment with the customer now. Okay,

27:49.160 --> 27:53.640
we're getting better at the historical aspect of that and the real-time aspect. So we've overcome

27:53.640 --> 28:02.040
that first challenge. But I think a next challenge is going to be having better models for understanding

28:02.040 --> 28:08.280
how the decisions we're making with our customer right now will impact them and us in the future.

28:08.760 --> 28:15.800
So again, the example I was giving today in discussion was if I'm offering a credit card,

28:15.800 --> 28:22.200
how's that going to impact the propensity to get a mortgage later? Or, you know, if I know that

28:22.200 --> 28:27.000
that customer may be in the market for a new car loan in another year, is that credit card going

28:27.000 --> 28:32.520
to impact that new car loan? What's the right offer for them and for the bank to maximize that

28:32.520 --> 28:38.680
overall equation? So I think, you know, there will be a point in time where we start looking forward

28:38.680 --> 28:42.840
and saying, how do we model out? You know, what's the next step in the customer journey? Not just

28:42.840 --> 28:47.640
the previous step and the current step. I think that's going to be a really interesting set of

28:47.640 --> 28:52.840
questions that are brought up and discussed over the next couple of years. I've had a number of

28:52.840 --> 28:59.080
conversations with folks and it always strikes me that, you know, just where we are in the process,

28:59.880 --> 29:05.640
we're optimizing around, you know, very much low-hanging fruit like, you know, these kind of

29:05.640 --> 29:13.480
incremental decisions or very simple metrics that don't necessarily tie to kind of the long-term,

29:13.480 --> 29:18.840
big picture, total lifetime value of a customer relationship, for example. That's way out of

29:18.840 --> 29:23.560
scope for what most people are thinking about today. That's true. If you think about the financial

29:23.560 --> 29:29.400
markets, part of my history was doing modeling of financial instruments and I used to, you know,

29:29.400 --> 29:34.280
model balance sheets for banks and things like that. You know, you're always looking forward

29:34.280 --> 29:40.040
and you're looking at things like volatility curves and forward curves on underlying assets

29:40.040 --> 29:44.440
and things like that. And then you're modeling and you're saying, well, you know, things can happen.

29:44.440 --> 29:49.160
I'll model out into the future and I'll take the expected value of that or I'll, you know,

29:50.200 --> 29:54.200
adjust it for probabilities, et cetera. And I bring it back and I say, what's the best decision

29:54.200 --> 29:59.960
to make looking out into the future? Well, you know, we are financial actors in our customers'

29:59.960 --> 30:04.360
lives. So at some point, you want to be able to take that same look forward and say, you know,

30:04.360 --> 30:09.480
this decision or this offer or whatever it is, is going to have an impact on them and is going to

30:09.480 --> 30:15.160
have expected value to us. So why don't we find a way to start looking forward a little bit and see

30:15.160 --> 30:20.120
if, you know, it's the right decision now and the right decision for the future. And I think that's

30:20.120 --> 30:24.360
going to be a whole big area of analysis and learning over the next several years.

30:24.920 --> 30:31.880
So we talk quite a bit about the way the data tier needs to enable this and some of the things

30:31.880 --> 30:37.560
you're doing. You're looking into the future. How do you see that data tier evolving to

30:37.560 --> 30:43.320
meet all of these needs? Good question. I don't know. I think, as I said, I think this is going to

30:43.320 --> 30:49.240
be something that evolves over time and the questions will be asked and answered by people who are

30:49.240 --> 30:55.960
smarter than I am. But I do think that there will start getting into a little bit of, you know,

30:57.400 --> 31:01.960
profiling of, you know, people and how they work and how they live and how they, you know,

31:01.960 --> 31:06.440
use financial instruments and saying, you know, the average customer who takes financial instrument

31:06.440 --> 31:11.080
like this when they're at this point in their life uses it in these ways. So you'll model around

31:11.080 --> 31:15.960
that and probably have some kind of statistical modeling around it and then bring it back and say

31:15.960 --> 31:21.720
it's our belief that this is the tool that will take you forward in this way. And again, I don't

31:21.720 --> 31:27.560
know, but I do know that financial modeling is normally to go forward with an expected curve and then

31:27.560 --> 31:34.680
apply, you know, kind of statistical methods around that expected curve and say, you know,

31:34.680 --> 31:39.160
randomly things happen. How do we bring it back and understand the impact on today?

31:40.040 --> 31:45.000
Awesome. Awesome. Well, Jim, thanks so much for taking the time to sit down with me.

31:46.200 --> 31:54.360
Any final thoughts or any words of wisdom for enterprises and financial services or

31:54.360 --> 31:57.400
in other industries that are just starting out down this journey?

31:57.400 --> 32:02.520
I think if I was, and again, I've been in the field for a long time, I've been 30 years,

32:02.520 --> 32:09.400
you know, in the IT world, I think what I would say is the game changer now is that the customer

32:09.400 --> 32:15.160
is really in charge. The customer is sophisticated. They know that we've got all kinds of capabilities

32:15.160 --> 32:20.440
and all kinds of data. They're expecting us to use it to mutual benefit of ours and theirs.

32:21.000 --> 32:25.480
And so, you know, anything you're doing, if you're doing it on behalf of your customer,

32:25.480 --> 32:29.560
it's, you know, it's the right path. You got to keep the customer in the center.

32:29.560 --> 32:32.440
Awesome. Awesome. Well, thanks so much, Jim. Pleasure to meet you.

32:36.360 --> 32:42.760
