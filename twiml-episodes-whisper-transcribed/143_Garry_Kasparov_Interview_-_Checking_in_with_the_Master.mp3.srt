00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:32,440
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,840
This week we are super excited to celebrate the second anniversary of our favorite machine

5
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,280
learning and AI podcast.

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,640
With your help, we've hit a bunch of exciting milestones over the past year, including

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,480
surpassing 2 million plays, growing the meetup to nearly 800 members, and bringing you

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,480
over 115 interviews.

9
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,680
What an amazing ride.

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,880
To celebrate the anniversary, we'd like to hear from you about the ways the podcast

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,600
has helped you or your business, how it's enabled you to find or connect to resources

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,440
you've found valuable, or how it's educated you about new and interesting topics.

13
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:16,800
Submit your written or audio comments via the anniversary page we've set up at twimble.ai

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,640
slash 2av.

15
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,360
With your permission, we'll be including a few of your stories in a special podcast episode

16
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,840
coming soon, celebrating the twimble community.

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,640
In this episode, I'm joined by legendary chess champion, author, and fellow at the Oxford

18
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,320
Martin School, Gary Kasparov.

19
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,280
Gary and I sat down after his keynote at the Figure 8 Train AI Conference in San Francisco

20
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,920
last week.

21
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,400
Gary and I discussed his bouts with the chess playing computer deep blue, which became

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,360
the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in their 1997 rematch, and

23
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,600
how that experience has helped shape his thinking on artificially intelligent systems.

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,440
We explore his perspective on the evolution of AI, the ways in which chess and deep blue

25
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:14,160
differ from go and alpha go, and the significance of deep minds latest creation alpha go zero.

26
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,120
We also talk through his views on the relationship between humans and machines and how he expects

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,440
it to change over time.

28
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,760
Before we jump in, I'd like to send a shout out to our friends over at Figure 8 for their

29
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:32,200
continued support of the show and their sponsorship of this week's series, which all took place

30
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,520
at train AI.

31
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:40,320
Figure 8 is the essential human and loop AI platform for data science and machine learning teams.

34
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,680
Just a reminder, this episode was recorded live on site, so there's some unavoidable

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,160
background noise.

36
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,760
And now on to the show.

37
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,520
All right, everyone, I am here with Gary Kasparov.

38
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:16,520
Gary is chairman of the Human Rights Foundation, author of Winters Coming and Deep Thinking, a

39
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,520
visiting fellow at Oxford Martin School, and of course, the 13th world chess champion.

40
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,040
Gary, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

41
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,880
Thanks for having me here.

42
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,880
Absolutely.

43
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,720
So, tomorrow, May 11th is a significant day for you.

44
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,480
For those that are not familiar with your story, maybe we can start out by having you tell

45
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,160
us a little bit about the significance of that day and kind of your path leading up to

46
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
it.

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,760
I think it was a significant day for computer science more than chess.

48
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:58,200
And now, 21 years later, so I can think about it, I can discuss it without the same anxiety

49
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,480
and even anger that I had at the time when I faced the blue for the second match.

50
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,280
I'll remind people, it was the second match because I won the first one in 1996.

51
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,600
And I lost this match.

52
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:17,280
And I heard even today at the conference here in San Francisco about many people talking

53
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:25,720
about moment of inspiration, not only within IBM, rank and files, but beyond that.

54
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,640
People saw the great accomplishments for machine eventually prevailing in the game of

55
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
chess.

56
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:39,800
It's in the game that always was viewed as the sort of pinnacle of human intelligence.

57
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:48,240
And at my presentation at train conference, I gave a little bit of a background of this

58
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:58,720
quest for holy grail in chess, beating chess wall champion was an ultimate goal for the

59
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
founding fathers of computer science.

60
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,280
They believed that would be the moment of revelation, the dawn of artificial intelligence.

61
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,000
And I have to say that somehow they were wrong.

62
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How's that?

63
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,160
Because they expect it and we can hardly blame them for making this mistake.

64
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,960
Because these great, great men, the great minds, Alan Turing, Claude Shannon, Norbert

65
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,240
Wiener, they couldn't imagine the amount of brute force that was, that is, at our disposal

66
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:36,040
now, or even was it in 1997, they believed that for machines to make any significant progress

67
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:42,440
in conquering the human domain of cognition, machines will have to be intelligent.

68
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,040
It's more like emulating human thinking.

69
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:51,280
And the brute force that IBM could build into the blue to throw into the game of chess

70
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,320
in 1997 proved to be enough to play at the top level.

71
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:03,080
I think objectively speaking, when you look at the games we played in 1997, the blue was

72
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
not unbeatable.

73
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,840
It was probably even weaker objectively than I was at that time.

74
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,720
But this is a mistake many people made and still making.

75
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,760
And I think that for machine to dominate any game, it has to be perfect, no, it has to

76
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,760
be better.

77
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
Right.

78
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,560
Simply better, which means making less mistakes than humans.

79
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,200
And humans are pushed making mistakes.

80
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:30,360
Even the best humans, the world champions, the top players, we are vulnerable to all sorts

81
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,840
of factors, psychological pressure.

82
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,640
And the moment we make mistakes, we expose ourselves because machines, let's say they

83
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,960
have steady hand.

84
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,120
They're getting faster and faster and with this enormous amount of brute force and speed,

85
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:51,040
they already created a challenge that was very hard for humans to deal with.

86
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,840
And this is a pattern that we could observe in any activity.

87
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,120
First we think it's impossible.

88
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,000
Then machines are playing with us, competing with us, but they're laughingly weak.

89
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,040
Then it's a very narrow window of competition.

90
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,560
In chess it was from 1995 to roughly 2005.

91
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,600
And then machines are superior forever after.

92
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,560
You made the point earlier that people put a lot of significance on that date in 1997,

93
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,640
but to you, the turning point was earlier.

94
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:28,400
Yeah, it was earlier because it's, yeah, if we, if we want to be objective and scientific,

95
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:35,000
we should look at game one of our match with the blue in Philadelphia a year early in 1996,

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,520
I won the match, as I mentioned, but I lost game one.

97
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,640
And the fact is that machine could win one game on the normal tournament conditions against

98
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:48,680
current world champion, men that the rest won the better of time.

99
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,840
It could take a year, two, three, but, but it was already the writing on the wall with

100
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,800
capital letters, the boarding letters, which you thought it would take longer than it did.

101
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,880
I thought it would take longer, you know, I think I could have played better.

102
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:09,040
And after match with the blue, I played two other matches with other programs, chess engines,

103
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:15,280
deep freights and deep junior, one German program, one Israeli program, both matched in 2003,

104
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,960
both ended in a tie.

105
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,360
Again, objectively, these programs were as good as the blue, maybe even stronger, though

106
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,080
they didn't have the same computing power behind them.

107
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,440
But as I said, it was just, you know, protracted agony.

108
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:37,280
In 2005, it became apparent that human machine competition was over.

109
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,400
My successor, Vladimir Kramnik, who was a world champion, played two matches with deep

110
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
freights.

111
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
He tied one.

112
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,680
He lost the second one down the few other matches by prominent players.

113
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,760
And it was already one sided.

114
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:56,480
And it proved my point that I made immediately after 1997 match that we had to look already

115
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:04,880
beyond this competition for an opportunity to find a new algorithm of humans and machines

116
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,640
working together.

117
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:14,760
Because in chess, we could actually make these experiments, bringing humans' creativity,

118
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,640
humans' fantasy, humans' imagination, and to match it with machines' brute force

119
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,160
of calculation and memory.

120
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:27,440
So what does that actually mean in the context of chess, the two humans and machines tend

121
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,720
to operate at vastly different speeds?

122
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:35,880
No, no, but it's still, it's about your ability to get the best out of this combination.

123
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,560
Because you're going to have two players of roughly even strengths operating with the

124
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,000
same kind of hardware, even the same software, and you will end up with very different

125
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
results.

126
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,080
Because the trick is, and that's something that I think makes chess quite unique, testing

127
00:09:52,080 --> 00:10:00,080
ground for all these scientific discoveries, that each machine requires, call it special

128
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
treatment.

129
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,240
Because no machine goes out of a sudden perfection.

130
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,120
And the human's role is to compensate for machines' deficiencies.

131
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:14,040
So to actually find exactly what is machine weakness and how we can use our human qualities

132
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:23,640
to cover it, to make sure that these weaknesses will not cause significant damage during the

133
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,800
game.

134
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:32,840
And the trick is that to succeed in playing in this team, human plus machine, you don't

135
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,840
need the strongest human and all the fastest machine.

136
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,680
You have to make sure that the interface is the most effective.

137
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:47,080
So that's why relatively weak human, with average computer, but superior interface, will

138
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,640
be dominant in the game of chess against stronger human player, faster machine, with inferior

139
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
interface.

140
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,920
Well, I'd like to come back to this point of the human machine interface in chess and

141
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,080
understanding the machine's weaknesses.

142
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:07,920
But before we do that, just to contextualize, deep blue, you'd like to refer to it as a

143
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,040
10 million dollar calculator or alarm clock or something.

144
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
That was relative to where we are.

145
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,280
It's the, I mean, deep blue would have never passed during tests.

146
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,280
Right.

147
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,800
But that's again, that's so what?

148
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:26,000
So this is, we don't realize how much help we receive from what Claude Shannon described

149
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
as type A machines.

150
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,360
It's brute force executing human instructions and tremendous speed.

151
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:42,360
So deep blue just proved that with massive processing power behind the program, you could

152
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,120
perform better than humans in the field of cognition.

153
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,200
Again, I want to emphasize it.

154
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,880
I think it's very important for people to realize it's not about solving the game.

155
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,200
It's about winning the game.

156
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
It's not about playing perfect game.

157
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,920
It's about playing better.

158
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,040
The same goes for driver's cars now.

159
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,040
People think, oh, yes, it's not safe.

160
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,600
Nobody tells you to be safe.

161
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,600
It will be safer.

162
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,720
Again, it's all about percentage.

163
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,600
So machines will never, will never be formed at the 100% precision.

164
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,920
But they will do step by step.

165
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,160
They will do things better, more effective than humans.

166
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,680
And that's all we have to look for.

167
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,480
It's just about improvements.

168
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,760
It's about incremental improvements that we're combined are just securing our progress.

169
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,920
So can you elaborate on the distinction between those two at any game of chess when the

170
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,040
human makes a move?

171
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,120
If the machine is doing a brute force analysis of all the possible, are they doing all

172
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
the possible?

173
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
No, it's impossible.

174
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,440
All the possible moves because according to what Claude Shannon, the number of legal

175
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,000
moves in the game of chess is 10 to the 45th power.

176
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Sure.

177
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's number.

178
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
It's insane number.

179
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It just doesn't exist.

180
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,520
It exists on paper.

181
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,360
No way machine can make calculate all the moves.

182
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:09,560
So at certain point, you need human intervention or to be more precise, humans guidance to help

183
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,400
to tweak a little bit the way machine is heading for.

184
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,960
And was that, how was that present in the match with deep blue?

185
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,760
No, the blue was me versus machine.

186
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,320
It was human versus machine.

187
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,520
So now when I leaking my wounds, I just realized that that was time to think about

188
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:30,320
the way for us to work together.

189
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,400
Though I still was ready to compete and I wanted to play the rematch with deep blue.

190
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:39,720
And as I said, deep blue, they're not being intelligent, denied me the rematch because

191
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:45,880
I think IBM recognized that the match, the match in 1998, I think I had a very good

192
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:51,640
chance of winning because I could be better prepared and there's nothing IBM could gain

193
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
out of this match.

194
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,240
It was bad for science, they decided not to play the third match, the rubber match because

195
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,640
I won the first one, they won the second, but it was good from the business perspectives.

196
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,440
And the IBM executives, they looked at the stock value.

197
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:11,000
So again, I can't complain, so as people said, okay, you made two mistakes, Gary, it's

198
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
not about chess.

199
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:20,520
A, you have not secured the next match, B, you have not secured stock options.

200
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,360
So how would you have prepared for that match differently?

201
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,200
I would have taken the blue more seriously because I didn't expect the progress they made

202
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
after the first match.

203
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,880
And also I would probably demand more transparency with the way the blue operated.

204
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,800
So just to understand more, because we needed some information about the blue.

205
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:44,040
I mean, for instance, one of the biggest mistakes I made preparing for the second match is

206
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,440
not reading the contract, actually not reading the fine print because to prepare you need

207
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:55,040
games of your opponent, you have to know how your opponent thinks.

208
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,880
If it's computed, it could even more important because machines are flexible than humans.

209
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,560
So by having some games, access to some games, you can understand how machine could make

210
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,000
decisions in some types of positions.

211
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,200
After the first match, I said I would need the blue games and they said absolutely.

212
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,760
And the contract said stipulated games will be provided and the fine print said only

213
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,600
played an official tournament.

214
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,280
And of course, the blue played only left.

215
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,560
So one of the things I would have demanded and they knew it, it's to have access to all

216
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:33,440
the blue games, to understand how they make certain improvements.

217
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,600
Then I would definitely insist on certain limitations of making changes for the programs during

218
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
the match.

219
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:46,240
I remember that it would have not secured my victory, but it definitely would put more

220
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,720
pressure on them because also I would start thinking about my preparation opening.

221
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,440
So when you lose, it's kind of a lot of time thinking about it.

222
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,040
You know that you have to make certain improvements.

223
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,800
And I was already contemplating what new things I could bring in.

224
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,120
And again, as I said, objectively, I was still stronger at that time.

225
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,880
And all I needed is just to spend maybe a couple of months confiding on this match, just

226
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,240
getting stronger physically, mentally.

227
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,680
So it would be a big challenge for IBM, they just walked away.

228
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,200
So deep blue wasn't even AI.

229
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,000
No, absolutely not.

230
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,080
That's what's annoying is that it was a great accomplishment, but it was type A machine,

231
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,920
a brute force.

232
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,160
You can even say that deep blue demonstrated the limitations of brute force.

233
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:47,960
So as the, it's, it's what you can do, I mean, it's the, your improvement is still,

234
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,080
would be based on human contribution.

235
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:57,000
So it's all about, you know, human help that is needed to program the machines.

236
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,960
We still have very strong powerful machines now with this, that you can download just

237
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,880
engines on your, on your software.

238
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,440
But it's, you know, you don't need these massive power processing power.

239
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,560
So they're much stronger than the blue, much, much stronger.

240
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,760
And it's just a, they operate on your laptop.

241
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,760
Yeah.

242
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:19,920
So it's, but still, you know, it's, it's, it's a moment that, you know, it was undeniable

243
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,400
moment of inspiration.

244
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,840
And though I was on, on the losing side, so I was a victim, but, you know, why I could

245
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:37,080
feel not proud, but more comfortable these days, thinking that, you know, somehow by sacrificing

246
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,080
myself.

247
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,800
So I, I helped you in progress.

248
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:44,760
Tell us a little bit about how computer chess has evolved since then.

249
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:51,440
Oh, as I said, we have very strong chess engines these days, that are far superior to any

250
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,880
humans, for those who are familiar with, with chess, Commodore, Stockfish, Houdini, so just

251
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,720
those, those programs that are so much stronger than the current world champion, Magnus Carlson,

252
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,160
that the gap between them is about the same as between Magnus Carlson and the decent player

253
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,240
from open international tournaments.

254
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,840
And these are also, these are all still type A types of, you know, type A machines, they

255
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,400
are just, you know, they're being equipped with more knowledge.

256
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,720
So it's, it's the, it's the software, so it's sophisticated day.

257
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,440
The blue could be up to two, up to 200 million positions per second.

258
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:35,760
These machines would be, I would say, make six, seven, eight million positions per second,

259
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:41,080
but it's more than enough because they, they search mechanisms far more sophisticated.

260
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,200
So they just, you know, and they do it better, but it's, but it's still, it's the, it's,

261
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,160
it's, you call it data crunching, yeah, yeah.

262
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
Yeah.

263
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:55,520
Now people said that it's the, with machines being so strong, chess would face extinction.

264
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,360
To the contrary, chess is more popular today because it's interesting paradox.

265
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,880
On one side, you have machines that could be any humans, but on the other side, it took

266
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,160
away the curtain of mystery from the game of chess because when I played an hydraulic

267
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,760
carpal for the World Championship matches, even the grandmaster, grandmasters that were

268
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,400
analyzing games in the press center and making commentaries on television, they were very

269
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,160
shy of criticizing our game.

270
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:27,120
Even if we made mistakes, yes, but it's world champion and the challenger.

271
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,320
How can you say something negative?

272
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,960
You're not sure.

273
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,120
Today, every amateur equipped with a computer could see that Magnus calls him at a blender

274
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,880
because machine is screaming.

275
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:44,160
So now, on one side is annoying because I mean, following these games on the internet and

276
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,440
seeing how this bunch of amateurs are just laughing at Magnus Carlson makes me feel angry.

277
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,720
But on the other side, don't read the comments.

278
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,240
But on the other side, he brings poor people in because they can understand it.

279
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,240
Makes it more accessible.

280
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,480
Plus they can, you know, they can look at the games, they can analyze the games, they

281
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
can make preparation.

282
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,440
So I think machines played a positive role overall when you look at this overall contribution

283
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:12,560
by making chess more attractive to millions and millions and millions of fans that before

284
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:19,600
fell inferior to the top players, they couldn't be part of this process.

285
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,960
So they were passive watchers.

286
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,040
Now they feel they are part of this whole process.

287
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:31,080
And we thought that in chess, you know, we would see this gradual development with this

288
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,120
type A machines.

289
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:40,480
And the conventional wisdom was that stronger machines are dollar the game is because machines

290
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,880
will see the combinations when advance and there will be less tactics and it's more

291
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:50,040
position maneuvering and it's games will be not as exciting.

292
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,880
Typically the games played between strongest type A engines.

293
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:59,560
They are, I would say, 70, 75, 80 moves long while the human game is about 80 moves.

294
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,480
So you can see it's more precise but less exciting.

295
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,840
Now everything has changed with the appearance of alpha zero.

296
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,640
That's the, that's a very new type of machine.

297
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:18,760
By the way, I call it here type C and ironically, as we can say that type B machines contrary

298
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,120
to the expectations of founding fathers never succeeded in chess.

299
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,440
Actually they just, you know, we didn't want to have type B machines.

300
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,320
So it's this because the idea of emulating human thinking but still operating with human

301
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,440
knowledge didn't work out.

302
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,000
We don't even really know what it means.

303
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Exactly.

304
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,080
But it's the, I think it's again, it's important psychological contradiction in our mind.

305
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,360
So we want machines to create a miracle but also want to understand how is the miracle

306
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,360
we can create.

307
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:52,280
I always say that the aeroplanes flying faster than any bird without flapping their wings.

308
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:59,320
Deep blue, one, you know, one of the match against world champion out before me without

309
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:02,680
thinking me because it's just the machines do it in a different way.

310
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:06,040
Now with deep blue, you could spend if you're patient.

311
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:12,120
You could spend a year or so looking at all the logs, you know, going deep, deep down

312
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,240
to find out exactly why certain decisions was made.

313
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:22,040
With alpha zero, I don't think even Demis Hassab is the founder of the program from

314
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,640
Google's Deep Mind.

315
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,520
I don't think even he can tell you why version five played better words than version

316
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,520
six.

317
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:34,920
But the importance of alpha zero that is actually demonstrated that is chess program or

318
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:43,400
go program or any program designed on the alpha zero platform will do better without any

319
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,840
human data.

320
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:53,680
All it needs is rules like a framework to work with to work with and it does the rest.

321
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:59,120
I think it's it was quite sensational because while I thought that in golf, for instance,

322
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,960
the human knowledge was quite poor because go is so complicated, it is a complex strategic

323
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
game.

324
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:12,120
And you could say that the the best go players today, they would be at the level of chess

325
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,040
play a couple of hundred years ago, because no offense meant it's just the way they play

326
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:21,360
because there's so many options, they just they have to go through this very slowly

327
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,400
recognizing the patterns.

328
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:30,080
And if you show chess games to a great player of the past of early 19th century, he will

329
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,680
be shocked to see some of the moves today.

330
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:40,640
But what's happened with alpha zero chess that by playing 60 million games against itself,

331
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,640
right.

332
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:47,000
Before ours, of course, with all massive Google power behind it, it created its own scale

333
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,640
of evaluation, which is quite sensational because we didn't see before machines that were

334
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,120
able to generate their own knowledge.

335
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,560
And the way alpha zero played was also contrary to our expectations.

336
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:10,120
It played very aggressive dynamic chess, sacrificing material and looking for patterns that

337
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:17,160
even for me was, even for me, it was quite revealing because I mean, I could sense that,

338
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,440
but just to see machine that could have the same kind of sense, that was stunning.

339
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:28,640
So if you had some opportunity to analyze its approach to this game, so what I found

340
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:37,280
out is that is alpha zero again, out of statistics, accumulated and derived out of the 60 million

341
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:45,280
games, figured out certain patterns and connections between material, time and quality, those things

342
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,640
are totally incompatible for computer.

343
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,560
But just again, statistically, you know, it actually reached a point where it could see

344
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,560
the connection.

345
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:58,760
So that's why sacrificing material, playing with a pawn down or even a piece down, was

346
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:06,920
not a big challenge for alpha zero because somehow, from the 60 million games database,

347
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,800
it had a good compensation.

348
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:16,800
When alpha zero played one of the strongest type A machines, chess engines, stock fish,

349
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,240
we could see that it was always one or two moves ahead in getting correct evaluation.

350
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,040
Now, why it's interesting because stock fish in this match that we didn't have the

351
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:33,400
most powerful hardware that it could show, that it could give stock fish sort of the best

352
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:38,480
opportunity to realize its potential, still it was powerful enough and it made roughly

353
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:46,240
six million positions per second, alpha zero made about 60,000, so it's much more precise

354
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,280
in what it shows to evaluate exactly, so I'm quite happy to say that chess still offers

355
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,600
unique opportunity for us to continue these experiments.

356
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:03,120
So it's about the way machine generates some data, how flexible machine is to change

357
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,840
the data under the pressure of sort of of a new formation that is being introduced.

358
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,040
And so what will be the human's role in working with these machines because people could

359
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,640
get really panicked.

360
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,280
And I'm to the contrary, I'm very optimistic because I could see an opportunity for us

361
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:27,000
to share our knowledge and just to be what I call the shepherds of guiding these AI flocks.

362
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:35,480
Did you find when evaluating these alpha zero games that it exhibited an entirely new style

363
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:42,920
of play or did you recognize a human element in it or a reaction to the human element?

364
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
It's a little bit of a style.

365
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,720
Actually, it played more like Yarrick as part of the Anatolian Carpool.

366
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,720
Again, contrary to the conventional wisdom that believes stronger machines will play more

367
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,480
defensive chess.

368
00:26:52,480 --> 00:27:00,480
But what was new there is that it could actually move on sacrificing material without seeing

369
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,520
immediate consequences because you could look at other engines that have that very powerful

370
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,880
calculation function.

371
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,840
And neither stock fish nor other problems didn't see the immediate danger coming out of

372
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,400
the sacrifice.

373
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:22,840
So which means that alpha zero based its sacrifice, not on immediate benefits, but on the projects

374
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,080
of benefits.

375
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,680
Chess has been very well analyzed, tons of books written about openings and things like

376
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
that.

377
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:36,680
I'm curious if in looking at the alpha zero play, did you find a new opening or a new transition

378
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,400
or was there anything like that?

379
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:46,320
What's not about new opening is that the one I could learn from the games I saw and

380
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,920
two hours I spent with alpha zero in the lab is that it has created its own skill of

381
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,440
evaluation, which is probably slightly different from the traditional approach.

382
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,560
Is it more sophisticated, probably, maybe not, but what is very important at the machine

383
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,880
came up with its own data.

384
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:14,840
It has created knowledge that proved that what we believed was almost fit that complete

385
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,360
actually had many flaws.

386
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,600
And I think it tells us that no human knowledge considered dogma.

387
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:30,320
I think I will help us to fight out traditional ideas that the human experience that had been

388
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,880
accumulated over centuries, it cannot be touched.

389
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:43,600
This is the foundation that we have to build our constructions of our theories.

390
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,600
Anything can be challenged.

391
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:52,640
It doesn't mean that everything will be refuted, but alpha zero opens a new era of us actually

392
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,800
revisiting many things that just consider to be sacrosanth.

393
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:03,440
Circling back to this topic of humans and machines, you've talked about in your book, you've

394
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:10,320
recognized the historical role of this narrative, the human versus machine narrative, and you

395
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,400
refute that.

396
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,960
It's one that is easy to sell.

397
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:22,760
Humans versus machine, we against them are humanity versus aliens.

398
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:29,000
And that's one of the reasons why I'm so skeptical, actually critical about AI being

399
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:36,200
presented as artificial intelligence, because artificial sounds alien, sounds frightening.

400
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,360
It's like a challenge to us.

401
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:45,160
It's something that will potentially threaten our existence because it's a different form

402
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,280
of cognition.

403
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:53,840
I believe that augmented is more precise because it reflects the idea of cooperation and

404
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,840
it sounds friendly.

405
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,200
And it's very important for us at this point is actually to walk away from these dystopian

406
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,200
views.

407
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,360
It's determinators, the metrics.

408
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:09,160
I always remind people that capacity for evil is still exclusively human.

409
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:15,360
And the greatest danger in the future, the foreseeable future, is not a sky net.

410
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,320
But bad guys, dictators and terrorists that could have hands on the new technology and

411
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:25,560
they will use it to undermine the very foundation of the free world, where these technologies

412
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,200
have been created.

413
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:36,440
And so in the context of chess, you've been working on some projects to exhibit the power,

414
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:40,800
if you will, of humans and machines working together, how, or where are those efforts

415
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,520
now and how, how do you assess them?

416
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:48,560
I think the future of the human plus machine cooperation in chess will be probably in the

417
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:55,160
field of humans plus type A machines facing type C machines.

418
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:02,320
So just to recognize, so to test the flexibility of these new machines.

419
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,240
And also, we could have the continuation of what is called now freestyle chess, humans

420
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,240
plus machines.

421
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:15,520
It could be one human plus, few computers or several humans with several computers.

422
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:21,720
It's a different form of human machine cooperation with an idea to provide the best quality.

423
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:28,720
And I think there's still many, many interesting experiments to be carried, because as I said,

424
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:35,080
every problem requires unique combination of humans plus machines.

425
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:45,200
And what we learn from chess and what I think will be also the case in, let's say, in

426
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:54,480
medicine, in medical diagnosis, you don't need top expert to work with the best machines.

427
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,520
Moreover, sometimes having the best expert in the industry could become the productive,

428
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:04,480
because machines already superior in many instances.

429
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,280
And you just have to recognize that you are there to form a partnership, but to be a partner

430
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,720
that belongs to few, last few decimal places.

431
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:21,160
There's nothing wrong about it, because we can start looking at our exclusively human

432
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,960
qualities.

433
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:30,240
I think that AI, well, intelligent machines will make us smarter, considering the form

434
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,880
of promotion, because we can start thinking about questions.

435
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,960
We can start thinking about concepts.

436
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
We can strategize.

437
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,280
There's still so many things that we do and machines cannot do it yet, or just definitely

438
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,600
will not do it in foreseeable future.

439
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:55,640
And I want people to stop fretting, stop talking about a GI that will dominate the world

440
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,280
and will make us relevant.

441
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:03,080
And let's look at the current problems and let's see how we can turn this most powerful

442
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:07,080
tools that have been created to make our lives better.

443
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,760
That's what we always did with new breakthrough technologies in the past.

444
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,280
Well, Gary, thank you so much for taking the time to chat with me.

445
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,280
Thanks for inviting me.

446
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,280
Awesome.

447
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,440
And it's definitely to be continued, to be continued, because Alpha Zero is the beginning

448
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,440
of a new era.

449
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,880
And I'm sure that every six months we'll keep bringing us more news.

450
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,800
And again, I want people to remember the future of self-fulfilling prophecy.

451
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,520
And it's for us to be optimistic and just to look for opportunities, not ignoring the

452
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,440
problems, but not to concentrate too much on the negative side.

453
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,440
Right.

454
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,440
Thank you.

455
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:51,680
