All right, everyone.

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,480
I am here with Julien Carruga.

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,800
Julien is computer vision team lead at Genius Sports.

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,800
Julien, welcome to the Twimal AI Podcast.

15
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Hi Sam.

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:27,440
Hey, it's great to have you on the show and I'm looking forward to digging into your paper,

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:33,720
which you'll be presenting at CVPR in the computer vision in sports workshop.

18
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,800
But before we do, I would love to have you share a little bit about your background and

19
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,280
how you came to work in computer vision.

20
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,280
Yeah, sure.

21
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,280
Right now I'm the computer vision team lead at Genius Sports.

22
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,800
I'm responsible for leading applied research in video understanding and videography.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,200
I work together with a team of scientists and engineers trying to get the best technologies

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,960
for the company.

25
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:07,840
Before joining Genius Sports, I was an associate professor in a university in Bogota doing

26
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,600
research in signal processing and in-match processing and computer vision.

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:20,520
But I was contacted by the company and they offered me a joint for a very exciting kind

28
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,280
of products with basketball.

29
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,200
And since I played basketball since I was like 10 years old, so I was so excited and

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,560
I accepted the offer.

31
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,120
And yeah, I did PhD in informatics and mathematics in France, yeah.

32
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:44,440
But before that, I was working more in signal processing and all the theoretical aspects.

33
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:49,920
But then I started to work with images and video and that's when I'm doing right now.

34
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,240
All right, cool.

35
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:58,800
And tell us a little bit about Genius Sports and some of the things that you do with computer

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
vision at the company.

37
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Yeah, sure.

38
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:10,760
So, Genius Sports is a living company in sports data and sports media and all the regulator

39
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:16,120
sports bearing sectors and it's specialized in the capturing distribution of real time

40
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,120
day.

41
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:24,320
In particular, in my case, yeah, we are doing more of applied research trying to do like

42
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:31,240
video understanding and videography to get automatic production and to collect data in

43
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
real time.

44
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:39,320
This data will enrich the kind of data that we provide to our partners and some of the

45
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,160
product that they're working right now, they are related with automatic production with

46
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,320
single and multiple views, yeah.

47
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:53,560
And also the collection of data in the age really close to the event to the sport event

48
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:00,360
for instance, basketball and volleyball and a really short period of time.

49
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:08,080
How much of what the company does is focused on or related to vision data versus other types

50
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,080
of data sources?

51
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
Yeah.

52
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,480
So, actually, we start like two years ago, I think when I joined the company, so we are

53
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
really new.

54
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
Okay.

55
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
We're all there.

56
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
Yeah.

57
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
Yeah.

58
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Yeah.

59
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,800
I guess you mentioned some of the broad things that you're doing there, but you're, I guess

60
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,680
in terms of your, you mentioned that your focus is like applied research.

61
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,280
What are some of the projects that you're focused on?

62
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,280
Yeah.

63
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,640
So, the first one is out of my production.

64
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,280
It can sound like, what is that, but it depends.

65
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,600
And also the complexity it depends.

66
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,960
So, for the case of the paper that we are going to, it's a single camera disabled to observe

67
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,760
the full, the full card or fill, so the idea is just to generate a virtual camera, but

68
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,000
there are other scenarios when you have more than one camera in order to produce a higher

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,880
quality production every switching and doing some transition between cameras.

70
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,280
So in this, in the simple scenario, when you only have one camera, it is just to get the

71
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,360
proper frame and to track the main actions, yeah, and in real time, of course.

72
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,440
But when you have more than one camera, you have to bring it to the spectator like a better

73
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,440
experience of the event and trying to select the proper point of view for each action.

74
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,720
So the problem is more shutting it.

75
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:43,200
And so the paper that you're presenting at CVPR is that single camera only, or does it

76
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,800
include multiple camera scenarios?

77
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Yeah.

78
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,400
And this paper is for basketball and is with a single view, and the main goal is to produce

79
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,000
a high-query production that is really fast.

80
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,120
Because for sports events, the latency of this broadcast is quite important.

81
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,880
So if you want to do any processing of this video, you don't want to add a large latency.

82
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:20,760
So actually, in our work, we are able to just add like 300 or 400 milliseconds for this

83
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,160
is really important.

84
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,200
But however, there are other components in the streaming processor that are adding more

85
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
time.

86
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:34,880
So the idea of this technology is to be able to produce this high-query production without

87
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:42,480
adding a large latency to the full pipeline in order to get this broadcast to the spectators.

88
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,480
Okay.

89
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:49,880
And if folks are listening and would like to take a look at the demonstration of the

90
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,720
project, we've got that, we'll have that in the show notes.

91
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,240
It's up on YouTube.

92
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
And it's pretty cool.

93
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,440
You start out with this kind of wide-frame view of a basketball core and you show by adding

94
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,280
additional layers of information that you can localize the ball and localize the players

95
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,760
and know which part of the core the action is going to be on and kind of pan the camera

96
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:18,240
back and forth and zoom in and zoom out.

97
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,080
So at the end result, as you've described and as the paper's title, kind of an automated

98
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,800
production where presumably you can just kind of point this camera that's connected to

99
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,760
a model at a basketball core and it'll produce something that's kind of watchable and engaging

100
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,320
and interesting as opposed to just the ones zoomed out view.

101
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:47,360
When we're talking about sports production today, like I would imagine you've got a pretty

102
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,360
broad range of what's actually done, like you've got, you know, maybe at high schools

103
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,360
or maybe even some colleges, you know, a single video that's without an operator that's

104
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,600
just recording and then, you know, certainly in the professional sports, you probably

105
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,400
have teams of people creating a production.

106
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:13,160
Can you, is the goal here to produce something that is kind of productized and replaces

107
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,200
one or more of those scenarios?

108
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:24,480
Yeah, so one of the ideas with this project is to enable some people and college and schools

109
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,120
that they are not able to have a like a professional cameraman or something like that, yeah, to

110
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:36,400
be able to record their games, yeah, but not only to record the games, but also to record

111
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,800
and to stream them to wherever a point, yeah, through the internet.

112
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:48,840
Yeah, so, you know, parents and family friends, our fans can watch the game of their favorite

113
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:57,080
team, yeah, without an expensive system of capturing production and streaming, yeah, this

114
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:04,640
is one, one, one part, the other part is that we are able to do the auto production, yeah,

115
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,720
with the scene, uh, as you mentioned, with the wide view, we have the full information

116
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,280
and at the same time later, we are also working on that.

117
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:21,800
We can capture at the same time data, more data locations and analytics and also embed

118
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:28,520
that in the same broadcast, yeah, and also with low data.

119
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:35,440
And so is the the setup that you've got a single high resolution camera and the panning

120
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,440
and zooming is all done digitally or are you actually controlling the camera?

121
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,440
Exactly.

122
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:49,520
Actually, it's a fixed camera, it depends on the, on the fill, yeah, and the distance,

123
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,160
it should be a wide angle with a wide angle or a standard camera, now if you have like

124
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:00,120
a large venue, you can use whatever camera, but if not, you will need like a wide angle

125
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,920
or with a wide angle, yeah, and then all the production is over a virtual camera.

126
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,760
So it's just like a digital crop or digital zoom, yeah, trying to get that.

127
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:18,200
So there's an important trade of here is that you want to contain the main action inside

128
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,200
this virtual camera, but this really is, I mean, if you are not doing any production,

129
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,120
you are containing the main action, yeah, but you have to crop, yeah, but you have to

130
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,240
crop enough in order to get the attention of the superior to the main action.

131
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,560
So there is a trade up that you don't want to lose any action, yeah, but you want to

132
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,320
contain the action, so it should be like large and small enough to contain properly that

133
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,960
and it depends of the kind of basketball, yeah, I mean, imagine NBA NCAA is something

134
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:51,360
like that, or college basketball or kids or something that the speed of the game that's

135
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,760
going to be different, so you can incorporate that in order to have like a smooth enough

136
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,120
production, but you don't want to lose any action.

137
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,120
And what resolution cameras have you worked with out of care?

138
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
Yeah.

139
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:15,280
So our standard setup is a 4K camera, yeah, and the resolution of the producer game,

140
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
it depends.

141
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:21,240
If you are doing streaming, perhaps not so high, but it could be like full HD or HD,

142
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:27,200
you are just recording, yeah, it can be full HD, yeah, it depends of also on the internet

143
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,400
connectivity, or if you only want to record, if you only want to record, it can be like

144
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
full HD.

145
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:40,520
Okay, cool, so I mentioned in the demo, you roll through at the beginning a set of layers

146
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:46,400
showing, localizing the players and the ball and things like that, you actually show quite

147
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:53,960
a bit of information overlaid onto the screen in the demo, what are the main contributions

148
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,440
of the paper?

149
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:02,360
Yeah, so right now we're developing, I think that we are pushing a lot, trying to get

150
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:10,720
like M2N systems, yeah, instead of that we wanted to have like a more modular system,

151
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:17,760
yeah, going to the basics of the team sports, I am trying to get like a button up system,

152
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,360
so in basketball you have your ingredients, you have your players, your hoveries, and

153
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,680
you have the ball, and that's it.

154
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,680
So we wanted to custom something based on that, I'm trying to get good solution for localizing

155
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:37,320
the ball and players and perhaps in time, yeah, and then trying to build really nice roads

156
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,960
of production that can behave well depending on the different kind of basketball, yeah,

157
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:48,920
and there is a good thing is that in the company we are a lot of people that love basketball

158
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:54,840
too, actually we use it all these knowledge and all these experience trying to get good

159
00:12:54,840 --> 00:13:01,640
rules of production that perhaps in this M2N approach is quite hard, because you're

160
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,640
going to have a reference, yeah, and you want to have this crap in order to fool this

161
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,400
and that, but depending on the basketball is not so intuitive and not so easy to include

162
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:18,280
these kind of rules, but in our approach, there is a modular, yeah, you have your ingredients

163
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:25,800
or your model or the locations of your actors in this case, ball and players, and we take

164
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:33,640
out the ref and then depending on that, we can at every time select the proper crop or

165
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,880
the action.

166
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:43,400
So where they make contribution, first of all, is like a full pipeline, yeah, that the

167
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:49,800
more data you are getting of basketball games, the detector that you have for ball and player,

168
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,360
they work, they will work better.

169
00:13:52,360 --> 00:14:00,600
So you're going to be always in the right position, and also it can easily be implemented

170
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,640
on any field, yeah, and it's not a spend time is working in a real time.

171
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:11,360
Okay, so I think you packed a lot into that explanation, but one question that jumped out

172
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,480
of me was you mentioned that you start with these ingredients and identifying where the

173
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:24,800
players are in the ball, and then you mentioned having rules to determine what the optimal

174
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,520
crop and zoom are, do you mean those rules literally meaning that the deep learning is

175
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:39,320
doing the detection and localizing the ingredients, and then you've got a set of static rules

176
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:47,040
that are based on that information that do the production or is the production also part

177
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,840
of a learned model.

178
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:55,800
Yeah, so the learned model is there are two main components that they are learned.

179
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,880
One is the actors, ball and players, and the other one is what is the game state, because

180
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,320
depending on the state of the game, you want to follow one rule or you want to do something,

181
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:11,640
you want to be more attentive, or you want to be almost still, it depends, yeah, but

182
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:17,400
we are not trying to learn the proper virtual camera, yeah.

183
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:23,880
That was a choice that we did, yeah, I remember that when discussing the different approaches

184
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:30,440
that we could take, there are really similar configuration of players, yeah, and depending

185
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:36,160
on the ball, you want to frame that I am actually in one way or in another.

186
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,240
So you have to first, you have to be aware of where is the ball, yeah, but not only the

187
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:47,280
ball is directing where is the proper framing, and you'll have to be aware of the players

188
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,120
and pleasure distribution, yeah, but not only this distribution will tell you what is the

189
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,720
proper frame, and you need a combination of these two depending on the game state.

190
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,440
And sometimes, I mean, in end-to-end approaches, yeah, if you want to state that like an end-to-end,

191
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,120
you have all your ingredients or even your raw video, and then you want like an output

192
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:13,240
the proper framing, yeah, and it's going to be like a black box, and trying to adjust

193
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,880
that for one kind of basketball or one kind of thing that's going to be quite hard.

194
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:26,160
This is what we did this choice, and yeah, so it's really, it's quite easy to set one

195
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,640
kind of behavior for what kind of basketball.

196
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,960
Okay, okay.

197
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:36,960
When you say one kind of basketball, what are examples of the kinds of basketballs that

198
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:39,560
would change the way you were referring to that?

199
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:46,000
Yeah, so there are some challenges when you want to produce basketball with a really

200
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:52,880
nice zoom, yeah, and just for instance, if you see the production that they are doing

201
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,920
for NCAA or for NBA, it's quite different, yeah, NCAA, usually they are just having

202
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,280
like a almost still camera in the hardcore for hardcore possession, and then just they

203
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,680
are just moving for the transition, and that's it.

204
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:15,040
For the NBA, they really want to track and to do more zoom when they are doing a hardcore.

205
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:21,360
So this is like a two kind of production, but by kind of basketball, I'm talking about

206
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,400
the maximum speed, so the main challenge when you are trying to do that is someone that

207
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,520
is really fast, like LeBron James or something like that, yeah, and you want to track the

208
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,920
main action, but you don't want to disturb the people that are watching the production,

209
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,080
so you have a trade-off, yeah, so if you already know that your basketball is not going

210
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:45,400
to be so fast, yeah, you can have like a maximum speed of the virtual camera and things like

211
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:51,080
that, and be sure that you're going to be able to track the main action, but if your basketball

212
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,440
is quite fast and you don't want to lose the main action, so you have to relax somehow

213
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:03,680
your roles in order to always be in the right position, okay, okay, so the modular approach,

214
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:09,600
it sounds like it allows you to, it gives you a little bit more kind of knobs for addressing

215
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,880
these different characteristics of games in terms of faster and slower, and also it sounds

216
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,800
a little bit like it, it will allow maybe in more of a professional setting if this is

217
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,560
deployed, whoever is using it to kind of tune in a personality for the way they want

218
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:34,080
the video to kind of feel in their NCAA versus NBA for example, yeah, yeah, and even for

219
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,800
the case of NCAA, between men and women is totally different, usually for women, the

220
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:45,880
point guard is really close to the half-court with the ball, so if you want to take a look

221
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:50,320
at the point guard and also the action that is taking place under the basket, you need

222
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,440
a wider framing, but for men it's totally different, they are moving different, so they are

223
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,560
something that, I mean, we are not trained to learn that, but it's also possible to learn

224
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:06,480
that and to avoid feeling that by hand or by the satisfaction of customer that is usually

225
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,880
what we are doing, yeah, sometimes customers prefer this kind of production that other,

226
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,760
but it's quite easy to transfer that, you know, we're models, yeah, that is not so easy

227
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,240
for an end-to-end system that you have to change your last function or your data or whatever

228
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,480
it is, yeah.

229
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:35,200
And retrained, you also overlay this graph of Gaussian-based actionness in the video,

230
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:43,040
and it seems to try to capture where the action is or is likely to be on the court.

231
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:48,960
Can you talk a little bit more about that metric and what goes into it?

232
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:49,960
Yeah, sure.

233
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,280
So the first thing that we are modeling players, like two-dimensional Gaussian in the court,

234
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,440
that is quite intuitive, yeah.

235
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:04,680
So since we have like a core model, it's quite easy to have like shapes with the

236
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:11,680
proper sizing pixels in the image, yeah, and also to map that to a 2D history, so we are

237
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,200
able to model the distribution of players.

238
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,680
And our hypothesis is that if players are more concentrated in a given area of the court,

239
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:26,000
it's more likely to have like more action there or something interesting that will happen,

240
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
yeah.

241
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,400
Imagine that half of players are in one half-court or the other half is in the other half-court,

242
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,320
so sure if they are in the amount or something like that, yeah, it's quite hard to decide

243
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:43,080
where I should look, or perhaps I should do a sum out, yeah, yeah, something like that.

244
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,080
So this is one thing.

245
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,480
The other thing that you can easily think is, okay, if you have the ball, you only need

246
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,920
the ball, right?

247
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,880
And you can track the ball like in soccer or something similar or in volleyball, I don't

248
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:00,200
know, yeah, and yeah, but there are a lot of interesting things that you also want to

249
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:05,960
see, you'll not only want to see someone with the ball like that, and everyone in the

250
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,640
key area taking screens and doing a lot of things and trying to get free for a shot, so

251
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
it's quite interesting.

252
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,800
So this function is trying to describe this likelihood, yeah.

253
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,600
But along, it's not so useful because we know that we want to have this ball.

254
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,280
So what we are doing, we are taking each player and modeling this player as a 2D Gaussian,

255
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:33,480
and then we get this action as function that is a mixture of a Gaussian, yeah.

256
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,920
And depending of the complexity of the production that you want to do, you can take this distribution

257
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,640
and take the optimal framing.

258
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:48,280
I mean, you can also compute the amount of sum to cover a lot of players or not.

259
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:55,000
But in the paper and the video that we showed, this simplification, we are just projecting

260
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,920
these to the mixture of Gaussian to 1D, yeah, and we have like a 1D function, and we

261
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:07,920
just want to take the peak of this function as the center of the action, and then we just

262
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,840
center the virtual camera at this value.

263
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,440
And then with the ball, we take a lot if the ball is inside or not.

264
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:22,680
However, embassable with a single view is very likely that the ball is going to be

265
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:28,160
not visible or hard to detect because someone is taking the ball or hiding the ball or doing

266
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,960
something, and you don't want the system to be lost in this situation.

267
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,440
So this action function is more stable, yeah, and the peak is not moving so fast because

268
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,680
it's not possible that one player that is here is going to be here in the next frame,

269
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
yeah.

270
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:47,480
So it's going to be this kind of smoothness, and we want to track this peak to get this

271
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,840
like a good center for the virtual camera.

272
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:59,440
Okay, cool. So the actor localization that I'm imagining is a supervised learning problem

273
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,920
you've got video, you've got, you know, someone's labeled your players with bounding boxes

274
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,680
and you just train a model to recognize the players, is that correct?

275
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:15,240
Absolutely, yeah, it's a classical, a classical, a deep learning approach, yeah.

276
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,160
We have some examples of ball, some examples of reveries, and some examples of pleasures.

277
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:25,560
And the class of reveries is not too easy for an NCAA, the reveries are always dressing

278
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:28,640
the same, but it depends on the basketball, yeah.

279
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:38,000
We want to take the players out, yeah, or at least to be aware of, sorry, we, yeah.

280
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,560
And yeah, but it's totally supervised.

281
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:47,200
And the precision and recall the, the texture, it depends, in our case, we use a JOLO

282
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,160
version 3, yeah, now it's available JOLO version 4, and today's, I go like your JOLO

283
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,160
version 5.

284
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,400
But there's some controversy over whether it's real yellow or something.

285
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Yeah, yeah.

286
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:05,440
And, yeah, so the nice thing of this approach is that better, when a bird detector and a

287
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:11,520
faster is available, we can just plug here, yeah, and be more confident on the detection

288
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,800
of our actors, yeah.

289
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:20,320
And also we are using our core model in order to, do not train over the raw image, but we

290
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,560
transform the image according to the core model.

291
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:32,640
So we ensure that the network is on the observer, observing the area of the cart, yeah.

292
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,880
And there's some, um, proportion when we are doing this transformation that made the job

293
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,880
easier for the detector.

294
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,000
So this is why even on the large overlap, we are able to detect players with a really

295
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,960
good accuracy.

296
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,680
So elaborate on that a little bit more, it sounds like you're saying you, you have JOLO

297
00:24:53,680 --> 00:25:01,440
as the detector, and that's operating on still frames, correct?

298
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,120
And you're, you've also got this model for the core that, you know, the angle of your

299
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,760
camera, and I'm assuming we're talking about like the 3D model of the core and like, uh,

300
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:16,400
the 2D 3D projections, and that kind of thing, is that what you're referring to?

301
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:25,160
Yeah, so, yeah, so since the camera is fixed, uh, we localize the, the cart, or I mean,

302
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:29,720
we localize the camera, you can see one side or the other, but it's, it's killing.

303
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,480
So we can compute actually a core volume.

304
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,160
So like the projection of a, uh, a, of a volume of interest, it might be like a four meter

305
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,960
high, five meter high volume in the image.

306
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,600
So we can take this region, yeah, and actually to crop and transport that and feed the network

307
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:52,280
when we are training, yeah, and this will ensure that the variance of the, uh, sizes for

308
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,680
the object that's going to be not so high and can be more specialized in order to detect

309
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,240
the players, because it's not expecting whatever size of players and things like that.

310
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Yeah.

311
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,880
So how tightly cropped around a player is the image that you're feeding to the detector?

312
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,440
Is it, is it very tightly cropped or is it, you know, half-court or, or something like

313
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,440
that?

314
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,480
No, no, it's, is the, is the full court, yeah, but imagine that we are taking out everything

315
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:26,280
that is not the court and just taking like a crop that exactly contains, uh, all the pixels

316
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:32,400
of this volume and the players there, uh, they're going to look, uh, similarly in shape,

317
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,760
I mean, it's not likely to have like, uh, better in this transformation that, that's going

318
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,240
to be the double or, you know, three times the size of other.

319
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:48,840
So the number of, of, of anchors for Jolo, it's going to be, um, um, as well as number,

320
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,840
yeah.

321
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,840
Okay.

322
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:57,960
I mentioned earlier that part of your, uh, your, the contribution of this paper is, um,

323
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:05,240
being able to, at least what I took as being able to do this kind of actor detection and

324
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:12,240
localization in a, in a short time frame, can you elaborate a little bit more on if you've,

325
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,840
you've got the out of the box detector, what pieces are you doing on top of that?

326
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:23,320
Yeah, so then when, when we have all these, uh, detection of actors, they depended a lot

327
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:29,560
on Jolo, uh, version three, yeah, and it's going to be faster when a new detector or, or

328
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:35,320
faster, the, uh, so actually we did like sound changes in Jolo, uh, usually Jolo is not

329
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,440
so good for small objects, but in basketball, there is one small object that is really important

330
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:49,160
that is the, that is the ball, yeah, so actually, um, um, that is like, um, a map that is, uh,

331
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:55,480
component in different, uh, layers, we modify one layer in order to take, uh, the later 11,

332
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:02,680
that is able to get, uh, some interesting feature of small objects, uh, till 14, times 14, uh,

333
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:10,200
size, yeah, and this enables us to detect the ball in a more consistent, uh, way.

334
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,200
So starting with these detections, then we, we use our core model, again, to localize the

335
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:23,880
players in this, in the core plane, and to create this action as function, yeah, but then, or also,

336
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:31,000
we get that to the histograms that is trying to estimate, uh, where is the state of the game?

337
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Yeah, if it is a half-core, uh, timeout, or a transition or something, in order to switch

338
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:46,680
for the proper role, yeah, or the production. And yeah, is that, is that based solely on player

339
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:53,160
position, the, yeah, game state? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, so for this paper, yeah, but, uh, of course,

340
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:59,240
you want to also add the tempo information, yeah, because you can, you can have like a

341
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:05,000
distribution of players for different situations, yeah, but the story, it's, uh, yeah, I mean,

342
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,880
that would have worked. I would imagine like right after a basket, if you're the balls being

343
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:13,800
inbounded, you're going to want to, to be zoomed out, because you know the ball is going to end

344
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,440
up on the other side of the core quickly, or something like that. Like, there's incorporating in

345
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,880
knowledge about not just where the, the, the players are, and where the ball is, but like, what's

346
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,640
actually happening from a semantic perspective could be interesting, an interesting signal.

347
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,840
Yeah, so actually right now, we are trying to, uh, move forward with these, uh, we're including

348
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:42,600
more things. Okay. We really want to have like a live, but I create enough method for production,

349
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,480
without trying to get all these components, uh, and trying to have like something, because we really

350
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:54,120
want to be really fast, yeah, and trying to build on that. But then depending of the challenge,

351
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:00,120
and there are some challenges that the system is failing, sometimes you don't want to lose, uh,

352
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,920
small part of it transition, or you are trying to follow someone that is going with the ball,

353
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:12,680
and you arrive a bit late, yeah. And yeah, sometimes it's, it's, it's happening, yeah, but they're

354
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:19,640
really, uh, small cases. Yeah. So it's like because it's combining all these ingredients, yeah,

355
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:25,080
the action, the game estate, and then there is a controller that is really simple, and depending

356
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:31,400
of the state is deciding something, yeah, I'm producing a really high quality. And however,

357
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:37,160
there's something that I really like to have, like trying to have more sum and a variety of sums,

358
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:45,480
premiums, uh, bit, uh, during the health court possession, trying to be more like tracking the

359
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:53,720
action, yeah, but it needs more, um, awareness. The system really needs to understand more states

360
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:59,640
inside, uh, the health court state, for instance, like a screen in the key area,

361
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:06,120
or so what is preparing for taking a three-pointer, or something like that, yeah. So our idea is to

362
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:11,720
increase the number of states, yeah, because this number of states will increase the number of

363
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:19,240
rules of production that we can have. Okay. And are the, the rules for your controller,

364
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:28,440
are those handcrafted, or are those learned as well? Yeah. And so we have this core volume, yeah.

365
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,160
Yep. And so imagine that we do want to have like a sum out, this is where this is you already

366
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:39,880
know your core volume, and you can find like, uh, the optimal framing that contain this core

367
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,760
volume, the full core volume, and it's well centered. Yeah. But then we also have another

368
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:51,560
framing. For instance, the left, uh, the left health court framing, yeah. And the right health

369
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:56,520
health court framing, but also you can have a lot of set of frameings, or you can have a continuous.

370
00:31:56,520 --> 00:32:03,320
Yeah. In our case, we have a discrete, uh, set of frameings inside each health court,

371
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:09,560
and depending of the peak of the actionist, we are just moving to the proper framing inside the

372
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:15,640
health court. Yeah. This, this is like a easy solution for the problem, but you can also have

373
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:22,920
like a continuous, but I will be honest with this, this grid set of, uh, frameings, the quads,

374
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:31,080
is really good. Yeah. But the solution will be better with a continuous, uh, set of frames,

375
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,480
things like that. Yeah. And to be clear, when you, you, you, you have a discrete set of

376
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:43,400
frameings, but the, um, the virtual camera is not jumping from one discrete place to another.

377
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:51,000
It's a smooth transition from one to the next. So, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so, yeah. I'm

378
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:57,640
for doing that is actually quite this is just a proportional, uh, control when, uh, moving from

379
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:04,680
this framing to the, these started framing and trying to obey a maximum speed of the virtual

380
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:13,000
camera, because we don't want to talk, uh, use data. Uh, and so still with the, you've got this discrete

381
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,240
set of, uh, views. Did you just write down the rules, you know, the correspondence between the,

382
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:27,800
the game state and the, the framing or did you try to learn it anyway? No, no. Yeah. So, for the

383
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:34,120
transition is just, uh, free camera. Yeah. So it's a virtual tradition from one to another. I get

384
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:40,360
that's just following PID or performance. Yeah. No, no, sorry. So, so imagine that, I think that the two

385
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:46,440
main, uh, states of the game are transition when we are moving to one hardcore to the other,

386
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:53,560
and the hardcore position. So we expect that they're going to remain there for a 15 to a 24 second

387
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:59,960
something of that. Yeah. For doing a transition, the camera is like a free camera. Yeah. Trying to be

388
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,560
smooth, but trying to contain, uh, the main action or the peak of the action is and the ball at the

389
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:11,080
same time. And there is a trade of there. But the, the ball, if it's, uh, visible, it should be

390
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:16,760
continued. Yeah. And it's trying to do like a free camera. But in the hardcore, yeah, we know that

391
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:23,480
we want to be in this hardcore. So we are moving to this set of discrete, uh, views or framing,

392
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:29,560
yeah. And we are choosing, uh, the framing that is more, or that is closer to the peak of the

393
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:36,520
action is. And if we were in a different framing, we are just doing a pro, a pro proportional motion

394
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:44,280
to the next framing. Yeah. And, uh, in the, in the demo, that's a 2D projection. But the peak of

395
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:52,600
the action is in 3D on your core model, right? Because you also zooming in and out. Yeah. So

396
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:59,880
actually the peak of the action is, uh, is in 2D. So because the domain of this function is,

397
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,520
is the core plane. So for instance, I don't know, inside the key in the middle of the key in the,

398
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:11,160
something like that. Yeah. Uh, for a single camera, yeah. And if you don't want to do a lot of

399
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:16,760
zoom during a hardcore possession and things like that, you can just project to 1D and to select

400
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:24,840
or like a, like a panning motion of your virtual camera. Yeah. But if you really want to, uh, do like

401
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:31,000
a full professional with zoom in and, and, and zoom out and everything, you can exploit this

402
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:37,080
action in 2D and to be aware of the action is, is in the other corner of the hardcore and trying to

403
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:42,040
be more close to the action and to exploit better the pixel that you want to, uh, to broadcast.

404
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:49,000
Cool. And so you, you've suggested a few of the next steps here. Can you maybe talk a little

405
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,720
bit more about, you know, where you go based on this or, or have you, are there even other papers

406
00:35:53,720 --> 00:36:01,720
that you've already published beyond, uh, yeah. I, I, I cannot say a lot. Yeah. But, uh, one of our,

407
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:08,280
I mean, the fourth right now is trying to improve some things. The lighting of the bayonets

408
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:15,240
sometimes is making things difficult. Yeah. Uh, yeah. So imagine that, uh, that the ball is not

409
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:21,000
detected for some reason. You have a lot of windows and you have a lot of, uh, change in illumination

410
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:27,320
and shells and things like that. And the ball is, is, is the ball detector is failing. Yeah. So

411
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,880
you're going to be, I mean, all your production is going to be based in the action expansion. Yeah.

412
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,000
And you don't have all your ingredients and we can fill. So we are trying to get more robust

413
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:43,160
detector and to get more data, yeah, because the whole detector is totally, uh, data driven. So

414
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:49,800
we need the more data that we can have in order to teach them the network to detect any

415
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:55,000
little combustible. Yeah. And if we have the ball, the metal is quite good. The other thing that we

416
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:01,960
want to do is to optimize some things. Uh, of course, we're going to run JOLO, you need a GPU,

417
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:10,120
yeah. And this kind of GPU or server that you are using will determine, uh, your inference time.

418
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:17,640
Yeah. So if you want to be fast enough, you need a good server, but perhaps, uh, you want to do that

419
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:22,920
locally in the edge. Yeah. And it's not too easy to afford this kind of server for a public

420
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:29,160
school or for a college or something like that. Yeah. So if we can get a better detector that can run

421
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:35,880
really fast in CPU or a very cheap GPU or something like that, we are trying to move that and to get

422
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:43,800
like lighter detector that they are doing a good job. And yeah, but if you have a good server

423
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,360
or a good internet and you can use a string to the cloud and we process in the cloud,

424
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:54,520
we are getting up. So right now we are trying to get like a multi-mysed version and trying to run.

425
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:01,720
We are a detector and to try and to correct some errors and some things that they are not so

426
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:08,440
likely, but even it's happening one time and again or two times. People that are not so happy,

427
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:14,120
yeah. So it is to be almost perfect. But at the same time, we want to include more cameras,

428
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:19,800
yeah, and trying to switch also like not expensive cameras, yeah, but trying to switch among these

429
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:25,160
cameras. And on the other hand, since we are already aware of the location of players,

430
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:31,160
at the same time without a production, we are collecting or we can collect some statistics that

431
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:37,160
they are going to be really useful, yeah, for players, for the coach, for fans, for everyone,

432
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:43,160
yeah, in real time or after the game, it depends because the necessities are different.

433
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:50,120
And have you already tried using this method with other sports? You've mentioned soccer a

434
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:57,480
couple of times. How easily generalized is it to, you know, similar but different sports?

435
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:06,200
Yeah, our abilities should work. I mean, the main, the first modules, I mean, the actors and

436
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:11,880
something like the core model or field model for soccer and things like that, but the rules of

437
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,840
production, if you're watching soccer or volleyball, they're going to be different. This is the

438
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:23,640
really nice part, yeah, because you don't have to change all your model, yeah, you have your knowledge

439
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:29,480
here or the knowledge of the location of the actors, but then you can incorporate other kind of

440
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:36,840
knowledge in a later stage, like how you should produce soccer or one camera or two or for

441
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,680
20 cameras or volleyball or any other sport, but the main ingredients, yeah, they're going to be

442
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:49,240
the same. Yeah, but yeah, we, we are trained at the other sports, yeah. So you're already starting to

443
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:57,480
look at that. Yeah, yeah, sure. Any other thoughts on future directions for this or, you know,

444
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:02,360
other things that you're excited about it, kind of this intersection of computer vision and sports?

445
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:08,200
Yeah, yeah, actually, I think that the idea of system, it's going to be, it will be like a system

446
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,040
able to do this over market production, but at the same time providing these statistics and

447
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:21,000
analytics for any kind of user. So for the players and coaches in real time saying, okay,

448
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:27,720
these are some statistics and events and analytics, like, yeah, but really, you know, with low

449
