00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
Hey what's up everyone this is Sam. Today is a very special day for me and the

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,720
entire Twilmal team. After over 1200 days of podcasting interviews with guests

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,920
from six of the seven continents and Antarctica we see you. Nearly six

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,640
million downloads and less than two weeks away from our very first conference we

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:30,680
are ecstatic to bring you the 300th episode of the show.

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,920
coinciding with this important milestone I am excited to share that we'll be

7
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,200
rolling out updates to the Twilmal brand over the next few weeks. When I

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,480
launched this week in machine learning and AI I never imagined that I'd be

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,120
meeting new people who'd see my name or hear my voice and say hey you're the

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,600
Twilmal guy. Not to say the Twilmal is a household name or anything like that but

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,840
we love this and are embracing it. With that in mind the show will now be known

12
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,760
as the Twilmal AI podcast. If you head over to Twilmal AI.com you can check out

13
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,720
our new logo and the refresh show graphics that accompany this change.

14
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:13,200
Obviously we want to know what you think of our new look so please reach out via

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,440
email, Twitter, the show notes page, carrier pigeon or whatever works best for

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:23,240
you. And now on to the 300th show.

17
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,880
All right everyone I am on the line with Kalai Ramia. Kalai is a data scientist

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,480
at Park, the storied Xerox research organization. Kalai welcome to this

19
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:39,960
week in machine learning and AI. Thank you Sam. Thanks for having me. It's great

20
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,400
to be here. It is great to have you on the show. You come at data science with a

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,080
background in transportation and that certainly influences some of the

22
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,320
research that we'll be talking about today. But I'd love to hear a little bit

23
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,400
more about your story and how you came to be interested in the intersection of

24
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:03,640
these fields. Sure. So my undergrad and grad background like Master's

25
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:09,160
background was in transportation systems. So I was working on a lot of you

26
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,720
know spatial design of transportation networks and all those things. I was

27
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,480
getting bored a little bit of doing the same things again. So I went to grad

28
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:23,640
school in a super interdisciplinary program which involves transportation, energy

29
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,960
systems, econometrics, environment. So I don't even know how to describe it in

30
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,720
one sentence what I did. But I had like four advices just to give a

31
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,200
taste of how that was. I'm starting to you know I believe that the

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,200
harder it is to describe what you do the more interesting it is.

33
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,560
Yeah. So I'll try anyway. So I worked on something called integrated assessment

34
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:57,640
models. So these are the models they use it to inform for example the IPCC

35
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,640
reports for climate change. It is an intergovernmental panel for climate

36
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,000
change. So if they want to inform the public like what's going to happen in a

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,720
two degrees Celsius policy, then these are all the things that be

38
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:14,360
saying this report using this mathematical model. And this is a humongous

39
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:20,600
model where we solve each sector in a Rubik's cube format looking at what are

40
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,240
the cost effective pathways for transportation to achieve the climate goals

41
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,080
or for residential even like what would be the right amount of LED lights we need to

42
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:35,000
have to achieve this efficiency criteria and so on. So that was my

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,040
PhD program. So I like I mentioned like I worked with all kinds of fields to

44
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,560
build this humongous model. And I my specialty or my

45
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,880
dissertation was focusing on like including human behavior in

46
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,960
light duty papers like how people will be able to purchase different kinds of

47
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,520
new technologies and how that will lead to

48
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:03,080
climate goals. So that was the essence of it. And while I was doing that in my

49
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,920
grad school, I was getting familiar with machine learning

50
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,480
and advanced data science techniques. And I spent a little bit of that in my

51
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:19,000
postdoc on a special data. Then I joined Park. So that's when like I started my

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,080
you know interest in deep learning systems and other things on a variety of

53
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,360
projects. That sounds like a lot of fun. And the

54
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:33,000
work that we're going to be digging into today is focused on an analysis of

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,320
the infrastructure to support alternative fuel vehicles. Can you talk more about

56
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:44,360
your research in that area and how that specific line of inquiry came to be?

57
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,960
Yeah so in that particular paper you're talking about I did the analysis on

58
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:56,120
hydrogen fueling stations. So are you aware of fuel cell vehicles?

59
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:03,640
At the super high level. Yeah but I'd love to hear your kind of take on where we are

60
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:09,080
with those. Okay so I drive one. That is all you need to know right now.

61
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:14,280
So they exist. They're out on the road. That is the genesis of why I started this

62
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,520
paper. So I got otherwise commercially called the hydrogen

63
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,440
car. So since I wanted to like you know I have a long drive from East Bay to Palo

64
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,800
Alto. So I kept driving on a gasoline vehicles. I was feeling guilty. So I wanted to

65
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,360
get a zero emissions vehicle right. Everybody was going for electric.

66
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,600
So since I worked on these different kinds of transportation technologies I

67
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,920
wanted to see like how would it be to drive a hydrogen car.

68
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:50,040
So that was how my research started you know then I got a hydrogen car.

69
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,320
So the way things vehicles go ahead you had some questions.

70
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:00,120
I will say that I did not associate fuel cell and hydrogen. I very ignorant in that area.

71
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,600
I thought when I think of fuel cell I associate that with alternative battery technology

72
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,960
like that we might see in phones or computers or even cars and hydrogen.

73
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,960
I don't know how I envisioned thus getting the hydrogen into the cars but I did not

74
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,640
associate that with fuel cell and I did not realize that they were

75
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:26,920
broadly available today. Yeah see you know something. I need exactly right

76
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,440
fuel cell are similar to batteries. So the fuel cells work in a way

77
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,880
battery does like what it works in a Tesla or a bolt except that you

78
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,360
give hydrogen to fuel cells and then they convert that to electricity and that drives the car.

79
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,760
So they are essentially electric cars but then they need hydrogen to produce the

80
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,320
electricity that's the only difference. Okay. So the way they work is you know

81
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:58,600
California is the pioneer in this technology so they have about like 32 or 35 hydrogen

82
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,560
stations all over the state and Bay Area and Southern California are big in this network.

83
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,360
They have multiple stations. That's one of the main criteria to buy or you know to

84
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,760
lease a hydrogen vehicle. So I will get to the machine learning part in a bit.

85
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:18,680
Meaning from a consumer perspective if I don't find a fueling station I'm probably not

86
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,680
going to want to buy one of these. Exactly. And I imagine it's it's not like an electric vehicle

87
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,840
where I can just get a box and attach it to my house and you know be able to charge my car.

88
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:37,400
The hydrogen infrastructure at the home is non-existent. You don't want that. And dangerous.

89
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:44,600
Yes. Yeah. Exactly right. So that's why having a public hydrogen station is very important

90
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:47,800
and having a reliable public hydrogen station is very very important.

91
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:54,680
Fortunately I live in Union City so there is one in Fremont and there's one in Hayward

92
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,800
and I work in Palo Alto and there's one in Mountain View at the time when I got the car.

93
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:06,840
So I was very excited. So the fueling system is very similar to gasoline. So I was doing that.

94
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:13,080
And then over a period of time I realized like some stations do really badly in these.

95
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:19,400
Like you go there and then suddenly there's no fuel or there's line or you know there's

96
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,160
all sorts of problems. And then the other stations I started to rely more and more.

97
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:31,160
And I was looking for some kind of data for this. Like is there a data driven reliability that I

98
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,920
can actually look up so that when I want to refuel I can go there directly. And there wasn't one.

99
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:43,320
So I started collecting the data. So their California fuel self partnership is the agency that

100
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:50,680
provides this real-time hydrogen availability data online. So I scraped that data for three months

101
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:59,800
from September, October to December of last year. Every hour. And I wanted to see the time series

102
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,760
and do all those things to analyze where I can go refuel or where anyone can go refuel.

103
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,200
So I did that and then I got you know so when you get a zero emission vehicle you get

104
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,520
rebate from the state. If you are buying a Tesla or a Bolt you can get about $2,500.

105
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:25,000
And if you're getting a hydrogen car you get about $5,000. And that data is available to the public

106
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,840
anonymized of course. But you can see who got the rebate at a zip code level at census track level

107
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:39,640
even. So you can get a sense for vehicle density by zip code or census tract. Exactly. So

108
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,760
putting two and two together. So I have this state you fuel consumption data that I collected

109
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,880
or for a period of three months and all I have to match it with the demand and see whether there is

110
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,960
a trend. Obviously there was a trend and you could actually see which stations lag behind

111
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:04,200
and which stations are overstressed. Like for example if you draw a linear relationship between

112
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,160
demand and supply I was able to visualize in this case Mountain View was not used by people.

113
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,880
So it confirmed my instincts that Mountain View sucks in like I mean the station stops.

114
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:25,800
So I was happy about that but then I don't know by my own instinct alone. So I did a survey of

115
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,760
100 fuel cell drivers. So we have this Facebook group of hydrogen car drivers that we

116
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:37,720
talked to each other and you know talk about the fueling difficulties or whatever.

117
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:46,840
So I put out the question to them. I asked what are some brief seven questions on like what's

118
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:51,880
their favorite location, what's their least favorite location, what are the things they find

119
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:59,640
difficult to or why they avoid the station and so on. It so happened that many of them picked

120
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,880
Mountain View as a least favorite station because the one thing I felt which was confirmed by others

121
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:14,040
it had a different setup than other stations. So and it wasn't user friendly that was something

122
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:20,600
you know we couldn't have guessed just by looking at the data. And also other things like

123
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,160
you know some stations are overstressed because there are a lot of people queuing up. So which

124
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:30,920
kind of gives an indication that the station capacity could be increased over time in those places.

125
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:37,560
So I wrote this paper initially to suggest that to policymakers you know having this kind of

126
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:44,040
continuous monitoring mechanism would be able to help your you know data driven decisions over time

127
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,800
whether you want to increase the station capacity or do you want to include a new station in that

128
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:52,440
area because it's overstressed or if there's something wrong going on with it if there's unsafe

129
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,960
location or something different fuel setup it'll be able to identify where it's going on and then

130
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:04,760
you can fix it. So that was an interesting paper. So once I did that so it was published in

131
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,960
International Journal of Hydrogen Energy and then there was another sister paper that's.

132
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:16,440
And that paper specifically is the one titled an integrated quantitative qualitative study

133
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,000
to monitor the utilization and assess the perception of hydrogen fueling stations.

134
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,880
Yeah. So I wanted to capture everything in one.

135
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,800
Yeah it was a very fun paper to write because it was based out of my personal experience and

136
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:45,400
it's full of affirmations like I was right. And here you kind of describe the setup and what your

137
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:53,000
data sources are. One thing that jumps out at me from your personal experience is that there are

138
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,800
two sides to the demand equation. There's where the cars live but there's also the other side of

139
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:07,160
the commute where you're going. Were you able to find any data to incorporate that side of the

140
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:14,200
demand equation into your analysis? Yes. So remember the survey I mentioned. So that was one of the

141
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:20,440
questions to the drivers. So where do they feel and what was the reason why they choose that station?

142
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:29,560
For me I wanted it to be close to home because that's where I rely most. So or on the way to commute.

143
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:36,280
It so happened that about 70% of the people who answered that why they picked the station was

144
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:45,000
proximity to their house. So that was my assumption as well and that kind of validated this.

145
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,640
And of course this is just a preliminary way of analyzing things and there's always like you

146
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:56,520
mentioned this demand traffic demand time of day events and all those things that could factor

147
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:03,720
into these things. But for the initial checking the station performance overall in a broad period of

148
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,720
time I think this might be okay. Okay. So yeah so if you go through the paper I mean there are

149
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,640
these details steps on how I transform the time series into one single metric and all those

150
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:22,760
details if you like. I can go back to that. And that's in the quantitative qualitative paper?

151
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:32,040
Yes. Yes. So this initial paper was kind of talking broadly about this problem and integrating

152
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:38,440
the both the quantitative approaches and the qualitative survey that you did but then you did

153
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,760
another paper that really focused in on the quantitative side and in particular the application

154
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:49,560
of machine learning to this problem or an application of machine learning to this problem.

155
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:58,440
Right. So since I have access to this spatial temporal data so it was rich in terms of like

156
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,280
whatever data I collected for three months so it's a very ripe data set to explore different

157
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,120
kinds of problems. In this case I wanted to see if I can do some kind of temporal clustering

158
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:17,960
to identify the signatures of the usage of these stations over time. So I used a temporal clustering

159
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:24,040
mechanism. So I was able to find out since I had access to the qualitative survey I was able to

160
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:30,600
even interpret the results that came out of this model. And so talk a little bit more about the

161
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:38,360
temporal clustering approach that you used. What exactly was your objective and what specific

162
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:45,400
techniques did you apply? So the objective was to identify if just by looking at the station

163
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:51,640
consumption will we be able to see whether can we group these stations into different categories

164
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:58,200
which the paper describes how it's being done. So I identified like five categories from

165
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:04,200
the signature of these temporal usage. So the method I followed is something called complexity

166
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:10,600
invariant temporal clustering. So I got this from a research paper. So the idea behind that is

167
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:20,920
for use cases and finance or anything any domain related temporal use cases you can actually

168
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:29,960
find the signatures and in terms of complexities. So you can do clustering of these signatures based

169
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:37,160
on that and I was able to find five groups of those. So one is the healthy range where we think

170
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,160
the stations perform pretty well. And then the other group is the overstressed where there are beings

171
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,360
you know a lot of people go there more than the predicted demand. And another is where the problem

172
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:55,640
stations where people do not go and they have a different standards of reporting and such.

173
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,240
And the other are like connector stations and the connector stations are those that are placed

174
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:09,880
somewhere in between the high demand and low demand stations. So this method I tried with different

175
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,760
kinds of clustering methods and this one the complexity invariant method seemed to perform well

176
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:22,440
and we were able to hierarchically group these stations into different categories.

177
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:30,200
Okay so you applied this clustering technique and you're specifically trying to cluster

178
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:40,280
in in time series and then use the these clusters to identify the specific essentially

179
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:49,640
categorize the types of fueling stations. Is that right? Yeah if you recall my previous paper so

180
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:56,440
that identified the relationship between supply and demand. So in this case we are just using

181
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:05,240
the supply side to identify any problem stations. So by problem stations I mean since I have the

182
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:11,960
survey data I can tell they are problem stations. So otherwise they are grouped into these different

183
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,520
categories different buckets of stations like there will be like majority of stations

184
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:22,040
falling into like healthy range bucket and then there there are these groups of five or six stations

185
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:29,400
that falling into overstressed or underperforming. So the interpretation comes from the qualitative

186
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,040
method that I did but then this involved performing the analysis even without involving the demand

187
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:44,120
of people. So even if the number of stations scale up in the future we don't have to worry about

188
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,640
who is buying where or who is refueling where that will answer your previous question as well.

189
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:55,560
So just by looking at the signature of these station usage we can see whether it's performing

190
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:01,640
in a healthy way or something is wrong with it. And you just referenced the qualitative survey

191
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,160
results but I'm noting the paper this particular paper that we're talking about is unsupervised

192
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,560
temporal clustering to monitor the performance of alternative fueling infrastructure.

193
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:22,760
So you but you so you didn't use the the qualitative results or of these stations as labels.

194
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:29,560
No no. Okay. Yeah no labeling done. So we're clustering the stations first and then the qualitative

195
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:35,400
part comes only in interpreting those clusters. You essentially created a way to

196
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:43,320
for a regulatory or a government agency or somebody that cares about this to just look at the time

197
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:50,760
series performance of these stations and their utilization and assess them. Yeah. So yeah exactly.

198
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,680
So the idea behind this is like California plans on installing 100 of these hydrogen stations

199
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:06,040
in a before 2025 right that's one of the plans to climate change goal plans. So if that's going

200
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:14,840
to happen we have to make sure people rely on these stations and that is a part of you know building

201
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,240
the reliability because one of the biggest fears like you mentioned earlier like if I have to buy

202
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:26,120
a hydrogen car it the proximity alone doesn't matter but I need to have a reliable station like if I

203
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:30,920
go there I need to be able to refuel that's one of the biggest fears behind adopting hydrogen

204
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:35,320
vehicles and that's the reason behind you know going after electric because you can charge at home.

205
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:42,360
So I think for you know reducing emissions we need to follow both technologies for diversity and to

206
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:50,280
adhere to compliance and adhere to follow reliable solutions or you know throw out reliable

207
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:57,080
solutions to public we need to have these kind of mechanisms in place and this is one of the projects

208
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:02,120
like I didn't see anything happening in the policy area and so once I wrote the paper I sent it

209
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,960
out to California fields of partnership and they were really interested in seeing this further.

210
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:11,240
That's awesome. That's awesome. It does track me that once the station is built it's a little bit too

211
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,480
late. Can you envision applying you know either the techniques similar to the ones you've written

212
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:26,520
about or other machine learning techniques to do this more predictively to for example determine

213
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:33,800
where the the next 50 to 70 station should go? I think it can happen because the stations are

214
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:41,320
pretty sparse right now so for example if if Fremont is having more traffic than usual then it

215
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:46,680
is it would be easy to identify where it's coming from and then you know the next station placement

216
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:53,160
can be made nearby so that it alleviates that or the station capacity can be increased pretty quickly

217
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:00,040
that doesn't need a lot of infrastructure cost so it is just a matter of delivering it more

218
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,800
frequently. So yeah so I think those are the low cost solutions that can help in the meantime

219
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,280
to help people adopt more zero emission vehicles. And you mentioned earlier in the conversation

220
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:17,400
I believe as one of your assumptions a linear relationship between

221
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:27,960
demand and consumption. Did your paper validate that assumption or did you challenge that assumption

222
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,960
within your research? So I did validate that I ran all the linear regression assumptions within

223
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:41,240
there but I also mentioned that within the paper since it's a sparse placement of stations maybe

224
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:47,960
this simple relationship is okay for now but as the add more the relationship might not be linear

225
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,840
so we have to be careful to extend this to future use cases if you know we can't just assume the

226
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:02,280
same factors will apply when we add more so it is a scalable solution but we need to be careful of

227
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:09,160
what we are doing. Cool so it sounds like this paper was in a lot of ways a passion project

228
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:16,520
but also ties into your research at part. Can you talk a little bit about the connection and more

229
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:23,560
broadly the types of research you're going after at the research center? Yeah so actually I have to

230
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,760
say this is completely my passion project it was not the one that I did at part and you can see why

231
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:34,760
right because I was getting frustrated with the station usage and such. So at part I have been

232
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:42,040
working on different kinds of projects so I'm within the machine learning group at part

233
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,880
and there are different kinds of labs you know one for computer vision natural language

234
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,560
you know sensor systems and we have printed electronics they're all part of hardware labs

235
00:23:54,920 --> 00:24:03,080
so my favorite thing about that is I work horizontally across all these labs so I'm able to

236
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:09,080
pick and work on what I like so some of the interesting projects that I've done so far which

237
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:16,120
are not related to transportation or energy as I developed a graphic design art generation

238
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:25,320
using deep learning so we did that for a client who wanted to generate you know these designs fast

239
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:30,520
on a scalable basis so we had to deploy these deep learning models onto the cloud.

240
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:36,840
What kind of designs are we talking about? So I published or worked something called intricate

241
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:44,360
design intricate deep transfer design so it is like a similar to style transfer where we have

242
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,920
a painting and a content where you know the outcome would be a picture that looks like a painting

243
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:59,800
in this case I'm using a silhouette as a content and any pattern and in the place of design

244
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:06,920
style and then the outcome would be these patterns divided into new kind of chunks

245
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,320
so that the output looks abstract at the same time it fits the shape of the silhouette.

246
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:20,680
So if you look up I think there will be one called deep quilted Darth Vader which is one of my

247
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:29,000
signature words so I gave a quilt design and then Darth Vader's silhouette as a content and then

248
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:36,120
the output looks you know as if the quilt is stitched at the edges of the Darth Vader as if it's

249
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,640
quilted and it is different from cutting and pasting it because you know if you cut it the

250
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:48,360
finish won't be nice so we're using this kind of style transfer for that. There are other examples

251
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,840
also like this one more thing I did that has a stained glass effect like if you use a geometric

252
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:58,440
style it leads to a stained glass effect so I tried with different kinds of patterns and that was

253
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:05,880
one of my pioneer projects at park so you know you can see like I worked on different kinds of

254
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:12,920
domains there and I also remember you're also a comic artist so this is also tying into your

255
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:22,360
passions. Yeah exactly yeah so yeah art is something so the way I say it like two things stick me

256
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,640
it's math and art so this was very cool because I was able to combine two of these things.

257
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:33,800
You mentioned a client came to you are there commercial applications that you can talk about of

258
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:44,120
this kind of work? Yeah so the client is a Xerox company so they wanted they are like marketing

259
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:49,240
designed company so they wanted to see if they can produce personalized designs

260
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:56,760
depending on the color or graphic types and such so and they really liked it because it was

261
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,160
able to do that those things so if you have a logo you'll be able to generate something

262
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:09,800
personalized to you that is the idea behind this. Yeah and you also worked with more projects

263
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:15,720
in the computer vision group on in an augmented reality assistant so I designed an object detection

264
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:22,520
algorithm for them and also with the dialogue systems in the with the chat group and currently

265
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:29,560
I'm putting together my research agenda to do the combined work of you know hardware and software

266
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:34,920
expertise within park so the idea is to create so at hardware labs we produce a lot of sensors

267
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:41,480
printed electronics and such so I'm exploring to see how we can use those technologies with machine

268
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:48,040
learning and you know it can be applied in immediate use cases but I'm looking at energy and climate

269
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:56,040
areas and you have some kind of visibility into or specific ideas into how they apply to energy

270
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:01,880
and climate that you can share with us. For now we are just exploring things but there could be

271
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:09,640
any number of use cases right for example agriculture is a big one so if you have so park does

272
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:18,040
a lot of low cost sensors so it can be combined with machine learning to identify what are the

273
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:25,720
some crops that can be grown in a specific region or even in a we have a project on carbon

274
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,600
capture so you know we can use all these carbon sensors humidity sensors and temperature sensors

275
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:36,520
to identify where are the right locations for those and how can we verify that carbon is being

276
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:43,240
captured and so on so it is still very very new like it's in the ideation phase so I'm still

277
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,560
putting together a lot of things and of course transportation is a big one among them as well

278
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:55,320
so we are we are trying to see so there is freedom to do set our own to search agenda at park

279
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:01,880
within reason so that it has you know relevant business use cases too so I'm trying to match those

280
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:07,400
two together sounds like a fun place to be yeah it's great a lot of smart people

281
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,440
yeah and people some people have been there since the 1970s since park was formed so it's great

282
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:20,280
to have all their wisdom yeah so it's very nice to be there awesome awesome well collide thanks so
