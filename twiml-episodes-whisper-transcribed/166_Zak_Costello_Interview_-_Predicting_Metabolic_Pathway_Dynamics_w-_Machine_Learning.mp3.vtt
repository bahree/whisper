00:00.000 --> 00:16.320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

00:16.320 --> 00:21.480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:21.480 --> 00:31.080
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:31.080 --> 00:36.520
In today's episode, I'm joined by Zach Costello, host doctoral fellow at the Joint Bioenergy

00:36.520 --> 00:38.360
Institute.

00:38.360 --> 00:43.280
Zach joined me to discuss his recent paper, a machine learning approach to predict metabolic

00:43.280 --> 00:48.160
pathway dynamics from time series multiomics data.

00:48.160 --> 00:53.320
In our conversation, we start with an overview of synthetic biology and from there dig into

00:53.320 --> 00:58.480
Zach's particular application, which is the use of ML techniques to optimize metabolic

00:58.480 --> 01:03.080
reactions for engineering biofuels at scale.

01:03.080 --> 01:07.360
We get into an interesting chat about biohacking as well at the end of our interview.

01:07.360 --> 01:11.280
It turns out it's pretty easy for hobbyists to get started in this type of work, which

01:11.280 --> 01:15.240
is pretty wild.

01:15.240 --> 01:20.320
For the interview, remember that the next Twimble online meetup is coming up next Tuesday.

01:20.320 --> 01:24.880
Nick Teague will lead a discussion on the paper Quantum Machine Learning, which explores

01:24.880 --> 01:28.760
creating quantum software for machine learning tasks.

01:28.760 --> 01:33.600
Visit twimlai.com slash meetup for more details or to register.

01:33.600 --> 01:35.240
Enjoy.

01:35.240 --> 01:40.840
Alright everyone, I am on the line with Zach Costello.

01:40.840 --> 01:45.840
Zach is a postdoctoral fellow at the Joint Bioenergy Institute.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.280
Zach, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

01:48.280 --> 01:50.440
Hi, happy to be here.

01:50.440 --> 01:54.400
Why don't we get started by having you tell us a little bit about your background and

01:54.400 --> 01:57.800
how it led you to working on machine learning?

01:57.800 --> 01:58.800
Absolutely, yeah.

01:58.800 --> 02:04.520
So I'm a researcher whose goal is to sort of advance the transition of biology into an

02:04.520 --> 02:06.040
engineering discipline.

02:06.040 --> 02:11.520
I spend my time solving challenging problems in synthetic biology where I apply a various

02:11.520 --> 02:16.600
set of skills that I've developed over my education, like machine learning, control theory,

02:16.600 --> 02:21.960
applied mathematics more generally, and robotic automation.

02:21.960 --> 02:27.280
My work is kind of situated in between biological theory and practice so that the techniques

02:27.280 --> 02:31.600
I develop can be validated by either me or my colleagues in the lab.

02:31.600 --> 02:36.440
And whenever I undertake a project, the goal is to sort of advance the idea of creating

02:36.440 --> 02:42.560
a world where organisms can be engineered predictably, rapidly, and at low cost.

02:42.560 --> 02:48.160
In terms of my education, I started out actually as an electrical engineer where I focused

02:48.160 --> 02:51.720
on electromagnetics as an undergraduate.

02:51.720 --> 02:56.680
And then I took a position in between that at the Georgia Tech Research Institute where

02:56.680 --> 03:03.120
I kind of did a little bit of biological application and I started to get into some sort, some

03:03.120 --> 03:06.720
classification problems involving that.

03:06.720 --> 03:10.160
But for me, during my education, one of the guiding principles was to sort of pick the

03:10.160 --> 03:14.600
best teacher over the coolest problem so I could learn as much as possible and as deeply

03:14.600 --> 03:15.600
as possible.

03:15.600 --> 03:18.920
I figure there's like fascinating problems everywhere.

03:18.920 --> 03:23.600
And so, you know, in that vein, I kind of did a little bit of a switch up for my PhD and

03:23.600 --> 03:29.040
was in a swarm robotics lab under my advisor, Magnus Agerstead, who is just an excellent

03:29.040 --> 03:34.760
teacher and the theoretical focus in the lab there was a network control theory.

03:34.760 --> 03:39.800
And my PhD was focused on studying what a certain class of network dynamical systems could

03:39.800 --> 03:40.640
compute.

03:40.640 --> 03:45.120
And the fundamental question here was how do you do computation when you actually don't

03:45.120 --> 03:46.840
have any leaders in charge of it?

03:46.840 --> 03:50.200
So there's no single thing orchestrating it.

03:50.200 --> 03:54.280
And there are certain places computers can't go, but they still have to process information

03:54.280 --> 03:56.120
and react to complex environments.

03:56.120 --> 04:00.440
So in some sense, even then, I had biological applications in mind.

04:00.440 --> 04:05.200
And one particular example I was always thinking about is how cells can coordinate to compute.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.200
And I figured once I finished my doctorate, though I either need to start working in biology

04:08.200 --> 04:10.360
or I'd never really find my way in.

04:10.360 --> 04:16.440
So for my postdoc, I made the transition into synthetic biology and I'm doing my postdoc

04:16.440 --> 04:20.920
now at the Joint Bioenergy Institute in the quantitative metabolic modeling group under

04:20.920 --> 04:25.560
Dr. Hector Garcia Martin, who has been an excellent advocate for the integration of mathematics,

04:25.560 --> 04:29.600
machine learning and automation and synthetic biology where it's still pretty nascent.

04:29.600 --> 04:34.040
And this is where I actually started doing my work formally in machine learning.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.560
I picked up machine learning as the way to speed up the rate at which I could deal with

04:37.560 --> 04:42.520
the complex subject of synthetic biology because I did not have a biological background.

04:42.520 --> 04:46.760
I work with really talented chemical engineers and biochemists and I just won't be able

04:46.760 --> 04:50.720
to compete for probably another few years on raw biological knowledge.

04:50.720 --> 04:54.480
So for me, the machine learning provided a way of handling some of that complexity and

04:54.480 --> 04:57.880
giving me the ability to contribute where I was still developing skills.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.360
So I love that.

04:59.360 --> 05:05.960
I often, you know, in talking to people about machine learning and AI, refer to it as

05:05.960 --> 05:12.040
a superpower that eventually gives folks who wielded a tremendous advantage and your

05:12.040 --> 05:14.640
story is kind of a great example of that.

05:14.640 --> 05:21.480
Tell us a little bit more about synthetic bio and what are the kinds of problems you're

05:21.480 --> 05:22.480
working on there.

05:22.480 --> 05:23.800
Yeah, absolutely.

05:23.800 --> 05:30.040
So the way I think about it is when any science becomes sufficiently mature, it sort of

05:30.040 --> 05:34.080
births a corresponding engineering discipline.

05:34.080 --> 05:38.720
And so in this case, biology has accumulated a lot of different knowledge over the years

05:38.720 --> 05:44.280
and these are sort of in the form of individual properties of different parts of biology.

05:44.280 --> 05:49.120
And synthetic biology is maybe just a rebranding of genetic engineering, but the aim is to make

05:49.120 --> 05:55.480
biological systems predictably engineerable so that you can solve an array of human challenges.

05:55.480 --> 06:02.480
And for me specifically, I work in sort of a sub discipline of that called metabolic engineering.

06:02.480 --> 06:07.080
And in metabolic engineering, we aim to add reactions to metabolisms, to make molecules

06:07.080 --> 06:09.040
that are useful to people.

06:09.040 --> 06:14.640
So some examples of those might be fuels, pharmaceuticals, or biomaterials, say spider

06:14.640 --> 06:17.720
silk or plastics.

06:17.720 --> 06:21.920
And maybe just to sort of, I think there's probably one key analogy that people can kind

06:21.920 --> 06:26.880
of key in on to understand what's going on in the context of the conversation I think

06:26.880 --> 06:29.640
we're likely to have going forward.

06:29.640 --> 06:34.240
And so I think maybe one of your guests mentioned this before, the central dogma of biology

06:34.240 --> 06:40.400
is kind of important here, which is DNA is transcribed into RNA, RNA is translated into

06:40.400 --> 06:41.920
proteins.

06:41.920 --> 06:46.760
In metabolic engineering, proteins are used to catalyze reactions and so we add reactions

06:46.760 --> 06:49.360
to an organism to make new chemicals.

06:49.360 --> 06:55.200
And sort of a good way to think about metabolism as a whole is say a subway system.

06:55.200 --> 07:01.600
So if you imagine the subway system in the Bay area, each station would represent a particular

07:01.600 --> 07:05.440
chemical that's present in the body for an important reason.

07:05.440 --> 07:10.280
And then those are connected through tunnels between these stations.

07:10.280 --> 07:14.760
So if you want to get from say San Francisco to Oakland, there might be a series of stops.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.880
Now the tunnels that connect it are actually the proteins here.

07:17.880 --> 07:22.480
So as we produce protein in the body, what we're actually doing, or produce protein in

07:22.480 --> 07:25.960
a particular organism, what we're actually doing is sort of providing the track to allow

07:25.960 --> 07:28.800
us to go from one metabolite to another.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.000
And in metabolic engineering, it's like a build out.

07:32.000 --> 07:36.400
So we have an organism that already has sort of like a subway station like layout.

07:36.400 --> 07:41.360
And we're finding the closest station where we have to build out to a particular molecule.

07:41.360 --> 07:45.360
And then we find the proteins that will allow us to sort of build out there.

07:45.360 --> 07:52.360
So the idea is that you've got proteins or what allow you to create these metabolites

07:52.360 --> 07:55.840
that create some chemical reaction within the body that's desired.

07:55.840 --> 08:00.840
And you're trying to engineer the protein so that you can goose the creation of these

08:00.840 --> 08:01.840
metabolites.

08:01.840 --> 08:02.840
Is that the idea?

08:02.840 --> 08:03.840
Yeah, in a sense.

08:03.840 --> 08:06.920
So a lot of times we don't necessarily even create the protein.

08:06.920 --> 08:12.720
So what we might do when we're building a particular strain, a J. Bay, we build different

08:12.720 --> 08:18.320
strains of microorganisms by, and we add to their metabolism.

08:18.320 --> 08:21.160
We might look across all domains of life.

08:21.160 --> 08:27.240
So we might borrow from mint, breweries, yeast, evergreen trees.

08:27.240 --> 08:31.040
And inside of all these organisms are tons of different proteins.

08:31.040 --> 08:33.800
And each protein, you can think of it just like a little nano machine.

08:33.800 --> 08:35.760
I mean, that's what they are.

08:35.760 --> 08:40.040
That basically is a factory for turning one chemical into another.

08:40.040 --> 08:44.440
And so we'll scour these things across life and essentially borrow the important machines

08:44.440 --> 08:49.120
that each one has painstakingly developed over the many years of its evolution and put

08:49.120 --> 08:52.800
them into our organism of interest so that they can actually make that thing.

08:52.800 --> 08:58.360
Is that that aspect of a protein, kind of this micro machine idea?

08:58.360 --> 09:02.960
Is that fundamental to what a protein is or kind of a side product of the way they

09:02.960 --> 09:05.000
exist or how they're used in the body?

09:05.000 --> 09:07.160
Oh, that's absolutely fundamental.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.520
So every enzyme does this.

09:09.520 --> 09:14.840
And in fact, there's a great deal of really cool YouTube videos out there that show sort

09:14.840 --> 09:17.680
of how much like machines they actually are.

09:17.680 --> 09:21.880
I think that oftentimes people kind of think of them very abstractly, but they're doing

09:21.880 --> 09:23.640
physical things.

09:23.640 --> 09:28.320
So for example, there are proteins that literally walk along these structures inside of your

09:28.320 --> 09:29.920
cells called actin fibers.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.280
They're essentially the skeleton.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.280
But it's like a highway.

09:32.280 --> 09:35.520
So you've got these little proteins and they've got these two little molecular legs and

09:35.520 --> 09:38.640
they're literally walking along at Dragon Cargo.

09:38.640 --> 09:42.440
I mean, inside the human body, it's just, it's molecular clockwork.

09:42.440 --> 09:43.960
It's incredibly complex.

09:43.960 --> 09:44.960
Wow.

09:44.960 --> 09:45.960
Wow.

09:45.960 --> 09:46.960
Yeah.

09:46.960 --> 09:50.120
So maybe talk through a specific example.

09:50.120 --> 09:54.960
You're working on specific metabolic pathways in your research.

09:54.960 --> 09:55.960
Is that right?

09:55.960 --> 09:57.560
Yeah, absolutely.

09:57.560 --> 10:04.680
One of the ones that, while we deal with two in the paper, in a recent paper, republished,

10:04.680 --> 10:12.240
and one of them is producing a molecule called Lymanine, which is a candidate fuel molecule.

10:12.240 --> 10:17.200
Lymanine is a major component of citrus fruit oils and is actually used as a fragrance.

10:17.200 --> 10:21.280
If you were to smell it, it has like a lemony scent.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.640
But it also turns out it can be used as a fuel.

10:23.640 --> 10:27.600
You can burn it and make your car go.

10:27.600 --> 10:32.080
And in this case, yeah, so we, like I was saying before, we borrowed several different

10:32.080 --> 10:33.080
proteins.

10:33.080 --> 10:37.520
And I think actually the examples I gave you before were for this particular strain.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.880
For mint and brewers, yeast and evergreen trees, they're about 10 proteins.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.520
We had to add to this organism.

10:43.520 --> 10:48.680
And the goal here is to basically take these organisms once you've genetically modified

10:48.680 --> 10:49.680
them.

10:49.680 --> 10:53.480
And you put them through a similar process that you brew beer with.

10:53.480 --> 10:58.720
So essentially you put them in this broth, which contains the sugars they need to live.

10:58.720 --> 11:00.360
And then you let them grow up.

11:00.360 --> 11:04.640
And in the process of growing, they release their metabolite.

11:04.640 --> 11:07.240
So your Lymanine, you make a lot of that.

11:07.240 --> 11:10.520
If your strain is good, they make as much as possible.

11:10.520 --> 11:15.440
And you'll actually be able to just skim that off the top or find a way of isolating

11:15.440 --> 11:16.840
it pretty easily.

11:16.840 --> 11:17.840
And then you're good.

11:17.840 --> 11:22.520
So a lot of the problems that we deal with in metabolic engineering involve maximizing

11:22.520 --> 11:26.880
the production of a particular biomolecule so that we can extract it and use it.

11:26.880 --> 11:33.920
And so you mentioned a bunch of substances, mint and other things.

11:33.920 --> 11:42.240
Are these needed to be put into, like, in proportion into this concoction, or are you,

11:42.240 --> 11:46.280
is it, you know, you've got your trying, you know, just mint or just something else and

11:46.280 --> 11:50.240
just something else and seeing which ones you can kind of get the most of this Lymanate

11:50.240 --> 11:51.240
from?

11:51.240 --> 11:52.240
Oh, so yeah.

11:52.240 --> 11:56.280
So what we do is we actually never use those organisms.

11:56.280 --> 12:01.400
We look in their genomes and we pull out parts of their genetic code.

12:01.400 --> 12:05.200
And that part of the genetic code codes for the particular nano-machine of interest

12:05.200 --> 12:06.640
inside of those organisms.

12:06.640 --> 12:11.040
So then we take out, you know, we'll take a protein from men to protein from brewers

12:11.040 --> 12:13.480
used to protein from evergreen trees.

12:13.480 --> 12:19.280
And then we will put that in our organism of interest and put that DNA in there and it

12:19.280 --> 12:23.520
will learn how to make though it then from that DNA, it's able to use that as a blueprint

12:23.520 --> 12:28.360
to make the proteins that it needs to actually make Lymanate, which is our compound of interest.

12:28.360 --> 12:33.520
But the challenging part is to make sure you get the proportions of all those proteins

12:33.520 --> 12:34.520
correct.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.520
Yeah.

12:35.520 --> 12:39.360
And in this particular example, the organism of interest is absolutely.

12:39.360 --> 12:40.360
Yeah.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.640
So in this study, we were using E. coli.

12:43.640 --> 12:50.200
E. coli is just one of the standard model organisms in synthetic biology.

12:50.200 --> 12:54.560
The reason we use it is because it has a lot of genetic tools and it's been studied.

12:54.560 --> 13:00.680
So it's easy to use things like CRISPR-Cas9, based systems for integrating things and it's

13:00.680 --> 13:06.280
easy to get DNA out into the organism and it's pretty easy to grow and it grows quickly.

13:06.280 --> 13:14.800
So E. coli is this, you know, it's basically like a macro machine, if you will.

13:14.800 --> 13:20.880
And your process is changing some of its micro machinery to let it do different things.

13:20.880 --> 13:27.800
And you kind of inject these proteins or add these proteins to it to get it to be better

13:27.800 --> 13:29.960
at producing a particular result for you.

13:29.960 --> 13:30.960
Yeah, exactly.

13:30.960 --> 13:36.400
So yeah, we're just adding things to it to help to change its metabolism so it can make

13:36.400 --> 13:38.320
our target compound 100%.

13:38.320 --> 13:39.320
Awesome.

13:39.320 --> 13:44.800
And so how does machine learning and data science fit into all that?

13:44.800 --> 13:45.800
Oh, yeah.

13:45.800 --> 13:51.560
This is, so there's a few challenges actually that people, so when we're trying to actually

13:51.560 --> 13:56.640
put things into these organisms, we have to figure out sort of what proportions we ultimately

13:56.640 --> 13:59.880
want the proteins to be at, right?

13:59.880 --> 14:04.400
We want, and we also want to understand the dynamic behavior of these organisms.

14:04.400 --> 14:11.120
So in order to do that traditionally, it was a very, very complicated process.

14:11.120 --> 14:17.640
You need a domain expert and that domain expert has to write down very complicated differential

14:17.640 --> 14:22.800
equations which describe the dynamic behavior of this system.

14:22.800 --> 14:27.480
And so, you know, we actually went through the process and did that, but it turns out

14:27.480 --> 14:32.200
that it's really hard to do this well enough because oftentimes the information you need

14:32.200 --> 14:34.840
to build that model isn't present in the literature.

14:34.840 --> 14:35.840
So you have to guess.

14:35.840 --> 14:40.400
You have to make a lot of guessing and you create a very structured model.

14:40.400 --> 14:46.800
But we saw an opportunity to, instead of just building these models by hand, find a way

14:46.800 --> 14:52.440
to use machine learning so that we didn't have to make any assumptions about the structure

14:52.440 --> 14:55.800
of the dynamics of these systems.

14:55.800 --> 15:02.160
And okay, so maybe the best way to go here is sort of to a 30,000 foot view of what

15:02.160 --> 15:05.920
we were trying to do in that paper, does that sound reasonable?

15:05.920 --> 15:06.920
Sure.

15:06.920 --> 15:07.920
Okay, cool.

15:07.920 --> 15:14.200
So, once we actually had, so in our case, we were trying to use time series data to actually

15:14.200 --> 15:17.840
figure out what the dynamic behavior of these systems were.

15:17.840 --> 15:23.760
And the problem, I think, can be phrased pretty simply, which is, let's say I give you,

15:23.760 --> 15:26.560
so imagine a ball and a hill.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.760
And the hill can have any kind of shape.

15:28.760 --> 15:33.040
Maybe it's oblong, maybe it's bumpy, maybe it's tall or short.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.040
You don't really know.

15:34.040 --> 15:39.840
But I'm going to give you a set of trajectories for how the ball rolls down the hill, given

15:39.840 --> 15:40.840
different starting points.

15:40.840 --> 15:44.920
So I'm going to put the ball maybe at the top and maybe somewhere down the side of this

15:44.920 --> 15:45.920
hill.

15:45.920 --> 15:49.120
And then I'm going to give you just what it looks like for the ball to roll down the

15:49.120 --> 15:50.120
hill.

15:50.120 --> 15:55.600
And essentially what we were trying to do is, given all these time series data sets, can

15:55.600 --> 15:57.280
you actually reconstruct the hill?

15:57.280 --> 16:00.200
Can you tell me what the hill looks like?

16:00.200 --> 16:07.440
And in that way, we can actually figure out how the entire system will behave regardless

16:07.440 --> 16:11.040
of the setup of the proteins in the cell.

16:11.040 --> 16:13.480
So we're actually able to determine production.

16:13.480 --> 16:18.720
We're able to simulate all these cells without actually having a model a priori defined.

16:18.720 --> 16:27.480
So this hill analogy, I think, will be familiar to many or most listeners from kind of conversations

16:27.480 --> 16:32.360
around gradient descent and finding local optima on the hill.

16:32.360 --> 16:36.520
It sounds like you're doing something a little different, which is trying to capture the

16:36.520 --> 16:37.520
hill itself.

16:37.520 --> 16:38.520
Exactly.

16:38.520 --> 16:39.520
Yeah.

16:39.520 --> 16:43.920
So we figure with time series data, what you have is this relationship for how something

16:43.920 --> 16:45.840
moves.

16:45.840 --> 16:52.600
And in our case, when you have the whole of metabolism, it's this very complicated dynamic

16:52.600 --> 16:53.600
process.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.240
And we want to understand.

16:55.240 --> 16:59.920
And when I say dynamic process, all that I mean is that let's say we know something about

16:59.920 --> 17:07.080
what chemicals are present at, what concentrations in the cell at this particular moment, then

17:07.080 --> 17:11.320
I should be able to tell you, at the next moment, what those chemical compositions are

17:11.320 --> 17:14.520
going to look like based on the state of the cell.

17:14.520 --> 17:19.800
And so if we have time series, essentially, we have examples of all those transitions.

17:19.800 --> 17:24.680
And we can back out, essentially, what should happen more generally if we have enough

17:24.680 --> 17:26.560
of those transitions.

17:26.560 --> 17:30.760
And the time series data that you have is what, in particular?

17:30.760 --> 17:31.760
Yeah.

17:31.760 --> 17:41.120
So we had initially a really great data set, which I think by most, compared to most of

17:41.120 --> 17:44.280
the guests here is probably very small.

17:44.280 --> 17:51.640
But this data set contained a total of six different strains.

17:51.640 --> 17:56.800
And each of those strains had a time series set of measurements for both proteins.

17:56.800 --> 17:57.880
So those are the machines.

17:57.880 --> 18:00.320
So we have protein concentrations.

18:00.320 --> 18:02.200
And we have metabolite concentrations.

18:02.200 --> 18:07.520
So these are all sort of the intermediate stations between where, you know, using going

18:07.520 --> 18:13.040
back to the analogy for the subway station, there's sort of the intermediate chemical stations

18:13.040 --> 18:17.120
between where I am in metabolism and where I want to go.

18:17.120 --> 18:22.280
So I've got these two separate concentrations for a set of time points.

18:22.280 --> 18:27.080
And what I'm trying to do is predict what happens to the metabolites at the very next time

18:27.080 --> 18:28.320
point.

18:28.320 --> 18:29.320
Okay.

18:29.320 --> 18:35.640
And the, maybe going back to the analogy of the hill, the hill then represents, is it

18:35.640 --> 18:42.880
your ability to predict forward at any point in time or is it, is it something else?

18:42.880 --> 18:44.160
No, you're exactly right.

18:44.160 --> 18:48.480
So if you know the hill, right, you can put the ball down anywhere and you can tell me

18:48.480 --> 18:49.480
what happens next.

18:49.480 --> 18:55.320
And the same way, if you know how a strain starts out its life, I can tell you how it's

18:55.320 --> 18:56.320
going to evolve.

18:56.320 --> 19:00.200
And ultimately, how much limony that will end up producing over time.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.360
And we can also look to see if there's any problems.

19:02.360 --> 19:07.560
As these metabolites change, they can signal toxicity issues or other problems that want

19:07.560 --> 19:10.720
to address in the metabolic engineering process.

19:10.720 --> 19:16.400
So it gives us a lot of information if we can sort of do these experiments in silico.

19:16.400 --> 19:24.560
Maybe it's also worth making some points about how there are challenges in synthetic biology

19:24.560 --> 19:30.640
with machine learning and sort of what are some unique things that we face.

19:30.640 --> 19:35.920
Before we do that, maybe talk a little bit about the kind of the method, right?

19:35.920 --> 19:43.320
So you've got this time series data that you captured you're trying to ultimately characterize

19:43.320 --> 19:49.160
the complex behavior of the system with that time series data.

19:49.160 --> 19:51.760
How did you get from the data to the characterization?

19:51.760 --> 19:53.360
What was your overall process?

19:53.360 --> 19:54.360
Yeah.

19:54.360 --> 19:55.360
Okay.

19:55.360 --> 19:59.200
So you have this data, like I said before.

19:59.200 --> 20:04.120
And from these time series, essentially what we do is we smooth it out because we actually

20:04.120 --> 20:06.840
have not that many time points.

20:06.840 --> 20:12.680
And then we calculate the time derivatives for each of the metabolites on this path.

20:12.680 --> 20:20.840
And so that gives us this relationship between the metabolites at a given time to the metabolites

20:20.840 --> 20:22.440
at the next instant in time.

20:22.440 --> 20:29.200
So in other words, how does the internal chemical state of the cell change at each unit in

20:29.200 --> 20:31.200
that particular time series?

20:31.200 --> 20:38.880
And once or these are, do you think of these metabolites, these are like partial derivatives

20:38.880 --> 20:41.760
of this equation that you're ultimately trying to figure out?

20:41.760 --> 20:43.800
Yeah, just time derivatives, yeah.

20:43.800 --> 20:49.720
So we have time derivatives of these, we have time derivatives of these metabolic paths

20:49.720 --> 20:50.720
through time.

20:50.720 --> 20:57.560
And then each metabolite state derivative pair, including, and also their proteins are

20:57.560 --> 21:04.440
included in the features for each of these at each time point represents one example that

21:04.440 --> 21:05.560
will feed to our model.

21:05.560 --> 21:12.000
And so essentially from the three or six time series, we're able to expand that out.

21:12.000 --> 21:16.800
And since if we've sampled enough along that curve, then we can actually augment the

21:16.800 --> 21:22.600
data set and produce on the order of say maybe a hundred examples for each one of those,

21:22.600 --> 21:25.800
each one of those complete time series curves.

21:25.800 --> 21:30.080
So it's still relatively small in terms of the total amount of data we have to work

21:30.080 --> 21:31.080
with.

21:31.080 --> 21:32.080
Okay.

21:32.080 --> 21:38.120
So you've got your input features are basically these time series derivatives.

21:38.120 --> 21:44.000
And then you're using these to predict the overall system characteristics.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.360
What kind of models did you, are you applying to this?

21:48.360 --> 21:54.360
Yeah, so because we have sort of limited data, we use more traditional machine learning

21:54.360 --> 21:56.600
approaches.

21:56.600 --> 22:02.520
And for us, that meant, you know, random forest, so ensemble tree-based approaches.

22:02.520 --> 22:08.600
We actually used one of the freely available meta learners, this package called T-POT,

22:08.600 --> 22:15.360
which allowed us to sort of search for the best models that would help us find the relationship

22:15.360 --> 22:21.440
between the metabolism state and the metabolism derivative at each time point.

22:21.440 --> 22:26.520
And yeah, so once we get, once we extract one of those models, then we use that to do

22:26.520 --> 22:28.440
downstream processing.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.400
The downstream processing in this case is what?

22:31.400 --> 22:32.400
Okay.

22:32.400 --> 22:37.320
So as soon as we have that relationship, the model itself, you can think of that as the

22:37.320 --> 22:40.000
hill from before.

22:40.000 --> 22:46.520
So we have, so that model tells us in the context of the hill, if we find a good model,

22:46.520 --> 22:49.120
we feed it a bunch of time series and then we get a model.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.440
That model represents our hill.

22:50.440 --> 22:55.960
So at any time point, or at any point we put the ball down on, we will know exactly where

22:55.960 --> 22:57.600
it moves at the next point.

22:57.600 --> 23:02.800
And what we want to actually extract from these models are entirely new time series.

23:02.800 --> 23:09.200
So what we do is we take that model and we integrate it over time and allow us to get

23:09.200 --> 23:10.400
trajectories.

23:10.400 --> 23:16.280
So we can put the ball down at the top of the hill and then essentially use a numerical

23:16.280 --> 23:20.960
integration technique to let us understand the trajectory of that ball as it rolls down

23:20.960 --> 23:22.200
the hill.

23:22.200 --> 23:28.680
And how does that ultimately tie in to allowing you to kind of manufacture these compounds

23:28.680 --> 23:30.600
more efficiently?

23:30.600 --> 23:31.600
Yeah.

23:31.600 --> 23:36.120
So once we have a model that tells us how the organism state evolves over time, then

23:36.120 --> 23:41.600
what this does is addresses one of the key challenges that we have in synthetic biology,

23:41.600 --> 23:46.240
which is every time you want to make any data, the reason why our data sets are so small

23:46.240 --> 23:50.760
is that we can actually make lots of features, so that's not too bad.

23:50.760 --> 23:57.060
Every time we build a particular strain that makes a particular molecule, it can take

23:57.060 --> 24:02.840
maybe two, three, six months to get that strain to work, depending on what we're trying

24:02.840 --> 24:03.840
to do.

24:03.840 --> 24:07.680
And once we have that strain working, we can actually extract many, many features from

24:07.680 --> 24:08.680
it.

24:08.680 --> 24:13.560
But using this model, what we're actually able to do is take relatively few strains, which

24:13.560 --> 24:17.960
again are very time-consuming and difficult to make, often very expensive as well.

24:17.960 --> 24:23.320
And then use that to build an in silico model, where we can then do a bunch of experiments

24:23.320 --> 24:27.480
where we vary a lot of parameters to try to find the best strain to make next.

24:27.480 --> 24:32.120
And so oftentimes what we're doing is just trying to minimize the amount of things we

24:32.120 --> 24:35.480
actually have to build because it is so expensive.

24:35.480 --> 24:42.520
When you're trying to vary the proportions of these strains and kind of come up with a

24:42.520 --> 24:50.560
next set of things to test, have you applied a machine learning to that particular part

24:50.560 --> 24:55.440
of the problem, or is that more traditional simulation and things like that?

24:55.440 --> 24:59.400
Well, traditionally, actually, this is something that we're working on now.

24:59.400 --> 25:04.720
We have a paper in preparation to kind of handle this issue, absolutely.

25:04.720 --> 25:12.120
So oftentimes what's traditionally done is that biologists who make the strains themselves

25:12.120 --> 25:15.920
will basically, they'll make their strains and they'll test them out, and then they'll

25:15.920 --> 25:19.840
use intuition or knowledge from the literature to make those decisions.

25:19.840 --> 25:23.160
But once you have a lot of variables, you have a lot of, let's say, a lot of proteins

25:23.160 --> 25:26.800
that you need to change at once, their intuition often breaks down.

25:26.800 --> 25:32.960
And so absolutely, we're applying various kinds of methods to making predictions on how

25:32.960 --> 25:34.520
to change the strain next.

25:34.520 --> 25:41.160
And that's sort of an extension to this method that we describe in the paper.

25:41.160 --> 25:47.920
If we use a Bayesian optimization-like approaches to handle that, along with some Monte Carlo

25:47.920 --> 25:49.320
sampling type approaches.

25:49.320 --> 25:55.720
So yeah, that work is forthcoming, and hopefully soon we'll be out in the world, so.

25:55.720 --> 25:56.720
Cool.

25:56.720 --> 26:00.640
How does the Monte Carlo sampling apply here?

26:00.640 --> 26:05.120
Oh, I'm not sure I can give this stuff away just yet, but I'd be happy with it.

26:05.120 --> 26:06.120
It's pre-pub.

26:06.120 --> 26:07.120
Yeah, it's pre-pub.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.120
Got it.

26:08.120 --> 26:13.640
So yeah, I'd love to share, I really would, but as soon as it's out, I'll definitely share

26:13.640 --> 26:14.640
with everybody.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.520
Sure enough, fair enough.

26:16.520 --> 26:18.720
You know, this conversation is interesting.

26:18.720 --> 26:27.520
It reminds me of an interview that I did recently that hasn't been posted yet with our researcher

26:27.520 --> 26:38.480
named Nathan Kuts out of the University of Washington, who is trying to also apply control

26:38.480 --> 26:48.400
systems theory and time series data in his case to the problem of tuning lasers and also

26:48.400 --> 26:55.920
building models that describe neurological pathways and simple organisms.

26:55.920 --> 27:00.400
And the thing that he did that is kind of potentially interesting to you, like he's

27:00.400 --> 27:05.160
also trying to find the shape of the hill, right?

27:05.160 --> 27:11.800
Like in your case, you know, these things are traditionally models with explicit equations

27:11.800 --> 27:19.200
and differentiated and all that kind of stuff, and so he created this model that is the

27:19.200 --> 27:25.240
model is a linear combination of all different kinds of features that you might expect to

27:25.240 --> 27:28.080
be in one of the physics equations.

27:28.080 --> 27:36.240
You know, so exponentials and squares and qubits and all these, all these like higher order

27:36.240 --> 27:43.120
types of factors and then use some relatively simple, you know, linear regression types

27:43.120 --> 27:53.240
of techniques to fit a model to the time series data and ultimately use that to determine

27:53.240 --> 27:58.200
like the empirical equations that govern these relationships for the problems that he's

27:58.200 --> 28:05.400
trying to solve, which sounds kind of interesting, you know, I said that mostly to kind of

28:05.400 --> 28:12.800
challenge myself to explain what he described to me, but also because it sounds like an

28:12.800 --> 28:17.200
interesting kind of parallel approach to solving this ultimate problem that you're trying

28:17.200 --> 28:18.200
to solve.

28:18.200 --> 28:23.320
Yeah, I mean, I think it's one of these things where you take down deep enough in enough

28:23.320 --> 28:27.160
fields and there's fundamentally shared challenges.

28:27.160 --> 28:31.120
And I think definitely one of the big ones right now, one of the things I see cropping

28:31.120 --> 28:35.840
up in different fields is this issue of how do you understand dynamic behavior just from

28:35.840 --> 28:40.840
data and anybody who's doing that in a different context is certainly really interesting to

28:40.840 --> 28:41.840
me.

28:41.840 --> 28:47.520
You've got this, these systems, like can you talk at all about what the impact of this

28:47.520 --> 28:52.760
work has been or what kind of results you've seen or like, how is this fundamentally

28:52.760 --> 28:55.360
changed this work for you?

28:55.360 --> 29:02.240
Yeah, so we're moving forward now from the paper and we're trying to basically go from

29:02.240 --> 29:07.720
the smaller data sets that have been collected and motivate bigger data collections so that

29:07.720 --> 29:11.680
we can see what happens once we actually get into the realm where we can start using

29:11.680 --> 29:13.840
more sophisticated models.

29:13.840 --> 29:19.040
And so I mean, so far it's relatively new so there's, we've gotten a lot of interest

29:19.040 --> 29:23.160
from other researchers and trying to use this for other applications.

29:23.160 --> 29:29.840
People have been interested in the microbiome, that's one of the big things that people

29:29.840 --> 29:35.400
are interested in right now, figuring out how this interplay between all these different

29:35.400 --> 29:40.120
microbes actually plays out because right now there's a real challenge with predactivity

29:40.120 --> 29:41.120
in that arena.

29:41.120 --> 29:48.680
So I think the impact going forward is likely to be providing predactivity where before

29:48.680 --> 29:53.440
a lack of experimental knowledge or a lack of scientific knowledge would have limited

29:53.440 --> 29:56.400
us for making good models.

29:56.400 --> 30:01.880
And ultimately, I want to live in a world where more data in some sense equals greater

30:01.880 --> 30:03.720
predactivity and more knowledge.

30:03.720 --> 30:06.920
But right now, those things aren't actually all that coupled.

30:06.920 --> 30:11.920
Are you personally involved in some of these applications to adjacent areas or is this

30:11.920 --> 30:17.840
just things that you're seeing in the community kind of grow out of some of your work?

30:17.840 --> 30:19.640
Those things will just be starting for us.

30:19.640 --> 30:22.720
So we're definitely reaching out and looking for collaborations.

30:22.720 --> 30:27.240
That's definitely a big thing that, you know, is, is for us.

30:27.240 --> 30:31.920
And yeah, I mean, definitely, we're, and you know, there's, there's other things

30:31.920 --> 30:40.320
ongoing recently we've, we've acquired a new robot here at, at a J Bay in order to actually

30:40.320 --> 30:45.600
start producing the kind of data we really want in order to rigorously evaluate this

30:45.600 --> 30:50.960
for bigger data sets and see if we can really learn substantial things that will let us

30:50.960 --> 30:55.480
solve the major challenges of metabolic engineering and do this effectively, effectively

30:55.480 --> 31:00.360
increase the titers without so much failure in our guessing, yeah.

31:00.360 --> 31:06.240
But one of the questions that I did have was you mentioned that the kind of cycle time

31:06.240 --> 31:12.640
of setting up an experiment or, or creating one of these organisms is, you know, on the

31:12.640 --> 31:15.960
order of months to the, to six months to kind of get it right.

31:15.960 --> 31:17.840
What all happens in that two to six months?

31:17.840 --> 31:18.840
Oh, yeah.

31:18.840 --> 31:23.680
So this is, this is the, the messy and interesting world of the lab.

31:23.680 --> 31:29.160
So, you know, if, if we, we start out with essentially an idea, which is, all right, here's

31:29.160 --> 31:31.520
the pro, we're trying to make substance acts.

31:31.520 --> 31:35.320
Let's go back to, you know, Lymanine say, maybe even we could, we could do a different,

31:35.320 --> 31:36.320
let's say, Pynine.

31:36.320 --> 31:41.880
Pynine can, is, is a substance you can find in, in pine nuts and it also, you can use it

31:41.880 --> 31:43.800
as a jet fuel, it turns out.

31:43.800 --> 31:48.240
And so, you know, the reaches, researchers, researchers say they want to create, create

31:48.240 --> 31:49.880
Pynine using one of their strains.

31:49.880 --> 31:54.640
And so first they go into the literature and they look for all the, the proteins they're

31:54.640 --> 31:57.200
going to need to put into the organism.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.280
And so first you need to get those synthesized.

31:59.280 --> 32:03.280
You have to go send those off to a company who makes that DNA.

32:03.280 --> 32:06.040
They go ahead and they, they make all that DNA, they send it to us.

32:06.040 --> 32:10.640
And then, then the next step is the researchers have to test out each one of those proteins

32:10.640 --> 32:15.000
to make sure they work because we're taking it from some other organism and putting it into

32:15.000 --> 32:16.000
a new context.

32:16.000 --> 32:21.120
It's like, if you went to some, you know, semiconductor factory and you used a machine that was

32:21.120 --> 32:25.240
kind of similar to what you needed and say like a textile factory, you have to bring

32:25.240 --> 32:27.840
it back and make sure it's still working in that context.

32:27.840 --> 32:32.240
And so they go through the process of validating all these different enzymes, making sure they

32:32.240 --> 32:33.400
work.

32:33.400 --> 32:37.440
And then you have to put them all together into a single piece of DNA and put them in.

32:37.440 --> 32:41.160
And depending on the organism, this can be a time-consuming process.

32:41.160 --> 32:44.920
So first you have to put it all together and that can take, you know, a few days to

32:44.920 --> 32:46.160
a week to do that.

32:46.160 --> 32:50.680
If it works, if it doesn't, you have to go through a set of troubleshooting steps.

32:50.680 --> 32:55.080
And then, you know, let's say you actually get it all assembled and you put it in, you

32:55.080 --> 32:59.480
know, maybe it does certain parts of it don't express well enough.

32:59.480 --> 33:02.440
Maybe, you know, there's a lot of issues that can go wrong.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.200
So that can take a period of time as well.

33:04.200 --> 33:08.240
And then once you get past that point of putting it all in, you have a strain and then you

33:08.240 --> 33:09.240
can test that strain.

33:09.240 --> 33:13.440
So all of these things, you know, there's like for almost all those steps, there's like,

33:13.440 --> 33:19.120
you know, weeks to months, depending on how much difficulty you encounter.

33:19.120 --> 33:22.960
And then you put it all together and you hope it does what you want it to do.

33:22.960 --> 33:23.960
So.

33:23.960 --> 33:28.680
And I've got to imagine that in the kind of scenarios you're describing, the data that

33:28.680 --> 33:38.000
you're collecting can be fairly noisy, fairly messy, which I think would compound or be

33:38.000 --> 33:41.760
compounded by the fact that you're not collecting a ton of it.

33:41.760 --> 33:47.360
Are there things that you've had to do in your pipelines or modeling processes that you've

33:47.360 --> 33:50.080
had to do specifically because of those issues?

33:50.080 --> 33:51.080
Yeah.

33:51.080 --> 33:52.760
We're definitely very aware of it.

33:52.760 --> 33:55.360
There's a limited amount we can actually do about it right now.

33:55.360 --> 33:58.800
I mean, really it's going towards future challenges.

33:58.800 --> 34:05.760
Usually all these experiments, kind of the field standard, which, you know, may have to

34:05.760 --> 34:08.040
change is you do everything in triplicate.

34:08.040 --> 34:12.080
So if you do an experiment, you do three copies of the same experiment.

34:12.080 --> 34:17.040
And then you can use that triplicate data to sort of narrow down where you expect it

34:17.040 --> 34:18.040
actually to show up.

34:18.040 --> 34:23.480
And so you can get, you know, tighter bounds on the error for each one of your measurements.

34:23.480 --> 34:29.040
But oftentimes even after you do that, even after you take into account, you know, all of

34:29.040 --> 34:33.960
the variation, you still can have really substantial variation in your data.

34:33.960 --> 34:38.680
And part of that is just because it's a messy process, you know, you have human beings doing

34:38.680 --> 34:42.480
the sampling and human beings have to be, you know, their lives are taken into account.

34:42.480 --> 34:46.960
So for example, the data set we're working with was collected by two postdocs.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.440
Over 72 hours.

34:48.440 --> 34:53.400
They literally were sitting beside the fermenter and every two to four hours.

34:53.400 --> 34:56.640
They had to go collect their samples, prep them and deal with them.

34:56.640 --> 35:00.400
And so like, you know, they took turns like sleeping so that they could do this.

35:00.400 --> 35:04.280
And that's part of the reason why we don't have a lot of data sets like that.

35:04.280 --> 35:07.840
Not to mention, you know, it's lack of sleep and then maybe you miss it by 20 minutes

35:07.840 --> 35:08.840
on the measurement.

35:08.840 --> 35:12.240
You know, if you've got a time, a variation in your time measurement by plus or minus

35:12.240 --> 35:15.120
20 minutes, you know, that, that of course can introduce error.

35:15.120 --> 35:16.840
And there's just little things like that.

35:16.840 --> 35:21.560
So, you know, one of the things we're hoping is that as we move towards more robotic solutions,

35:21.560 --> 35:26.440
we can sort of key in on all the components of the error and tighten it up much more.

35:26.440 --> 35:29.800
And there's definitely, you know, there's definitely industrial players in the field who

35:29.800 --> 35:32.520
are, who are doing this kind of thing as well.

35:32.520 --> 35:33.520
Awesome.

35:33.520 --> 35:38.520
Any advice or pointers for folks that are interested in this area and want to learn

35:38.520 --> 35:40.320
more about what's happening in it?

35:40.320 --> 35:41.320
Oh, yeah.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.880
So pretty much now it's become very accessible.

35:44.880 --> 35:50.120
If you're interested in biotechnology, there are a lot, at least in San Francisco, there

35:50.120 --> 35:54.880
are a lot of sort of places where you can learn this, these sort of biohacker spaces.

35:54.880 --> 35:57.040
So if you're interested, it's out there.

35:57.040 --> 36:03.160
You can go and visit one of these things, look up your local biohacker space and you can

36:03.160 --> 36:06.160
go out and figure out, you know, what's going on.

36:06.160 --> 36:09.760
You can, you can do CRISPR, you know, it's, it's at the end of the day, it's very much

36:09.760 --> 36:11.000
like cooking.

36:11.000 --> 36:16.200
And if you know how to follow a recipe, you can learn how to do synthetic biology.

36:16.200 --> 36:23.440
So then, I had no idea that CRISPR was that accessible, like what is, what's an example

36:23.440 --> 36:29.760
of something that someone could do, you know, with CRISPR, just accessing a machine at

36:29.760 --> 36:31.840
one of these biohacker spaces?

36:31.840 --> 36:32.840
Yeah.

36:32.840 --> 36:36.520
So CRISPR, you know, just like all the things we were talking about today, it's a protein.

36:36.520 --> 36:39.120
And so it's defined by a piece of genetic code.

36:39.120 --> 36:44.600
And so all you need to do is make these genetic constructs and you can use it.

36:44.600 --> 36:48.440
In our case, you know, typically in biohacker spaces, you're not going to be dealing with

36:48.440 --> 36:50.120
human cells.

36:50.120 --> 36:51.960
That's a little bit more challenging.

36:51.960 --> 36:56.440
There's issues with biosafety and things like that and getting approval.

36:56.440 --> 36:57.520
So that'll be a little harder.

36:57.520 --> 37:03.520
But if you want to work with plants or you want to work with, you want to work with microorganisms,

37:03.520 --> 37:05.480
that's totally doable.

37:05.480 --> 37:11.040
And so really at the end of the day, all you have is essentially a construct, just a piece

37:11.040 --> 37:15.840
of DNA that you put into your cells and it will express CRISPR, which is, you know, these

37:15.840 --> 37:20.760
genetic scissors that will allow you to essentially make cuts in the genome where you want that

37:20.760 --> 37:22.960
are targeted by these guides.

37:22.960 --> 37:26.440
And yeah, it's actually very accessible, you know, it's really at the end of the day,

37:26.440 --> 37:30.440
you're transferring liquids from one thing to another and then if you do this in the right

37:30.440 --> 37:34.320
order and you design your experiment right, you get, you know, the genetic modifications

37:34.320 --> 37:37.200
you want and you can verify them in the lab pretty easily.

37:37.200 --> 37:43.600
What would be in the book of 10 weekend projects to do at a biohacker space?

37:43.600 --> 37:48.480
Oh, so this is actually, when I was first getting into it, I had very little syn bio experience.

37:48.480 --> 37:51.400
So I visited some of these.

37:51.400 --> 37:56.360
I think I guess shout out to bio curious, which is one of the ones in the day that was very

37:56.360 --> 37:59.200
accessible, very friendly people.

37:59.200 --> 38:06.600
At first, like the first thing you do in biology typically is you make things glow.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.400
It turns out.

38:09.400 --> 38:12.960
And you probably don't need CRISPR for this, but this might be one of the first things

38:12.960 --> 38:20.000
you do is you sort of put these, you put in a piece of DNA that expresses a glowing protein

38:20.000 --> 38:24.640
on this thing called GFP that comes from jellyfish and then you put these things under a light

38:24.640 --> 38:25.840
and you can see them glow.

38:25.840 --> 38:28.240
And so that, that way you can see the work you want done.

38:28.240 --> 38:31.880
But in terms of like the cool projects they were doing, I'm not really up to date on what

38:31.880 --> 38:40.520
everybody's doing now, but at the time they were working on making animal-free milk products

38:40.520 --> 38:45.360
and things like that or animal-free cheese, I think, vegan cheese and by expressing a protein

38:45.360 --> 38:46.840
called casin.

38:46.840 --> 38:52.040
And I'm not sure which genetic tools they were using, but almost certainly you can find

38:52.040 --> 38:55.960
a way to use, like if you want to get some experience with CRISPR, you can do it at one

38:55.960 --> 38:56.960
of those places.

38:56.960 --> 38:57.960
Wow.

38:57.960 --> 38:58.960
Yeah.

38:58.960 --> 38:59.960
It's really accessible.

38:59.960 --> 39:00.960
High school kids are doing it these days.

39:00.960 --> 39:01.960
Yeah.

39:01.960 --> 39:04.160
Well, Zach, thanks so much for taking the time to chat with me.

39:04.160 --> 39:08.200
I learned a ton and I appreciate your explanations and analogies.
