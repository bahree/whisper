00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,080
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,440
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,360
How many of you remember my conversation with Josh Bloom from Twimble Talk No. 5?

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:35,560
Josh is the founder and CTO of startup wise.io, which sought to apply AI to the challenge

6
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,040
of providing customer support.

7
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:46,160
In Josh's words, what we do in our company at wise.io is help customer support agents

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,760
become more efficient at their work by suggesting answers of how they can respond to an incoming

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:02,960
increase by automatically triaging incoming increase or tickets, emails, etc. that is getting

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,400
them to the right person or the right group who's going to be the best at answering that

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
question.

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,800
And then in some cases, we will automatically respond to incoming increase.

13
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:18,480
So when you write into e-commerce site and say, my package didn't arrive, there's

14
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:25,200
a growing chance that us or somebody else may be answering what looks like a bespoke question

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,960
of yours with a what looks like a bespoke answer.

16
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,920
Josh shared a ton of insight into how to build AI-powered products in that show, including

17
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,360
gems like this one.

18
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,120
Yeah, so there's definitely this separation of concerns, which again is both an organizational

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:49,800
one and then is also a computational one, to the level where we think we often talk about

20
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:56,320
what we call the organizational API of who within this stack is the customer of who.

21
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,680
And so for instance, the people who are the sort of core ML and algorithms folks in the

22
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,920
company are working in C++ and surfacing the great results back into Python layer.

23
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,360
Their customer is the data science team.

24
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,280
The customer of the data science team is the people working on our architecture who have

25
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,680
to maintain this scalable robust infrastructure.

26
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,840
And their customers are the people working in the middleware and their customers are the

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,680
ones who are in the UI.

28
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,920
And so each of them have a set of contracts of what it is that each part of that stack

29
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,280
is looking for and how, in fact, they're supposed to engage with each other.

30
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,480
Having the data science team be able to push stuff into production without having to be

31
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,400
on the upside of things, nor have to think about the architecture has really freed us

32
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,360
up in great ways, I think, to innovate.

33
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,680
Since my conversation with Josh, he's sold wise.io to GE.

34
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,400
And now he's working to quote unquote AI all the things at that massive company.

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,360
So why the trip down memory lane?

36
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,920
Well it's because Josh is just one of the many great speakers who will be joining me

37
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,240
at the future of data summit May 15th and 16th at the Interop ITX conference in Las Vegas.

38
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,440
Josh will be there to elaborate on his experience building AI products and platforms in what

39
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,360
will surely be an amazing presentation.

40
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,040
A few other speakers I've recently added to the agenda include Zachary Heneath, who's

41
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,840
part of a SWAT team of sorts at Capital One that helps various parts of the business

42
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,440
incorporate machine learning and AI into their projects.

43
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,160
Shree Cannon Ramashandran, who will be joining us to talk about marketing in the age of AI

44
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,560
and how her team uses machine learning to drive top line growth at telecom giant level

45
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,440
three communications.

46
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,280
Shree is a big fan of the podcast and I'm really looking forward to her talk.

47
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,560
In Jennifer Prinky, who leads data science and data strategy teams at Walmart Labs, she'll

48
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,840
be speaking on the challenges of integrating data from multiple silos to support machine

49
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,160
learning and AI applications for multi channel retail.

50
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,400
And after their presentations, I'll be leading a Q&A and panel discussion with the three

51
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,480
of them on bringing AI to the enterprise.

52
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,880
This will be the time to get your questions answered.

53
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,280

Okay, now let's get to today's show.

60
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:56,320
Today we bring you the second of three interviews we did backstage from the NYU Future Labs

61
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,840
AI summit.

62
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,440
This time with Rouchier Puri.

63
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,280
Rouchier is an IBM fellow and the chief architect at IBM Watson.

64
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,600
I caught up with Rouchier after his talk on engineering the future of AI for business.

65
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,400
Our conversation focused on cognition and reasoning and we explored what these concepts represent,

66
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,240
how enterprises really want to consume them and how IBM Watson seeks to deliver them.

67
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,240
Enjoy the show.

68
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:38,560
All right, everyone, so I'm here with Rouchier Puri, an IBM fellow and chief architect with

69
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,560
IBM Watson.

70
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,880
Rouchier just came off from giving his presentation here at the Future Labs AI summit.

71
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:46,880
Welcome, Rouchier.

72
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,880
Thank you.

73
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,280
Why don't we start with you giving us a little bit of a little bit of a view into your

74
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,480
background?

75
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:03,400
So I was background pretty much, I started at the level of all the way down to circuits

76
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:12,360
and physics and over time I've been just traveling that staircase in terms of abstraction

77
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:22,960
levels, going up that abstraction level and I'm traveled from circuits to systems to

78
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:33,400
algorithms in software to cloud to AI for last five years or so and all along I've worked

79
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:39,640
on algorithms for all kinds of applications including algorithm for designing chips to

80
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:46,440
algorithm for designing systems to making them smarter to now algorithms for Watson and

81
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,440
my job is to make Watson less shiny more real.

82
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Nice, nice.

83
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,200
How does it give you a unique perspective because in many ways it seems like AI is starting

84
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:00,280
at that top level of abstraction and then working its way down to the chip level?

85
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,240
Yeah, so that's a very interesting point and I think I would consider myself lucky

86
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:15,920
to be able to gather the experience I have gathered over past two and a half decades

87
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:23,200
or so I would say where I started actually down and traveled up where interestingly the

88
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:30,040
details at the bottom are quite overwhelming and as you move up you are abstracting things

89
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:36,680
and as you move down people many people shy away from those details so yes it does give

90
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:44,960
you a unique perspective into a common systems and a software and a cloud view into this

91
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,840
exactly and by systems I just don't mean you know a board or a chip I really mean system

92
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,760
in its entirety which is a you know living, breathing cloud so that's great.

93
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:00,200
So why don't you tell us a little bit about the presentation you just gave for those

94
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,400
who weren't able to attend what'd you talk about?

95
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:11,720
So I gave a talk on engineering the future of AI and I basically took the folks through

96
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:19,800
a journey which is you know what is the what is the art of possible and and if you really

97
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:28,120
do it right where are we today and I differentiated you know the coolness of AI to what problems

98
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,400
we really need to solve where you know the enterprises are struggling where lot of problems

99
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,680
need to be solved it's not just about finding cats and dogs it's really about you know

100
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:46,280
finding you know I have a tax problem you know go solve it for me that's popular to beat

101
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,960
up on tax cats and dogs nowadays yeah so you know that's so I took and then I really

102
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,160
talked about you know where the fallacies of some of the current techniques may be and

103
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:04,840
where we really need to go okay so what in your perspective is are some of those real enterprise

104
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,880
problems what are folks really trying to accomplish with this technology I think folks in the

105
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:19,480
enterprise first of all they really are trying to solve problems of large data in terms of

106
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:26,520
you know I've got massive number of documents varying formats of documents varying modalities

107
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:32,000
of data as well I could have audio data I could have video data I could have data available

108
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,440
in all kind of different formats from PDFs to to docs to everything else actually that's

109
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:45,480
available including you know scan jpeg images of you know documents and other things I may

110
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:52,640
be scanning go address it for me and then to be able to have what I call conversational

111
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:59,160
discovery I call that whole domain what what I would say conversational discovery which

112
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,960
means what don't just discover things for me and I talked about this in the in the presentation

113
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:11,640
I just gave as well cognition is not just about I ask you a question and then you give me

114
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,680
an answer if you knew the answer you give me an answer that's called search actually cognition

115
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,840
is more about I ask you a question you actually come back and say oh I figured out five

116
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:27,640
pieces of that puzzle I don't know five pieces of the puzzle that I really need to answer

117
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,520
that question I'm gonna summarize that in the form of a question back to you and trying

118
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:37,240
to get the answer out of you so that you can guide me this that's really what cognition

119
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:41,600
is about it's not about you know okay how many you know above what limit I need to pay

120
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,200
what tax yeah it's there in the document it's really about you know finding the pieces

121
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,920
of puzzle and posing it back to me in a way and getting a conversation getting me engaged

122
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,040
in a conversation so that you can get the answer back that's what I call so discovery

123
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:03,160
is a is a enterprise application and then conversational discovery make it more consumerized

124
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:11,080
actually so it's really about amalgamation of consumers and enterprises consumer experience

125
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,080
with enterprise problems interesting I like the way you put that conversational discovery

126
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:25,840
I have been talking to people and asking people about what I call intelligence intelligence

127
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,120
design like how do we design experiences in light of artificial intelligence and one

128
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:37,360
thing that strikes me is that it's it needs to be at least very interdisciplinary and so

129
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,760
when you talk about conversational discovery it makes me think that we've accomplished

130
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:50,840
a lot in terms of how do we make information and data discoverable interactively in the

131
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,120
business intelligence world like ad hoc you know query discovery things like that are you

132
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:01,320
are you at IBM or do you see any place people that are working to pull all these threads

133
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:10,480
together to make conversational discovery possible yes so we've got actually a application

134
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:18,160
we've hold a bunch of actually APIs available for developers to go and write their applications

135
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:25,840
against discoveries one of the more fundamental APIs we have available we classify our APIs

136
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,560
into three categories one is conversation based one is discovery based and the third one

137
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,640
is what I call signal actually which is in our speech text all this all this stuff actually

138
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:44,480
and images is part of it as well and yes we see we at Watson have been working very

139
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:53,040
hard towards bringing all these together conversation along with speech along with discovery with

140
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,600
reasoning actually as well so it's not about just you know information retrieval it's not

141
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,680
information retrieval it's about reasoning also which is where conversational discovery with

142
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,760
natural speech becomes very powerful that's exactly what we've been working towards we've got

143
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,960
pieces of it already there out in the marketplace like discoveries there in the marketplace and

144
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,320
other things we are working towards as we bring more and more reasoning techniques into discovery

145
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,720
and conversation on top of it reasoning is a very high level concept how do you make that more

146
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,040
concrete for people what actually are you doing that you classify as reasoning so I'll let me

147
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:38,720
let me give an example of reasoning actually so obviously for for academic folks there are three

148
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,280
kinds of reasoning abductive inductive and you know I'm not going to bore you with that that

149
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:50,720
normal creature but but let's assume for the time being actually that that you're trying to

150
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,400
again I'm gonna go back to the example I gave I've got five pieces of the puzzle figuring out

151
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,280
there are 10 pieces of the puzzle itself is reasoning right you asked me a question figuring out

152
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:09,040
10 pieces of the puzzle itself is reasoning figuring out I've got five of them figured out that's

153
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:17,840
another level of reasoning and then combining the five unknowns into a summarization and posing

154
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:24,800
that question back is actually part of summarization not necessarily reasoning and then when you pose

155
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:32,000
a question back to me going and figuring out that those satisfy that five pieces or not the answer

156
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:39,840
you gave back to me that is reasoning as well actually okay um and then there is obviously you know

157
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:46,240
mathematical reasoning that we can have right as well so uh so as you so you primarily

158
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:55,280
delivering uh Watson via API is presumably this reasoning uh element as well what is the API

159
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:00,800
look like you not just have some corpus of data and say okay go reason and tell me back things

160
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,760
here are you directing it what is what's the yeah so reasoning is really built as as part of many

161
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:15,200
of the API internally itself um so for example you know discovery and and and knowledge graph as we

162
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:22,000
move forward and uh querying on knowledge graphs and reasoning on knowledge graphs as well

163
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,960
is delivered as as part of the capability of discovery okay it's not that we are exposing reasoning

164
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:35,600
in its abstract form it's integrated as part of the API is that we are delivering uh specifically

165
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,600
in discoveries specifically in things like uh compare and comply I showed examples of obligations

166
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,720
and controls uh that's reasoning itself as well um figuring out what are my obligations may not be

167
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:55,280
uh be be reasoning however figuring out what obligations and what what controls map with each other

168
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,840
is actually certainly form of reasoning as well so these are all integrated together and we are

169
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:06,320
bringing it out as you know very consumable APIs which underneath actually use many reasoning techniques

170
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:13,920
as we move forward okay and do you think uh reasoning as a service is a is a worthwhile goal is

171
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:21,200
that separate and distinct in your mind from uh AGI uh as it may be an intermediate step even or

172
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:28,560
is that not really the the direction you're headed so so at least in terms of so certainly

173
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:35,280
and I'm gonna take just a step back just for a minute and and and and we we are working towards

174
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:41,120
bringing out learning as a service actually so whether it is deep learning on machine learning

175
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:47,200
Watson machine learning is already available actually on our on our APIs so learning as a service

176
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:53,680
and it's it's certainly I mean I could argue it's certainly we are watching the consumer behavior

177
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:02,400
very very closely actually however um it really will depend on it's hard for me to see right now

178
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,360
whether somebody will consume reasoning in abstraction uh-huh it's very hard to figure out actually

179
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,680
and it's it's really hard for me to pinpoint that if that is what will that be reason in abstraction

180
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:19,600
so I would say currently know however you know this area is evolving very fast and we are keeping

181
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:26,000
our mind open with respect to if something's emerged um people they you know people are actually

182
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
obviously we are working on uh uh data science uh workbench as well that we are exposing

183
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,120
and part of those algorithms we can expose reasoning algorithms we can expose to so obviously

184
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,040
for data scientists we can have capabilities which get exposed directly in terms of hey I want

185
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:49,200
that reasoning algorithm and that reasoning algorithm but to me other than for for you know PhDs

186
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,920
in this area it's hard for me to see how consumers actually and by consumers I really mean enterprise

187
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:02,080
consumers as well how they just abstractly consume reasoning but again it's a fast moving area so

188
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:12,960
so if you were to to um lay out you know one two three general directions for the machine learning

189
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,240
as a service API's you know where they headed what should we expect to see from those that

190
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:27,440
that you offer as well as the field as a whole so machine learning as a service specifically so

191
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,800
many things that are available in the marketplace today is what I call AMIs actually you know you

192
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,640
can go to Amazon or Google and you can download something and you know you can spin up a VM and go

193
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,240
install it and play to your hearts content however to me where things are really headed is

194
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,880
you bring me your data mm-hmm you don't have to tell me whether you want to choose cafe or

195
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:58,000
tensor flow or you know bring me your data by the way data is good right in this area data is

196
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,080
gold if I gave you my data I gave you my life effectively and I've given you my life already you

197
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,720
guide me regarding don't ask me what neural network you want I don't know the head and tail of

198
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,160
neural network as a consumer neither do I want to know I run my business don't ask me what kind of

199
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,440
neural network would you like you would you like two GPUs or four GPUs is what do I care go go figure

200
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,080
it out and so it really is heading for what I would call machine learning for machine learning

201
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,960
go figure out on top of machine learning a entire layer which is smart enough

202
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,880
which takes data right and then you know figures everything out and gives me that insight back

203
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,760
that's where things are heading don't ask me do you want to use logistic regression or naive

204
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,520
base right do I care really right I'll say huh what did you ask me right that's where things are

205
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,840
heading which is more on AI for AI or machine learning for machine learning because the you

206
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,760
know the lower layer can get complex actually and you should not be exposing that to the to the end

207
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,760
consumers obviously there is you know a narrow percentage of people let's say five percent or so

208
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,600
who are PITs in deep in either deep learning or data science area who do want to actually thinker

209
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,960
with that but majority of the people they really don't want to they want to actually give you the

210
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,680
data and really get insights out of it you need to make it seamless for them you really need

211
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,960
even need to tell them you know I've got GPUs yeah so if it helps them go use it if it doesn't

212
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:37,840
don't use it are you getting any pushback in fact from people who don't want to give you the data

213
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:44,880
actually it's certainly as I as I described we've got three levels of of data sources actually

214
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,280
I would say and where we are enriching that data and deriving insights out of that public domain

215
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,960
private and we seamlessly sort of we were cross that public being I already talked about which is

216
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,240
you know Wikipedia kind of data domain being you are in finance industry or insurance industry

217
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,800
you got knowledge base for that and then private is your data right which we don't share with

218
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:15,680
anybody neither do we share the insights of that with anybody as well and as we explain in fact

219
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:24,000
one of our strengths at IBM Watson is really are are specifically this clarity on data

220
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,920
we will not use your data specifically to go and benefit others your data your data you hold the

221
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:36,720
insights for that and and our CEO and and David Kenny who's the the senior VP of Watson has been

222
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:43,520
very explicit in saying this I would say one of our our differentiators actually at Watson

223
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:50,400
is specifically the clarity of the data policy okay and specifically the we weven get cross

224
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:57,040
this seamlessly with Watson okay great so the wrap things up do you have maybe three takeaways

225
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,520
from your presentation that you would like to lead folks with or was were there were there any

226
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:11,680
calls to action that you laid out so I would really say you know first of all these are really

227
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:19,120
interesting times the AI has made tremendous progress in in last you know decade or so more

228
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:26,480
recently in the last five years and and businesses are hungry for how to really consume this this

229
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:33,680
wave of of breakthroughs that we've been actually getting the the problem is really not about

230
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,800
obviously being able to search but be able to reason over the data as well build models and

231
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:48,400
make it easy to consume actually and to get to the next level of cognition which I call actually

232
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:54,880
conversational discovery with with reasoning or interaction with insight there many names of it

233
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,320
but really I think from it it's it's very interesting times for business businesses because

234
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:08,160
at the lower layers the complexity is quite large you need to be able to to abstract that complexity

235
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:14,320
from the users and be able to give them insights with they are giving you the data and and that's

236
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,120
all they need to give you you should actually you know really insulate this from them and be able

237
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,760
to give them the the benefit of of conversational discovery as we move forward so great well great
