All right, everyone.

19
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,960
I am on the line with Brian Burke.

20
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,320
Brian is a senior analytics specialist at ESPN.

21
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,920
Brian, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

22
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Hi, Sam.

23
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,520
Thanks for having me.

24
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,600
Just as we started, you mentioned that you've been listening to the show for a couple of

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,440
years.

26
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,200
That being the case, you know that we speak to a lot of folks with really varied backgrounds

27
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,040
on the show, but I think this may be the first time that we've ever talked to someone

28
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,960
who started their career as a jet pilot, or at least no one's mentioned it thus far.

29
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,960
How did you get from being a jet pilot to working in deep learning?

30
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,240
I'd love to hear the story.

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,560
Yeah, sure.

32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:38,760
I left the Navy in around 2005 and did some work in the defense industry.

33
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:44,960
After flying jets in the Navy off of carriers, what I was doing was pretty boring.

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,320
I had a lot of spare, you know, megahertz left over at the end of the day.

35
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,720
And I was a big football fan.

36
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,720
I noticed that the kind of the level of statistical analysis and common in the media was pretty

37
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:00,720
lacking.

38
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,920
I was pretty frustrated with it.

39
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,760
I was like, the Navy had earlier had sent me to graduate school and put me through a program

40
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,720
that was heavy in statistics.

41
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,520
I had never used any of those in my career in the Navy, but once I left, I said, why don't

42
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:21,200
we use some of the stuff that the military uses to win battles and wins wars to help

43
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,960
win football games?

44
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,880
And that was pretty ignorant of the money ball revolution and Sabre metrics and Bill

45
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,880
James.

46
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,120
I was completely unaware of that stuff.

47
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,680
So it was kind of, but that was a big advantage because a lot of the baseball people were

48
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,600
looking at football research and they were trying to use that same cookie cutter on football

49
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
and just didn't work.

50
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,200
It's a very different kind of sport.

51
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,520
I kind of had this military background that was more appropriate way of looking at it.

52
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,080
It was kind of two players, zero sum game theory approach.

53
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,680
And you know, kind of like we say in a dogfight, like, you know, it's a it's a knife fight

54
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,680
in a phone booth.

55
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,720
You know, one guy's not going home that day.

56
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,120
So that's kind of like that's kind of like a football game.

57
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,920
That's football is probably the most, you know, martial sport there is.

58
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,320
So that's what the motivation was.

59
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,600
So I had some software left over from, you know, the trial period had ended from grad school

60
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,760
and I was having a debate.

61
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:22,840
I remember with a coworker of mine and we were talking about this defense win championships.

62
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,640
And we were just going around in circles, just like most water cooler conversations like

63
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
that.

64
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,440
And I said, wait a minute, we can answer this.

65
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,280
Let's just download the stats.

66
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,400
I've got the software left in where we'll run over aggression.

67
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,000
We'll have an answer by the end of lunch.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,120
And I just I love that.

69
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,080
Yeah, I just got hooked.

70
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,280
And I was like, we can do more.

71
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,600
Oh, we can predict games with this.

72
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,520
We can do all these sorts of things.

73
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,040
And so I really got in on the ground floor of football analytics and a lot of the core

74
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:57,040
models that are that are in use today throughout the league, you know, that the teams use

75
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,320
themselves, I was I was the developer of things like that.

76
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,200
So expected points, win probability model, some of the core metrics that all came out

77
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,120
of that period.

78
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,000
So a few years later, did you, you know, is it still as easy as, hey, let's just run

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,400
a quick regression on that?

80
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,160
Or did you learn from from that initial experience that it's there's a lot more to it?

81
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,880
Well, that was that was it.

82
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,280
I mean, it was I was mostly self taught a lot of these modeling approaches.

83
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:38,520
And the world has really changed since 2005, just the explosion of data and tools and

84
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,120
modeling approaches.

85
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,720
And so you have to learn them as bad as quickly as they come out.

86
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,320
And the paper we'll talk about today was no exception.

87
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,280
I had to go learn, teach myself neural networks, just to kind of keep up with the state of

88
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,280
the art.

89
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,160
Yeah, well, let's dive into that.

90
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,720
You wrote a paper called deep QB deep learning with player tracking to quantify quarterback

91
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,080
decision making and performance.

92
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,520
Tell us a little bit about the background of that paper.

93
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:15,040
Well, at ESPN, we got access to player tracking data from the National Football League.

94
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:20,120
So we have up to about four seasons worth of data now.

95
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,360
We had about two and a half at the time into the paper.

96
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,760
It's proprietary data.

97
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,200
There are chips on each shoulder pad of each player and in every game for every play.

98
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:37,840
And so we have a really accurate position, velocity, acceleration, orientation, data at

99
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,640
10 hertz, 10 times per second, it updates.

100
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,240
So and it's almost real time too.

101
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,160
So we had there's an API we can tap into.

102
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
And so when we got access to this data, this was even before the teams had access.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So it was it was a lot.

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,080
It was kind of the first true big data set that we had to wrestle with at ESPN on the

105
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,080
sports side.

106
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,800
How long have those chips been been in the, you know, been available?

107
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,680
I think it's 2016, I think was the first full season that they did it.

108
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,480
Yeah, so I think we have four full seasons now.

109
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,680
And it was, I think the first season was a little bit more of a trial and the data is

110
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,440
a little bit spotty, but 17, 18, 19, they've been improving it.

111
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,400
So, so we got this data, we were like, well, we have to exploit it somehow.

112
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,880
That's, that's getting advantage.

113
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,880
What are we going to do?

114
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,320
We came up with some, some pretty good ideas.

115
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,920
Some things, some of our best things aren't even kind of machine learning.

116
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,400
It's just simple geometry.

117
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,160
So we can analyze blocks, for example, like, before we do that, I'm like, I'm trying

118
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:52,720
to figure out the scale of this data in terms of, you know, number of teams, by number

119
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,960
of games, by number of players, by 10 measurements a second.

120
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,160
Can you help us kind of think through, you know, or get a sense for how much data we're

121
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,600
actually talking about here?

122
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,840
About one game would be about four gigabytes, I guess.

123
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,120
So we can put, you can put one game at a time in your laptop and kind of chew on it.

124
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,120
So that's kind of what I do.

125
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Okay.

126
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,120
Yeah.

127
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,360
So, yeah, to span across games, though, you have to, you have to really digest, you know,

128
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,280
I would say 80% of the effort on this project was just digesting the data and processing

129
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,680
it in a way that was manageable for, for analysis.

130
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:41,440
You mentioned an API, like, are you going and downloading all the data from a giving game

131
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,080
or do you need to, like, collect it in real time or something like that?

132
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,920
No, it doesn't need to be collected in real time, although it could be.

133
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,280
And we have been doing that for some spot analysis.

134
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:56,000
So for money and I football, for example, okay.

135
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,680
But yeah, we will, you can go back and get past games as well.

136
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:09,480
So the system is called Next Gen Stats, that's the NFL's brand for the stats.

137
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:16,280
It's highly proprietary, but as a media partner at the NFL, you know, we negotiated access.

138
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:21,440
And so, yeah, we typically, I think we download a play at a time.

139
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,560
Okay.

140
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:35,560
And is the API or the, does the API allow you to download a specific play or do you have

141
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:41,440
to do, like, play segmentation on your own at the game level to figure out, you know,

142
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,080
when a play starts and when a play stops or do they, like, code that when they're collecting

143
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,080
the data?

144
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,040
No, they code that.

145
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Okay.

146
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,040
They do an excellent job.

147
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,040
I can't give them enough credit.

148
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,880
So the certain events are tagged as well.

149
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,320
So when the snap occurs, when there's, when the huddle breaks, you know, when a tackle

150
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,120
occurs, all these, all these events are tagged.

151
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,840
So we don't have to do a lot of our own kind of tagging.

152
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Okay.

153
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Okay.

154
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Great.

155
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,840
Yeah.

156
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,840
So apologies for interrupting you.

157
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,360
I just, it was kind of curious about the data that you're working with.

158
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:24,080
So you're saying that some of the things that you're working with, you know, don't

159
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,480
even require a machine learning.

160
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,640
You're able to do things just based on the geometry of the, is it the player formations

161
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,120
that you're looking at from a geometry perspective?

162
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,280
But that's one thing you can do, yeah.

163
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:44,160
So for example, one of the keys advantages to the Los Angeles Rams offense last year was

164
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,800
they were doing a couple of things.

165
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:50,800
They would sprint from their huddle straight to the line of scrimmage and snap the ball

166
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,120
real quick.

167
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:57,680
And that wouldn't give defense as times to kind of swap what we call strong and weak sides

168
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,440
and do a lot of last second preparation before the ball snapped.

169
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,400
The other thing they would do is compress their formations, very tight formations, which

170
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:14,360
made it difficult for past coverage players to play man-to-man defense.

171
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,680
So it forced the hand of the defenses.

172
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,960
So just very simple things, we could just measure the time between the huddle break and when

173
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,400
the ball snapped for all the different teams and see which teams stand out and do analysis

174
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,280
like that that doesn't really require any sort of number crunching beyond simple, you

175
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:37,160
know, averages, you know, summary statistics or, you know, the width of form, you know, mean

176
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,760
width of formations for different teams and see how things stand out.

177
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,400
My favorite thing so far has been something that's been a bit of a holy grail on football

178
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,560
for a long time, which is stats for linemen.

179
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:54,480
So so much of football is kind of what we say in the trenches and it's these, these, the

180
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,720
big guys who get no credit, you only hear their name when they mess up but they do so

181
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,840
much of the work to make teams successful.

182
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,840
But there's no real statistic, maybe for defensive past rushers, they're sacks and some other

183
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:14,360
things like that, but they're not very telling, they're not very representative of overall

184
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,960
performance.

185
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:23,360
So what we did was we created a past blocking and past rushing metric that just looked

186
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,960
at the geometry of the player.

187
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:30,000
So I can tell who's blocking who, I can see who's being double teamed, I can see how

188
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,440
long blocks are being held.

189
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:40,520
So part of the problem in football is they're analyzing things the wrong way.

190
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:44,240
You have to look at an offensive line as like a survival system.

191
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,840
So it's like a systems engineering problem.

192
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,680
It's kind of like a chain, right?

193
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:53,360
And the first chain that breaks the weakest link in that chain is the one that really matters.

194
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:59,120
So we look at how long that system can survive and do analysis like that.

195
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,520
And it's no more than, I know if you're very, very close to me and your shoulders are oriented

196
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,920
to me, then you must be trying to block me.

197
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,040
And if I get closer to the quarterback than you are, then I've won that block or you're

198
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,720
holding me either way, it's a win for me.

199
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:21,200
So we can see how long those, those blocks are held and we do align in the sand just

200
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,320
to keep things simple at 2.5 seconds, which is average time to throw, which is kind of

201
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,560
benchmarking the league for how long you have to sustain a block and passing situation.

202
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,920
And it's really taken off.

203
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,400
We published like a first article about it on our website.

204
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:47,480
And that afternoon we had NFL general manager's calling looking for full lists for all the

205
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,960
players in the league.

206
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
Oh, wow.

207
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:56,680
Yeah, one of the things that strikes me hearing your description of this that, you know,

208
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:04,640
is not all that dissimilar from the application of machine learning and the business type

209
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,640
of context.

210
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:12,160
You know, traditional business type of context is you're often needing to, you know, define

211
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,640
the problem, formulate the problem, define the metrics that are important.

212
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,800
And it sounds like, yeah, I would have thought coming into this conversation that, you know,

213
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,280
we pretty well defined the important, you know, metrics in sports.

214
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:30,240
Although, you know, now that I'm saying that, that's, you know, the whole thing with

215
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,120
money ball was that we had all those metrics wrong, right?

216
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,400
And it was really this, you know, get on first base probability that, you know, that hadn't

217
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,720
really been looked at and kind of redefined the game.

218
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,760
We figured out, you know, is there that, you know, one standout metric, kind of money ball

219
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,760
metric and football?

220
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,680
Have you figured that out yet?

221
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,080
Or have you found several of these like the, the blocking example you just gave?

222
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:02,640
Well, the blocking is really just an individual performance metric, which has been football.

223
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:08,920
Baseball is really unique with exception of cricket in that it's really a simple sequential

224
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:13,040
matchup problem between kind of pitcher and batter.

225
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,880
And so you can isolate individual performance very, very easily in baseball.

226
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,600
Football is a parallel system, right?

227
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,640
There's 22 players on the field.

228
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:27,720
There's 21 factorial interaction terms occurring between all the players.

229
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,480
It's extremely chaotic.

230
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,520
So we can't just, you know, run over aggression on certain things and different players

231
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:39,280
have different roles, very specialized roles during plays or very different kinds of

232
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,680
plays.

233
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,960
So that's part of the, part of the distinction between, you know, the saber metrics

234
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,360
guys trying to get into football, they couldn't really do that.

235
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:57,600
The big breakthrough happened, I would say in 2009, and I was, I had just developed a

236
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,200
win probability model and was really the first one that really worked that, that didn't

237
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,320
give you kind of junky, you know, nonsense answers.

238
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,720
And I was wondering what we can do with it.

239
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,080
And so I thought this would be a really good decision analysis tool as far as the fourth

240
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,400
down problem.

241
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,560
So what to do on fourth down was this classic problem in football.

242
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,600
You can punt, you can attempt a field goal or you can try to go for it and keep the ball.

243
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,600
And there were, there was earlier research that said, well, you should be going for it,

244
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,280
so a whole lot more often, stop hunting so frequently.

245
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:37,440
That was a big believer in this research, but coaches would, we're rejecting it because

246
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,080
the model, those models could not handle time and score.

247
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:46,360
So depending on the time and score, you have different kind of risk tolerance.

248
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,320
And that makes a huge difference, especially towards the end of the game.

249
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:56,040
So we kind of went from Newtonian football analytics into relativity, football analytics,

250
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,360
and we could kind of adapt things for time and score.

251
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,840
And once we were able to do that, it basically gave us a general theory of football decision-making.

252
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:10,800
And we could, we could decide what to do on fourth down, no one to go for a two point

253
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:15,480
conversion, when to call a time out, any kind of game-level decision that a coach needs

254
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:18,240
to make, we can analyze it.

255
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:27,040
And so what allowed us to do that is that it was there, it sounds like data-driven models

256
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,320
based on that, but was this machine learning or was this some other kind of technique that

257
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
allowed us to get there?

258
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:42,480
And what was the before, how sophisticated was the use of analytics that, in the theory

259
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,240
that said that we were not passing enough?

260
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:52,720
Yeah, well, there was, there was prior research by an economist named, named Romer, not

261
00:17:52,720 --> 00:18:00,400
the Nobel Laureate, but another one, he looked at using what's called an expected points

262
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:08,840
model, which takes into account kind of field position, and the point value, the net expected

263
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,520
point value of having the ball and having a first down at every single yardline on the

264
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
field.

265
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:23,280
From that, you could deduce, if you assume that the game is a point optimization contest

266
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,800
for an infinite amount of time, then that model would apply.

267
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:34,320
And that assumption of point maximization and infinite time works fairly well through

268
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:39,360
the first three quarters of a game, and when the score is relatively close.

269
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,800
But when a team is trailing by a lot of points, or well ahead by a lot of points, or in

270
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,400
the end game in the fourth quarter, when time is a big factor.

271
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:54,240
So for example, point maximization doesn't work if you, if you're down by one point, with

272
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,880
one second left to play, you're not going to, you don't want to optimize your points,

273
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
that might mean try for a touchdown.

274
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,000
You just want to win the game.

275
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,200
So going from point maximization to win probability maximization was this big jump.

276
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,960
And yes, that was a big machine learning model.

277
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,400
I was pretty new to all this.

278
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,360
R was just kind of coming online.

279
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,560
I used SPSS in grad school.

280
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:24,160
But what I wanted for my purposes didn't really exist.

281
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,040
I wanted to use non-parametric regressions.

282
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:35,800
And so I taught myself, what's they called the Excel Basic Plug-in.

283
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Okay.

284
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:51,920
And I created my own lowest function and use that to build out the models.

285
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:58,120
And the other thing is that football scoring happens in these chunks, like seven points

286
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,920
and three points.

287
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:06,200
And so you can't regress over points that they're discrete chunks.

288
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:13,560
So being ahead by two points is not twice as good as being ahead by one point, for example.

289
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,080
You mentioned wanting to apply a non-parametric regression to this.

290
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,880
Why non-parametric?

291
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Because these curves were, you could use splined regressions.

292
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,640
You could use, it was very non-linear.

293
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:38,120
It was not something that they say quadratics or polynomial type regression lines would

294
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,440
adapt well to.

295
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:46,400
So I wanted something more flexible, especially towards the end game, things get very dynamic.

296
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:55,920
And so these curves, these wind probability curves, basically the thing of a chart of maybe

297
00:20:55,920 --> 00:21:01,840
the y-axis is wind probability, the x-axis is field position, and we're looking at slices

298
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,360
of time and score.

299
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,920
And so basically you get a bunch of curves, and those curves can get pretty dynamic toward

300
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,480
the end game.

301
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,920
And so this was, did you say 2009 that the wind probability model, you came out with that?

302
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:23,280
Yeah, I think I started working on that, and what I was able to do is acquire a big

303
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:31,720
library of play by play data, and that was, it was just this confluence of computing power

304
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,000
and tools and the data that's being available online.

305
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,360
So it was just kind of these things just all happened at the same time, and I just happened

306
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,800
to have the spare time and the interest to tackle that.

307
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:52,960
And yeah, so it was 2009, and I'll never forget, I had a brief 15 minutes of notoriety,

308
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:58,640
the Patriots, and Bill Belichick went for an infamous fourth down, a lateening game against

309
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,840
Peyton Manning's Colts in 2009, was November 2009.

310
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,820
And I was already fairly established, I was writing for the New York Times and doing

311
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,720
analysis for them.

312
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:14,480
And I wrote, I said, everybody thought that Bill Belichick going for it with a lead was

313
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,800
a fourth and two on his own, 36, something like that.

314
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,560
And by the book, you always plan.

315
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
And I wrote an article.

316
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,680
I said, no, actually, it was a good decision to go for it, even though it failed.

317
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,760
And here's why.

318
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,440
And it was just, you know, once you do, once you build the models to apply them, it only

319
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,120
requires a tiny bit of, you know, algebra.

320
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,760
And it's one line of algebra.

321
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,400
And the next thing I knew, Sports Illustrator was calling.

322
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,280
He expanded a big feature on me the next Sunday.

323
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,880
And so it was just by luck that this happened.

324
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,720
And I think that got a lot of attention throughout the league.

325
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,840
And teams started thinking about analytics at that point.

326
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,560
So I think we digress a little bit from deep QB.

327
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:10,800
So you have all this data, well, it was deep QB based on only the shoulder chip data

328
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,880
or there are other sources that you pulled into that model.

329
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,680
Well, we used some of the metadata from the play itself, so down distance, yard line.

330
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:27,880
And we also collect by hand at ESPN, we call it video analysis tracking.

331
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,400
And we have a human person looking at each play in near real time.

332
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:38,840
And they'll say, was this, you know, play action pass or was this a drop?

333
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,320
So it was a good pass.

334
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,640
It landed right in the receiver's hands and you should have caught it, but you just didn't

335
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,640
make the play.

336
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,960
So little things like that was added to the, added to the player tracking data.

337
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,960
Got it, got it.

338
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,760
And I think we skipped past the punch line.

339
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:56,760
What's the key problem that you're trying to solve or answer that you're trying to get

340
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,560
at with deep QB?

341
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,520
Well, I was interested in quarterback decision making.

342
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,440
That's probably the most mysterious yet most important part of football, especially in

343
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,000
the NFL where it's really a passing game and the quarterback is so important.

344
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,200
And that decision making, you can, you can analyze physical skills, right, like running

345
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,000
and jumping and strength and things like that.

346
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,880
But it's really hard to quantify decision making, especially under pressure in a highly

347
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,680
dangerous situation.

348
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,880
So it reminded me of my days as a fighter pilot.

349
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:38,880
I wasn't the athlete that Cam Newton is, but when I strapped an F-18 on my back, you

350
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,480
know, we were all Cam Newton's out there.

351
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:48,480
And we all had to make kind of life and death decisions under, you know, great dress.

352
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,320
And then, you know, under, under uncertainty as well.

353
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,720
And so I saw the parallels.

354
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,040
I was very interested in that and so I thought, okay, look, how would we, how would we

355
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:00,120
examine quarterback decision making?

356
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:04,760
And so what are the, tell us about the model that you came up with to, to do that?

357
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,280
Well, what I wanted to do is predict, use a model to try to predict which quarterbacks,

358
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,040
or which receiver of the five eligible receivers a quarterback would throw to.

359
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,800
The idea was that I wanted to identify those quarterbacks who are making good reads and

360
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,240
identifying the best receiver to throw to.

361
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,640
So this is a decision, the SMA.

362
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,520
He has to choose between one and five to try to throw to.

363
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,120
And that's the key decision I wanted to look at.

364
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:37,560
So what the model was trying to do is try to look at the play itself, look at the presentation,

365
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:43,280
the geometry, the velocities, the positions of all the players on the field and say, who

366
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:48,600
should an NFL quarterback throw to, given this picture presented to the quarterback?

367
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,000
The idea was, it was kind of a epistemological sleight of hand, it was like, well, these

368
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
quarterbacks are all really, really good, they're the best in the world.

369
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,720
So the average typical quarterback is probably making the right decision.

370
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:07,480
And therefore I'm going to compare each individual quarterback's performance, who, you know,

371
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:13,600
which receiver he does throw to with what the model suggests the best receiver to throw

372
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,840
to would be.

373
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,600
And so that was the idea.

374
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:26,400
And did your data include characteristics of the receiver or is it solely based on the

375
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:36,120
play geometry and the options available from a field position perspective as opposed to

376
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:40,960
the, you know, some kind of data talking about the receiver's performance historically

377
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,880
in that kind of situation?

378
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:50,320
No, unfortunately, no, the, there's really no, like, the data has no like Z axis.

379
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,960
So there's no, we don't know how high or how high jumps or how high the ball was thrown

380
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,680
or we don't, we don't know that we do know things about the receiver as far as what's

381
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:07,400
his velocities and accelerations and things like that, which his individual talents certainly

382
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,000
are big influences on.

383
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,920
So, you know, but what we don't, what we don't have is the hands, you know, some receivers

384
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:18,640
are just have better hands, they just have a knack for catching balls.

385
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:24,680
So unfortunately, you know, but we're aggregating over, you know, a large, very large data set.

386
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:31,200
So the, you know, the idea there is that it's going to average out.

387
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:40,240
So you create this model that is trained on the historical decisions that quarterbacks

388
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,160
make again with this assumption that they're all good quarterbacks and then you want to

389
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:51,520
be able to compare any given quarterback decision with this model to see if it was, you

390
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,640
know, a good decision or maybe the quarterback kind of, you know, made a bad decision under

391
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,640
pressure or something.

392
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,640
That's the general idea.

393
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,640
Yeah.

394
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:05,160
So the idea is to isolate the contribution of quarterback decision making to, so performance.

395
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,040
So we can observe the performance on the field.

396
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,320
We see, okay, that was a ten yard catch or that was incomplete pass, for example.

397
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:18,520
How much was the quarterback decision contributing to success and failure in these plays?

398
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,560
So I was thinking of a quarterback, if you're a football fan, you may be familiar with

399
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:29,440
a quarterback named Tyrod Taylor, who is infamous for overlooking open receivers.

400
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,240
And instead of throwing an open receiver, he was a little bit gun shy, he would take

401
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
off of running.

402
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,560
He was a very fast runner.

403
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,640
And it was not a bad quarterback, but he just got, he was, coaches were very frustrated

404
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,840
with him for that.

405
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,480
And so I thought, can we identify something like this?

406
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,640
Who's a good, who's making good reads and who's making poor reads?

407
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,720
And so let's say, in the case of Tyrod Taylor, there is a receiver that's open, the model

408
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,720
sees it.

409
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,920
It says, hey, a typical NFL quarterback has an eight would throw to this receiver, 80%

410
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,920
of the time.

411
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:08,560
Tyrod is throwing to some, you know, running back, who's, you know, two yards deep instead,

412
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,280
who the model doesn't think he should throw to.

413
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:17,040
And then we would use those comparisons to make a judgment about quarterback decision-making

414
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,040
abilities.

415
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,040
Yeah.

416
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:28,560
Does the model also work the other way, meaning can it identify quarterbacks that are able

417
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:37,960
to, you know, have a higher than normal success percentage throwing to unlikely receivers

418
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,320
or something like that?

419
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,200
Yeah, absolutely. And in fact, that's, that's what happened.

420
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:49,040
So the assumption about that kind of, you know, hand waving, I mentioned earlier, it wasn't

421
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,040
really true.

422
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:55,320
And what happens is, like, you want to say, like, hey, Aaron Rodgers is really good quarterback,

423
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:58,080
he makes good reads, do what Aaron Rodgers would do.

424
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,600
Just make the same decision he would make and you, you would tell it rookie to do that.

425
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,440
But that would be calamitous because that rookie doesn't have the same skills and you

426
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,680
have the same accuracy, the same arm strength, necessarily as Aaron Rodgers.

427
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:15,160
So Aaron Rodgers is making different reads, making more aggressive reads than, say, a typical

428
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,360
quarterback because he can't, right?

429
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,920
There's a selection effect.

430
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:25,240
And so, yeah, so, you know, the, the insight is in the difference, you know, from the, from

431
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
the predicted.

432
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,520
So the model is just there to establish a baseline.

433
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,920
And then what's interesting is, are the deviations from the base?

434
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,920
Right.

435
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,920
Right.

436
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:41,040
Like, yeah, tell us more about this model, what, what kind of model is it?

437
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,760
It's, it's a neural network, very vanilla.

438
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,640
It's just a feed forward network.

439
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,160
I was really just getting started and I just wanted something that would work.

440
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,960
So there's some other, other, you know, different kinds of models you could use.

441
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,200
Some of the, the previous work in soccer and basketball had, would take the player tracking

442
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,760
data kind of create a graphical image of player trajectories from that and then use

443
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:16,040
convolutional neural networks or LSTM type recurrent neural networks.

444
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:21,080
I just, I just took a snapshot in time and pass release and looked at the play and looked

445
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:26,080
at where the receivers were, where the defenders were, all the relative geometries and velocities

446
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,960
and built a, built a, I think it's this four layer feed forward network.

447
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,440
And at the, at the end of it, you could ask it just about any question.

448
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,080
So it was, what's kind of modular, I would say, tell me like we've been talking about

449
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:48,120
until now, predict which of the five receivers you think this quarterback should throw

450
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,120
to.

451
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:56,040
And or I could replace a predict the, the mean yardage gained you see on this play.

452
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:02,680
Or predict the whether or not this is going to be intercepted or not or completed or incomplete.

453
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:09,160
So you could ask the model the same question and the, what really surprised me was that when

454
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,240
I was going through and kind of tuning all the hyper parameters, all the, you know, number

455
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,880
of nodes and layers and things like that, it was really in, the results were invariant

456
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:22,960
to that structure, where the structure was really dependent on the, the data.

457
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,840
And since I was feeding it the same data, but asking it different questions, I could keep

458
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,480
the same network structure and just kind of change the, the final layer and get, get

459
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,120
very good results.

460
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,280
The network was relatively straightforward.

461
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,960
Did you, you mentioned R earlier?

462
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,040
Did you end up doing this in R or something else?

463
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Yeah.

464
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:50,440
Well, it's a plug in through Python, but I used to say an Excel plug.

465
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,080
Yeah, no, I've graduated from those days.

466
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,560
I'm on R cripple.

467
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:05,080
I mean, I'm fluent in R and, but I can probably, you know, order dinner in Python, but that's

468
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,080
about it.

469
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:14,760
But there's a great plug in through R. So, and since I was doing all the data, building

470
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,200
and processing through R, it was very handy to just stay in that environment.

471
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:26,280
So, yeah, Keras with, with TensorFlow on the, on the back end, and it, it, it, it, it's,

472
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,800
it converged and started giving me result.

473
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,960
I was very surprised.

474
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
I'm my first try.

475
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,480
Um, I was very excited when I started getting, uh, good results.

476
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,040
You know, we talked a little bit about the structure of this data.

477
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:43,520
You've got kind of games that are aggregates of plays and then you've got, um, you know,

478
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,200
four years worth of games.

479
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:53,040
How much of this data did you use to train on and what, did you find that, uh, you know,

480
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,400
how much of it kind of got you to the point of diminishing returns?

481
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,680
Uh, well, I used all the data I could.

482
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:02,000
I didn't, I didn't really try to find out how little data I needed.

483
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,880
Um, so I, I got, I guess, so I was using, um, I split the data into the three parts.

484
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,120
So, you know, training, validation, and then test, and the test was set aside as just

485
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,280
the, um, the, the current season at the time.

486
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,440
So when I was writing up the paper, so that was the 2018 season.

487
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,280
So I've got about three quarters of that 2018 season is, or it's kind of a test set.

488
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,280
Then all the training and validation, all the tweaking and things that was done using,

489
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:40,160
like about a 70, 30 split of, uh, the, the two seasons of 2020, 16 and 17, I suppose.

490
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:47,760
And then, uh, and that, that, that was useful because the, the test results, right, which

491
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,240
hadn't touched any of the, the training or validation data, it'd never been seen by the

492
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,280
model in any, in any form.

493
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,120
Um, that was the current season.

494
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:02,080
So we could do actual analysis, like real world analysis using, using the test results.

495
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:10,600
Is the model trained on a play at a time or, uh, and do you, is it trained, I'm assuming

496
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:14,800
it's trained on only passing play, so you're filtering out that out based on these tags

497
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:20,000
and, and you're training it as a, on a play at a time, or is there some other structure

498
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,160
for the training data?

499
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,240
Yeah, it's, it's only passing plays.

500
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,440
And, in fact, it's only targeted passing plays.

501
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,280
So any, any plays that were kind of throw away, um, got it throw away.

502
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,960
So quarterback just didn't want to get sacked, so he throws it out of bounds.

503
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,960
Yeah.

504
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
Uh, those were discussed.

505
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,960
So there was no target on it.

506
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
I couldn't predict what, what the target was.

507
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,800
Theoretically, you could make that a sixth option.

508
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,600
I, I retrospect, but that wasn't really what I was interested in at the time.

509
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
Yeah.

510
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
Yeah.

511
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,600
And then, um, yeah.

512
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:51,080
So it's, it's trained, uh, yeah, basically a play, you know, the, the atom of this

513
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,880
model is, is one play.

514
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,760
Um, and, and, you know, but there was a batch of plays, obviously, that was fed through,

515
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,920
um, you know, for the, for the, for the training.

516
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,120
And how many plays total?

517
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,480
Did you have access to your data, Seth?

518
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:10,520
How, I think about a little bit foggy, but totally, about 36,000, wow.

519
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,520
Okay.

520
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,520
Plays, past plays.

521
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,520
Yeah.

522
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,640
And which I think is more than sufficient.

523
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:21,600
Um, but I also had, I, I did this trick, um, where I just took the mirror image of every

524
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:29,280
play and added that, uh, to, to the, uh, to the data, um, yet to be careful not to have

525
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,720
a mirror, uh, have the mirror image be both in the validation or, um, or training, right?

526
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,400
So you have to, you have to segregate those.

527
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,840
But that way you're, you're getting even, you're getting even more data, um, with the

528
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,560
assumption that there's symmetry, uh, to a play.

529
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,000
So somebody who's wide open on the right side of the field would be wide open, just as wide

530
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,520
open on the left side of the field.

531
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,680
And that's generally true, except for quarterback handedness, you can have right handed

532
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:59,040
quarterbacks, left handed quarterbacks, that might have an effect, um, but they're, they

533
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,400
have to be no left handed quarterbacks for the last few years.

534
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,400
So.

535
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Okay.

536
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,320
That's an interesting approach to data augmentation.

537
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:14,960
So when you do that mirroring given the handedness of the quarterbacks, are you just mirroring

538
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,600
the line structure?

539
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,960
I guess you're, the quarterback is just a point here so that doesn't matter, right?

540
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,960
Yeah.

541
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,920
Just like I was, you know, I just picked up this common technique with, um, you know, like,

542
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,920
computer vision techniques, right?

543
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,280
So if you want to identify a picture of a dog, you know, the dog kind of looking to the

544
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,720
right, if you flip that image with a dog looking to the left, they're both dogs.

545
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:38,720
Right.

546
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,040
Um, so that, that was the idea, um, but it, it's complicated like I had to do it by hand

547
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,040
essentially.

548
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:50,040
So I have to, you know, do all these kind of geometric transformations, uh, including

549
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,680
with all the angles as well.

550
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,920
So, um, if you're heading, if you're heading zero, three zero on the, on the true play,

551
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,880
on the mirrored play, you're heading, uh, you know, three, three zero, right?

552
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:07,280
So, um, yeah, I was a little bit laborious, but, but, uh, it was in, in the interest of

553
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,440
eating up the, the performance metric by one or two points.

554
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
Okay.

555
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,560
Uh, and you mentioned that you're, you segregated your, uh, validation and test sets based

556
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:26,560
on the season, did you, uh, explore, you know, something that was more randomized or the,

557
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,040
you know, any kind of implications of kind of bias season to season, like over a long

558
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,240
time periods of time, players get, you know, better and stronger.

559
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,400
Does that have any effect in a, a short term season to season?

560
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:46,240
Well, yeah, I didn't do that, um, but it is well known that, um, quarterbacks to take

561
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,040
a jump after their rookie year.

562
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:51,800
So they're basically there, from their second year on, it's kind of their, their steady

563
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,040
state performance level.

564
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,480
So if you really want to know, like what, what, what is this quarterbacks career going

565
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,640
to look like?

566
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,280
With, with very rare exceptions, his, his second full season is very representative of,

567
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:05,600
you know, he's pretty much hit his, his steady state at that point.

568
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:11,800
So, um, but now, so because, you know, we, we, we aggregated the, the, the idea at first,

569
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,720
anyway, there's a fourth variant of them I'll haven't talked about, but, um, there's

570
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:22,160
a, uh, uh, it's basically the aggregation, the average quarterback, all kind of blended

571
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,800
into one, um, was, was kind of like the, the proto, uh, deep QB.

572
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:28,800
Okay.

573
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:36,800
And so you kind of ignored the, you know, any implications of testing based on the totally

574
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,040
separate season, as opposed to kind of randomized testing.

575
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:47,080
We did, we did find that the, the 2018 performance was, we're, there was a drop in performance

576
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,960
like you, you would typically expect, um, but there was an unusual, unusually high number

577
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:57,160
of rookies, um, there was, it was it, it was generally an up year for passing.

578
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:02,760
So there's year to year variants, um, due to things like, uh, just randomness, rule

579
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,520
changes, uh, injuries to some of the elite quarterbacks will change, um, overall passing,

580
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,760
the level of passing performance, uh, for the league as a whole year to year, uh, last

581
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,760
year was a, was a big up year.

582
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,040
Um, so yeah, there might be something, uh, to that, uh, you mentioned a fourth variant

583
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,280
to the model.

584
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,280
Yeah.

585
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:28,680
This was the coolest one, but it didn't really, it didn't work as well as I had hoped,

586
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,240
but it was so, I thought the idea was so cool.

587
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,360
I had to put it in the paper anyway, people were like, yeah, there's two longer papers

588
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:38,520
you got to cut it out, um, cut this part out and I was like, no, it's too cool.

589
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,280
Um, so the idea was to use, uh, transfer learning.

590
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:47,240
So, um, it's, it's kind of inspired by the same way, let's say biological brains work.

591
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:53,200
So think of quarterback has to have these very intuitive and distinctive parts of his brain

592
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:00,440
that understand things like distance and motion and, um, you know, speeds and this kind

593
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,640
of intuitive, uh, physics model in, in our brains and we generally share those, right?

594
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,520
We're all pretty good drivers, right?

595
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,960
We're all, you can't, you know, humans have these share these, these faculties, but we

596
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:16,080
don't all have the same decision-making, uh, I have an 18 year old son.

597
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:21,520
So I know we don't all share the same decision, he's a very, he's, he's a very good decision

598
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,240
maker actually for, for an 18 year old, but I was 18 once too, uh, so we don't all share

599
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,480
the same, um, decision-making abilities, uh, so those executive functions may tend to

600
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:36,320
differ much more than the, the lower level, uh, functions and those are the, you, you could

601
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,000
model it the same way with neural networks.

602
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,160
So the, so what I did was trained the lower level, the lower layers, lower level layers

603
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,080
of the model on the, on the data set as a whole, just like I had done with the, that we've

604
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:51,440
been talking about.

605
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,000
And then what I would do is take the, the, like the top layers, which we could think of

606
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,160
as the, the executive functions, the ones that, okay, we've digested this play.

607
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,080
We understand, um, you know, where people are and what's important to look at and the

608
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:08,080
relative velocities and things like that.

609
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,760
Now, let's make a decision about who to throw to.

610
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:17,520
And so those top layer, we, we froze the base layers, retrain the top layers, uh, just

611
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,560
on the, um, on an individual quarterback.

612
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:21,560
Uh-huh.

613
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:26,840
And then we could, we could say, we could take like a Tom Brady or like I did with a paper,

614
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:32,480
I took Drew Breeze and, um, uh, you could, you could basically download Drew Breeze's

615
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,520
brain into, uh, you know, into a USB, um, drive or something like that would be the idea.

616
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,400
And then just like we said before, like do what Aaron Rogers would do, right?

617
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,480
So we, now we have a model of what Aaron Rogers would do or what Drew Breeze would do, given

618
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,480
certain situations.

619
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,880
So we could actually take a situation that Tom Brady was in and replace him with a rookie

620
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,800
and say now, you know, what would the rookie do compared to Tom Brady in this same exact

621
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,800
situation?

622
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:05,000
Um, um, it was pretty ambitious, uh, the, the results weren't as interesting as I, as

623
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,320
I thought, um, partially because the rookie, the rookies tend to throw a lot of checkdowns,

624
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:15,400
which means they, they throw to, they throw short passes to relatively safe receivers,

625
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,120
um, rather than taking a lot of risks.

626
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:22,320
And the Saints offense happens to do that by design a lot, uh, they like, they have very

627
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,840
good running backs last year and so, uh, Drew Breeze came up, so we ran a similarity

628
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:32,200
metrics and all the rookies, uh, came up very similar to, to do Breeze, which is not

629
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:34,600
what I, I had hope to see.

630
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:40,240
And was that the only quarterback you tried to apply it to or was, or did you apply it

631
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:46,120
to all of them and you found that it was kind of similarly not all that interesting for

632
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,120
all of them?

633
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,120
Yeah.

634
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:54,920
Well, I tried some of the, uh, consensus elite, uh, quarterbacks of Brady's, um, Rogers,

635
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,280
um, Breeze, and I can't think, I can't remember if I did with anyone else, but, uh, you

636
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:04,360
know, I, I, I chose Breeze, the results were, were decent with him.

637
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,560
And so, uh, researchers, progative, that's the one I, I put in the paper.

638
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,560
Interesting.

639
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:10,560
Yeah.

640
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,480
That would have been really interesting if it were to, yeah, but it was just, it was just

641
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,480
the first stab.

642
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:21,760
I mean, really, this is the first, um, research like this is, uh, uh, beyond this is common

643
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,880
place in basketball and soccer, but this is just the first stab at it with, with football

644
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,280
or just kind of like, what's the, let's take a moonshot here.

645
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:35,040
If we could do something, the coolest thing we, we want to do, uh, go, go run with it and,

646
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,880
and see how far you can, you can carry the ball.

647
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,320
What are your priorities for kind of pushing this further?

648
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,080
Do you, do you use a relatively simple model?

649
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:50,800
Do you think, uh, kind of a deeper, you know, state of the art, CNN might perform better

650
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:57,880
or, you know, doing different things with the data and, you know, finding, uh, additional

651
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,400
data sources to, uh, kind of supplement what you already have, like what, what do you

652
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,640
have in mind for pushing this further?

653
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,320
Well, the, the next step would be something that we, we could run this, what first time

654
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,280
you say, we can run this model at 18 kind of time step in the play, you know, well before

655
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,040
the past actually takes place, and so we can have a continuous analysis as the plague

656
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,040
goes on.

657
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:23,640
Um, but it's only trained on when, when the past is actually released.

658
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:31,440
Um, the, the next step I would do if I had the time, um, would apply LSTM, um, models

659
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,760
to, to the data, uh, throughout the, you know, so it would be continuous from the snap

660
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:42,720
all the way, uh, through past release, and so we're accumulating information from the

661
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:48,560
entire play, not just a time sliver at, um, past release, but, but do you keep in mind

662
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,600
we do have velocity and acceleration information on each player, which kind of gives us, you

663
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:59,200
know, back, you know, two time steps, I guess, right, uh, worth of information.

664
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,200
But I think we can accumulate even more information.

665
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:08,280
I, I don't think CNN's would be, would perform as well in theory because what the CNN's are

666
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:14,680
trying to do is, is to get position and get the geometries, get the relative information

667
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:22,000
from, from a graphic, uh, and then you, you, you apply that, um, you know, further down

668
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,240
stream in a model, whereas we, we'd already have the X's and Y's and the distances and

669
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:32,400
geometries and angles that, CNN would have to learn along the way.

670
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:38,240
Um, so we can, uh, so I think using the raw inputs, the X Y's, the distances, uh,

671
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:44,360
some, some features that are engineered, uh, kind of relative distances to nearest past

672
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,880
coverage, uh, player, things like that, I think, would, uh, perform best.

673
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:58,760
And I'm curious to, the extent to which explainability has come up, um, for, for you, do you

674
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:05,200
get asked to, you know, be able to produce, uh, some justification for the predictions

675
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:11,000
that the model is making and how have you, uh, have you handled that?

676
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,760
Yeah, that's a tough question.

677
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,160
Um, you, sometimes there's some head, head scratching results, you know, you don't

678
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,840
under, why is the model saying that?

679
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:25,000
And most of the time, though, it's very understandable and plausible, kind of obvious, um, but

680
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:30,240
the, uh, on a case by case basis, you can look at these plays and, and, you know, make

681
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,720
it, make a human judgment.

682
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:37,000
Oh, if you know enough football, you understand why it's, it's making the decision it is,

683
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,560
the model's working the way it is.

684
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:43,680
Um, but, you know, unfortunately, explainability is a tough problem with neural networks.

685
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,960
Um, there, you know, if, if I had the time, what I would do is I'd build like a, an app

686
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,280
and application where you could kind of dial in, you could just drag and drop, um, players

687
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,840
on a screen.

688
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,840
And, uh, some of the Disney research guys I talked to had actually done this with, with

689
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:06,720
basketball, or you could kind of move the players around and then see how that affects

690
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,440
the, the model outputs.

691
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:14,720
And that way you can directly, um, you know, test well, if I make this player closer

692
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,480
to this other player, how does that affect things?

693
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,320
If I make them further away, if I make them faster, how does that?

694
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,040
So just by trial and error, you can, you can come to some form of understanding, but

695
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:29,120
some general understanding about it is, is, uh, um, a difficult task.

696
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:37,080
Awesome project or what suggestions would you have for, uh, folks that, you know, are listening

697
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:44,320
to this also have a passion for sports and want to, uh, experiment with, uh, these types

698
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:49,360
of models, uh, applied to, to sports.

699
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:55,840
Well, there is player tracking data available, um, even for football, even for NFL football,

700
00:48:55,840 --> 00:49:00,200
but there are databases out there, some soccer, basketball is a little bit harder to get

701
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,200
a hold of.

702
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,520
I can't give you any, you know, I don't have a URL for you right now, but, um, except in

703
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,520
football.

704
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:14,640
So the NFL at the combine, um, uh, in the spring, late winter, early spring, the, at the

705
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,360
combine, they held a, what they called a big data bowl.

706
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:24,200
And with that, they released a subset of games, I think maybe about nine weeks, um, worth

707
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:32,560
of games, and they released that data, uh, for, um, it basically caggle type competition.

708
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:36,680
And then they, they had their winners and, um, you know, their finalists and announced

709
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,160
the winner there at the combine.

710
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,280
So that data, um, still exists out there on the, on the, on the web somewhere, so just

711
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:49,520
Google, uh, big NFL big data bowl, um, and, uh, it'll take you to, um, it'll take you

712
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,520
to that, that site.

713
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,320
And I think it's still available.

714
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,800
There are definite limitations on what you can do with that data.

715
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:01,520
Um, the other thing is the NFL put out a punt play data in caggle, and that may still be

716
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,520
available as well.

717
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:07,080
So if you're interested, um, that, that's a, that's a great place to get started, just,

718
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:11,520
just with the, with the data, um, but it, it's, uh, it's a lot to get your arm around.

719
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:15,280
You have to start, you know, learning like, okay, that zero, zero point, where is that

720
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,280
on the field?

721
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,440
Is that at the back of the end zone?

722
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,080
Is that, is this left oriented, right oriented?

723
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,280
Is it, you know, which way is the, the zero?

724
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,840
A degree, uh, heading access on here and, uh, is this in degrees or radiant?

725
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,920
You know, all those things, that takes a while.

726
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:32,400
So it's, it's definitely a chore, but, um, it was, it was a lot of fun.

727
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,840
Well, Brian, thanks so much for taking the time to chat with us really, really interesting
