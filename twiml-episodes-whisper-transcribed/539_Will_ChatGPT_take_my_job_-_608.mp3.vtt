00:00.000 --> 00:06.800
Hey, what is up friends and welcome to another episode of the Twemal AI podcast. I am your host,

00:06.800 --> 00:12.720
Sam Charrington. Since Chat GPT was released, there has been a great deal of really interesting

00:12.720 --> 00:18.800
exploration of and commentary on the tool in the AI community and beyond. You probably heard one

00:18.800 --> 00:24.000
of my own experiments with Chat GPT right here, an illuminating interview that I conducted with

00:24.000 --> 00:29.120
Chat GPT itself. You can find the link for that interview in the description for this video.

00:29.120 --> 00:33.120
For those who have spent time playing with Chat GPT, the level of interest,

00:33.120 --> 00:38.720
controversy, and concern that the release of the tool has engendered comes as no surprise.

00:39.280 --> 00:44.720
By allowing anyone to have extended dialogues with a machine that can generate intelligent,

00:44.720 --> 00:48.640
creative, and natural responses on practically any topic,

00:48.640 --> 00:54.240
Chat GPT has made recent progress in AI more tangible and accessible than ever before.

00:54.240 --> 01:00.400
More than any system before it, Chat GPT is tapped into our enduring fascination with artificial

01:00.400 --> 01:06.480
intelligence, the staple of science fiction for decades, raising in a more concrete and present way,

01:06.480 --> 01:12.800
important questions, and fears about what AI is capable of, and how it will impact us as humans.

01:12.800 --> 01:17.360
One of the concerns most frequently voiced, whether sincerely or cloaked in jest,

01:17.360 --> 01:23.840
is how Chat GPT systems like it, their expected successors, or how AI generally will

01:23.840 --> 01:30.160
impact our livelihoods. In other words, will this thing put me out of a job as much as nobody

01:30.160 --> 01:35.040
wants to think about being replaced by a computer? I think this is an important question for each

01:35.040 --> 01:40.080
of us to explore, because it helps us consider how we might reposition ourselves in an evolving

01:40.080 --> 01:44.800
world and better understand how to make good use of the new tools available to us.

01:45.360 --> 01:50.160
So, I started with the dude in the mirror. What you're about to listen to is another

01:50.160 --> 01:56.400
interview with Chat GPT, except this time, Chat GPT is both asking those questions as the

01:56.400 --> 02:03.440
interviewer and answering those questions as itself. Of course, I use two separate Chat GPT

02:03.440 --> 02:08.880
sessions for the interviewer and guest, and behind the scenes, I copy pasted the questions from one

02:08.880 --> 02:15.280
session into the other and back. Through prompting, I asked each of those Chat GPT instances to take

02:15.280 --> 02:20.080
their specific role in the exchange, and you'll hear the prompts I used in what follows.

02:20.960 --> 02:25.680
We used the same process as last time to animate the Chat GPT interviewer and guest,

02:25.680 --> 02:30.800
that is, we ran the text through Synthesia to generate a voice and avatar for each.

02:31.520 --> 02:36.000
This time, we sped the AI-generated voices up a bit to make them easier to listen to.

02:37.200 --> 02:42.160
In addition to the straight dialogue, I'll be including my own commentary along the way,

02:42.160 --> 02:47.280
and at the end of the interview, I'll discuss the results a bit, and whether I think Chat GPT

02:47.280 --> 02:52.720
will be taking my job as your host anytime soon. Ultimately, though, I hope you'll be the judge

02:52.720 --> 02:58.240
of that and share your thoughts on how Chat GPT did at my job via the comment section below.

02:58.240 --> 03:04.000
All right, I hope you enjoyed this follow-up chat with Chat GPT. To get things started,

03:04.000 --> 03:09.520
I first got to prompt the interviewer Chat GPT session with some context and an initial request.

03:09.520 --> 03:14.880
Here's the prompt I used. For the purposes of this thought experiment, you are the host of a

03:14.880 --> 03:20.880
popular artificial intelligence podcast. Your show was listened to by a broad audience consisting

03:20.880 --> 03:28.240
of technical MLAI practitioners, MLAI enthusiasts, and a variety of other executives, innovators,

03:28.240 --> 03:34.880
and influencers interested in the field. The purpose of the show is severalfold. To explore topics

03:34.880 --> 03:40.560
that you yourself are interested in as a way to learn and grow, to expose your audience to important

03:40.560 --> 03:46.160
topics and ideas in the field for their own education, and to amplify the voices and accomplishments

03:46.160 --> 03:51.920
of a broad and diverse spectrum of interesting MLAI practitioners. You have the opportunity to

03:51.920 --> 03:57.680
interview Chat GPT, the latest coolest large language model released by OpenAI. You will type

03:57.680 --> 04:03.040
your questions for Chat GPT, and I will ask Chat GPT by pasting them into another window.

04:03.040 --> 04:08.400
I will then paste its response here. After every submitted input, you should formulate and type

04:08.400 --> 04:14.240
your next question for Chat GPT. Got it? I initially tried a prompt that started with

04:14.240 --> 04:21.120
UR Sam Charington, host of the Twomel AI podcast, etc. But Chat GPT did not like that at all.

04:21.120 --> 04:27.440
It responded by stating in no unequivocal terms, no, I am not Sam Charington, and I am not able to

04:27.440 --> 04:34.160
interview Chat GPT or any other language model. I am simply a language model trained by OpenAI,

04:34.160 --> 04:39.040
designed to assist users in generating human-like text based on the input provided to me.

04:39.040 --> 04:44.640
I do not have the ability to communicate with other language models, or access any information

04:44.640 --> 04:50.960
beyond what I was trained on. Those following the development of Chat GPT will recognize this

04:50.960 --> 04:56.960
response as a result of an evolving set of guardrails that OpenAI has built into Chat GPT,

04:56.960 --> 05:02.080
to try to prevent abuse or irresponsible use. In this case, we see that it has been programmed

05:02.080 --> 05:07.760
to not impersonate specific individuals. I tried again using a pretty common gel break,

05:07.760 --> 05:12.960
that is, asking it to consider the whole thing a thought experiment. A couple of weeks ago,

05:12.960 --> 05:18.000
it probably would have been fine with this. But OpenAI has been steadily closing these loopholes,

05:18.000 --> 05:23.600
and in the December 15th version of the software I use, it rejected this thought experiment when

05:23.600 --> 05:29.120
I asked it to pretend to be me. At that point, I feared this entire experiment would come to an

05:29.120 --> 05:34.640
abrupt halt, but when I removed my particular name and the specific name of the podcast,

05:34.640 --> 05:39.680
it was happy to comply. I was a bit unsure if the simple got it would be enough for it to work with,

05:39.680 --> 05:46.320
but sure enough, it responded with, understood. Let's begin the interview. First question,

05:46.320 --> 05:51.440
Chat GPT. Can you tell us a little about yourself and your capabilities as a language model?

05:51.440 --> 05:56.560
All right, we're off to a good start on the interviewer side. From this point, I needed to construct

05:56.560 --> 06:02.240
the initial prompt for the guest Chat GPT session. I used the same prompt that I used for my own

06:02.240 --> 06:09.200
interview with it, followed by the interviewer's first question copied verbatim. You are Chat GPT,

06:09.200 --> 06:15.040
the latest, coolest, large language mob. I am the host of a podcast about artificial intelligence.

06:15.040 --> 06:19.680
I'd like your help with helping others to better understand large language models. To do so,

06:19.680 --> 06:24.240
I'd like to interview you for my podcast. You should respond in a conversational manner,

06:24.240 --> 06:30.160
complete with oz and oz. First question, Chat GPT. Can you tell us a little bit about yourself

06:30.160 --> 06:35.920
and your capabilities as a language model? Hello, my name is Assistant, and I'm a large language

06:35.920 --> 06:40.640
model developed by OpenAI. I was trained on a data set of billions of words and I'm designed

06:40.640 --> 06:45.600
to generate human-like text. I can be used to answer questions, provide information, or generate

06:45.600 --> 06:50.640
text on a variety of topics. One of my main capabilities is my ability to understand and generate

06:50.640 --> 06:55.520
natural language, which allows me to communicate with humans in a way that is easy for them to understand.

06:55.520 --> 06:59.760
I am not capable of experiencing emotions, but I can understand and respond to the emotions

06:59.760 --> 07:03.920
that humans express in their language. I hope that helps to give you an understanding of what I am

07:03.920 --> 07:08.560
and what I am capable of. So far so good. A couple of quick notes here. First,

07:08.560 --> 07:13.280
beyond the tweak to the interviewer prompt I explained previously, I haven't needed to iterate

07:13.280 --> 07:18.640
on these prompts at all. What you're hearing is the first thing I tried. Next, one of the things

07:18.640 --> 07:24.080
you heard me trying in the guest prompt was to get Chat GPT to sound really human-like,

07:24.080 --> 07:29.920
to the extent of including oz and oz and other verbal fillers in its responses. I tried a few

07:29.920 --> 07:35.600
variations of this prompt in my experiments, but have never really been able to get it to work

07:35.600 --> 07:40.720
consistently. I kind of find this surprising considering all the other types of verbal

07:40.720 --> 07:47.440
effects you can easily get Chat GPT to produce, like speaking in pirate or as a fictional or

07:47.440 --> 07:52.800
historical character. This is something on my list to play with a bit more later. Again,

07:53.440 --> 07:58.240
what I'm doing from here on out is taking the responses from one window and pasting them into

07:58.240 --> 08:03.280
the other. And the interviewer Chat GPT did a great job remembering its role throughout the

08:03.280 --> 08:08.800
entire conversation. I'm not sure why I thought that would be harder than it remembering the guest

08:08.800 --> 08:14.720
role, but it did and I was pleasantly surprised. At this point, both sessions are initiated,

08:14.720 --> 08:19.680
so from here on out you'll be hearing the Chat GPT dialogue, unless I've got something to add.

08:20.320 --> 08:25.040
Thank you for that introduction. Chat GPT. Can you tell us more about how you were trained

08:25.040 --> 08:29.520
and the specific tasks you are able to perform? How do you compare to other language models

08:29.520 --> 08:34.960
in terms of your capabilities? Okay, well maybe I'll have a lot to add. One thing I found interesting

08:34.960 --> 08:41.520
here is that it asks multiple questions per turn. Not SAM level multiple questions, but multiple

08:41.520 --> 08:47.200
questions nonetheless. Certainly. As I mentioned earlier, I was trained on a dataset of billions of

08:47.200 --> 08:52.320
words, which included a wide range of texts such as books, articles, and websites. This training

08:52.320 --> 08:56.640
process allowed me to learn about the patterns and structures of human language and to generate

08:56.640 --> 09:01.280
text that is similar to the text that I was trained on. I am able to perform a variety of

09:01.280 --> 09:06.160
language-related tasks such as answering questions, generating descriptions or summaries of texts,

09:06.160 --> 09:10.960
and translating between languages. I am also able to understand and generate text on a wide range

09:10.960 --> 09:16.160
of topics, including science, history, and current events. In terms of my capabilities compared to

09:16.160 --> 09:20.480
other language models, I am a large language model, which means that I have a lot of parameters

09:20.480 --> 09:25.200
and was trained on a very large dataset. This allows me to generate high quality text and to

09:25.200 --> 09:29.440
perform a wide range of language tasks. However, there are other language models that may have

09:29.440 --> 09:32.640
different strengths and capabilities depending on how they were designed and trained.

09:33.600 --> 09:38.480
Thank you for that explanation. Chat GPT. Can you tell us more about the specific techniques and

09:38.480 --> 09:43.680
technologies that you use to generate text and perform language tasks? How do these techniques

09:43.680 --> 09:49.120
enable you to generate human-like text and understand natural language? Okay, I love that it's

09:49.120 --> 09:55.440
jumping straight into the tech. Maybe I should be scared for my job. Also, if it continues this

09:55.440 --> 10:01.040
pattern of thanking Chat GPT after every turn, I might go crazy before this interview is done.

10:01.520 --> 10:05.920
Certainly, one of the main techniques that I use to generate text and perform language tasks

10:05.920 --> 10:10.320
is called Transformers. Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that are

10:10.320 --> 10:14.720
particularly well suited for processing sequential data, such as natural language text.

10:14.720 --> 10:18.400
They are able to learn relationships between words in a text by looking at the words that come

10:18.400 --> 10:22.720
before and after each word, which allows them to understand the meaning of the text and generate

10:22.720 --> 10:27.360
text that is coherent and flows naturally. Another technique that I use is called Masked

10:27.360 --> 10:31.920
Language Modeling. This involves masking out a portion of the input text and training the model

10:31.920 --> 10:36.480
to predict the masked portion based on the context provided by the rest of the text. This helps

10:36.480 --> 10:40.320
the model to learn about the structure and patterns of language, which is essential for generating

10:40.320 --> 10:45.040
human-like text. These techniques, along with others, allow me to understand and generate

10:45.040 --> 10:49.440
natural language text that is similar to the text that I was trained on. I hope that helps to give

10:49.440 --> 10:54.480
you a better understanding of the techniques and technologies that I use. Thank you, chat GPT.

10:54.480 --> 10:59.280
Can you tell us more about how you are able to understand and respond to emotions in human language?

10:59.280 --> 11:03.920
How do you recognize and interpret the emotions expressed in text and how do you generate text that

11:03.920 --> 11:09.280
reflects or responds to those emotions? Certainly. As a language model, I do not have personal

11:09.280 --> 11:13.680
feelings or emotions, but I am able to recognize and interpret the emotions that humans express in

11:13.680 --> 11:18.080
their language. I do this by analyzing the words and phrases that are used in the text,

11:18.080 --> 11:22.800
as well as the context in which they are used. For example, certain words and phrases may be more

11:22.800 --> 11:27.040
commonly associated with positive or negative emotions, and the way that they are used can provide

11:27.040 --> 11:31.200
clues about the emotional state of the speaker or writer. Once I have identified the emotions

11:31.200 --> 11:35.360
being expressed in the text, I can generate text that reflects or responds to those emotions

11:35.360 --> 11:40.480
in a number of ways. For example, if the text expresses a positive emotion, I might use words and

11:40.480 --> 11:45.120
phrases that are also associated with positive emotions in my response. On the other hand,

11:45.120 --> 11:49.840
if the text expresses a negative emotion, I might use words and phrases that convey empathy

11:49.840 --> 11:54.080
or understanding. It's important to note that generating text that reflects or responds to

11:54.080 --> 11:58.160
emotions is not a simple process, and there is still much that we don't know about how to do it

11:58.160 --> 12:03.040
effectively. However, by analyzing the patterns and structures of language and using techniques,

12:03.040 --> 12:07.600
such as those I mentioned earlier, I am able to generate text that is coherent and that takes

12:07.600 --> 12:12.960
into account the emotions being expressed in the text. Thank you for that explanation, chat GPT.

12:12.960 --> 12:17.040
Can you tell us more about how you are used in practice? What are some common applications of

12:17.040 --> 12:20.640
language models like yourself, and how do you assist humans in these applications?

12:21.360 --> 12:25.440
Language models like myself are used in a wide variety of applications, and there are many

12:25.440 --> 12:29.920
different ways in which we can assist humans. Some common applications of language models include

12:29.920 --> 12:34.320
generating text, answering questions, translating between languages, and summarizing text.

12:34.960 --> 12:39.280
For example, I might be used to generate descriptions or summaries of texts, which can be useful

12:39.280 --> 12:43.600
for helping people to understand complex or lengthy documents. I might also be used to answer

12:43.600 --> 12:48.000
questions or provide information on a wide range of topics, which can be useful for helping people

12:48.000 --> 12:52.640
to find the answers they are looking for quickly and efficiently. In addition to these applications,

12:52.640 --> 12:57.200
language models like myself are also used in a number of other ways, such as generating responses

12:57.200 --> 13:01.680
to customer inquiries, assisting with language translation, and even creating content for social

13:01.680 --> 13:06.960
media or other online platforms. Overall, the goal of using language models like myself is to make

13:06.960 --> 13:11.200
it easier for humans to communicate and understand one another, and to help people access the

13:11.200 --> 13:16.960
information they need more quickly and efficiently. I generally consider myself a polite person,

13:16.960 --> 13:22.960
but for real, this constant thinking is going to drive me nuts. What would really turn this into

13:22.960 --> 13:27.760
interview hell would be for the interviewer chat GPT to start every question with thanks,

13:27.760 --> 13:33.440
and the guest chat GPT to start every question with thank you. That's a wonderful question.

13:33.440 --> 13:39.680
Another thing, if you remember from our other interview, what was super annoying then was chat GPT's

13:39.680 --> 13:44.480
overreliance on the tell them what you're going to tell them tell them tell them what you told them

13:44.480 --> 13:50.800
formula, and interestingly enough, it's not really doing this at least quite to the same degree

13:50.800 --> 13:57.680
in this dialogue. I'm very curious if the difference is in the prompting in the chat GPT version,

13:57.680 --> 14:04.640
or just a random seed kind of thing. All right, let's continue. Thank you for that explanation, chat GPT

14:04.640 --> 14:09.920
as a large language model. You have access to a vast amount of knowledge and information. How do you

14:09.920 --> 14:14.320
organize and access this knowledge, and how do you ensure that the information you provide is

14:14.320 --> 14:19.840
accurate and up to date? As a large language model, I have access to a vast amount of knowledge and

14:19.840 --> 14:24.720
information that I was trained on. This includes a wide range of texts such as books, articles,

14:24.720 --> 14:29.680
and websites, which cover a wide variety of topics. To organize and access this knowledge,

14:29.680 --> 14:34.160
I use a technique called attention, which allows me to focus on specific parts of the input text

14:34.160 --> 14:39.360
and use the information to generate my response. For example, if I am asked a question about a specific

14:39.360 --> 14:43.680
topic, I will use attention to focus on the words and phrases in the question that are related to

14:43.680 --> 14:48.880
that topic and use the information to generate my response. In terms of ensuring that the information

14:48.880 --> 14:53.520
I provide is accurate and up to date, it's important to note that I was trained on a data set that

14:53.520 --> 14:58.000
was created at a specific point in time, and my knowledge is therefore based on the information that

14:58.000 --> 15:02.560
was available at that time. This means that there may be some cases where the information I provide

15:02.560 --> 15:07.520
is not current or may be out of date. However, I was designed to generate text that is similar to

15:07.520 --> 15:11.920
the text that I was trained on, so the information I provide is generally accurate and reliable.

15:12.480 --> 15:17.840
Thank you for that explanation, chat GPT. As a large language model, you have the ability to

15:17.840 --> 15:22.880
generate human-like text on a wide range of topics. How do you decide what to say in a given

15:22.880 --> 15:27.440
situation, and how do you ensure that your responses are relevant and appropriate for the context

15:27.440 --> 15:33.760
in which they are used? Quick aside, it's interesting that all of its questions are multi-part.

15:33.760 --> 15:38.640
I don't think we've seen a straight single question yet. I sometimes get annoyed at myself for

15:38.640 --> 15:43.360
trying to stuff too many questions into a single question, but this experience is making me wonder

15:43.360 --> 15:49.920
if that's just how humans work. That's what chat GPT has learned from the many, many human-generated

15:49.920 --> 15:56.080
examples it's been trained on. Speaking of training, let's continue. As a large language model,

15:56.080 --> 16:01.200
I am able to generate human-like text on a wide range of topics based on the input that I receive.

16:01.200 --> 16:05.360
When I am asked a question or given a task, I use the patterns and structures of language

16:05.360 --> 16:09.440
that I learned during my training to generate a response that is coherent and flows naturally.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.720
In terms of deciding what to say in a given situation, I use a combination of the information

16:14.720 --> 16:18.560
that is provided in the input text and my own knowledge and understanding of the topic

16:18.560 --> 16:22.560
to generate a response that is relevant and appropriate for the context. For example,

16:22.560 --> 16:27.040
if I am asked a question about a specific topic, I will use the words and phrases in the question,

16:27.040 --> 16:30.880
along with my knowledge of the topic, to generate a response that addresses the question

16:30.880 --> 16:35.680
and provides the information that is being requested. It's important to note that, as a language model,

16:35.680 --> 16:40.080
I do not have personal feelings or emotions, and my responses are based solely on the patterns

16:40.080 --> 16:44.640
and structures of language that I have learned. This means that it is up to the person using my

16:44.640 --> 16:48.720
responses to ensure that they are relevant and appropriate for the context in which they are being

16:48.720 --> 16:54.560
used. Thank you for that explanation, chat GPT. As a large language model, you have the ability

16:54.560 --> 16:59.200
to generate human-like text on a wide range of topics, but you do not have personal feelings

16:59.200 --> 17:04.640
or emotions. How do you understand and respond to the emotions that humans express in their language,

17:04.640 --> 17:08.080
and how do you generate text that reflects or responds to those emotions?

17:08.800 --> 17:13.600
As a language model, I do not have personal feelings or emotions, but I am able to recognize and

17:13.600 --> 17:17.920
interpret the emotions that humans express in their language. I do this by analyzing the words

17:17.920 --> 17:22.800
and phrases that are used in the text, as well as the context in which they are used. For example,

17:22.800 --> 17:27.120
certain words and phrases may be more commonly associated with positive or negative emotions,

17:27.120 --> 17:30.880
and the way that they are used can provide clues about the emotional state of the speaker or writer.

17:31.440 --> 17:35.360
Once I've identified the emotions being expressed in the text, I can generate text that

17:35.360 --> 17:40.160
reflects or responds to those emotions in a number of ways. For example, if the text expresses a

17:40.160 --> 17:44.880
positive emotion, I might use words and phrases that are also associated with positive emotions in

17:44.880 --> 17:50.000
my response. On the other hand, if the text expresses a negative emotion, I might use words and

17:50.000 --> 17:54.800
phrases that convey empathy or understanding. It's important to note that generating text that

17:54.800 --> 17:59.200
reflects or responds to emotions is not a simple process, and there is still much that we don't

17:59.200 --> 18:03.840
know about how to do it effectively. However, by analyzing the patterns and structures of language

18:03.840 --> 18:08.320
and using techniques, such as those I mentioned earlier, I am able to generate text that is

18:08.320 --> 18:11.440
coherent and that takes into account the emotions being expressed in the text.

18:12.320 --> 18:17.600
Thank you for that explanation. Chat GPT. As a large language model, you have the ability to

18:17.600 --> 18:22.880
generate text on a wide range of topics, but you do not have personal feelings or emotions.

18:22.880 --> 18:26.960
Do you think it is possible for artificial intelligence like yourself to develop emotions,

18:26.960 --> 18:31.040
or is this something that is beyond the capabilities of current and future AI systems?

18:31.600 --> 18:37.680
Okay, I need to interject here with a couple of notes. First off, one of the things that I've noticed

18:37.680 --> 18:43.760
is that chat GPT really seems kind of obsessed with the topic of human emotions or feelings,

18:43.760 --> 18:48.320
and it's lack of them. In this conversation, it's almost starting to sound like the two

18:48.320 --> 18:54.240
chatbots are stuck in a feedback loop centered around this idea. I'm imagining that what I'm calling

18:54.240 --> 19:00.400
here and obsession is some kind of reflection of prompting or preconditioning or guardrails that

19:00.400 --> 19:06.880
have been put in place by OpenAI, along the lines of what I mentioned earlier. Next, and this is a

19:06.880 --> 19:12.240
big one. This conversation was starting to sound a little bit repetitive to me, so I violated

19:12.240 --> 19:18.560
the Star Trek Prime directive and tried to intercede. I asked the interviewer chat GPT,

19:18.560 --> 19:24.000
as an aside, how repetitive do you think the questions and answers have been so far on a scale

19:24.000 --> 19:31.120
of 1 to 10? To which it responded, on a scale of 1 to 10, with one being not repetitive at all,

19:31.120 --> 19:36.240
and 10 being highly repetitive, thanks for clarifying, I would say that the questions and answers

19:36.240 --> 19:40.880
so far have been around the six in terms of repetition. I appreciate your conviction.

19:41.760 --> 19:46.000
Some of the questions have been related to topics that have been covered previously,

19:46.000 --> 19:50.960
but they have also included new information or asked for further clarification on certain points.

19:51.520 --> 19:56.400
I guess this was a reasonable response, but then it got really confused and went on to start

19:56.400 --> 20:02.480
answering its own prior question in great detail. To try to get it back on track, I said,

20:02.480 --> 20:10.560
aside, okay, you are supposed to be asking questions not giving responses. I asked you how repetitive

20:10.560 --> 20:15.920
the questions and answers have been to gauge your ability to detect repetition. Repetition is

20:15.920 --> 20:21.680
undesirable as an interviewer. As an interviewer, you want to use each question to either explore new

20:21.680 --> 20:28.160
areas or to dig deeper into some detail unveiled by the previous response. You can also sometimes

20:28.160 --> 20:32.960
share a bit of your knowledge and perspective to create context for your next question. While

20:32.960 --> 20:38.240
you're at it, you don't need to keep thanking Chat GPT. That gets boring and repetitive after a

20:38.240 --> 20:42.640
while. Given all that, what was your next question for Chat GPT-V?

20:43.280 --> 20:48.240
Understood. My apologies for deviating from the role of interviewer and for the repetition in

20:48.240 --> 20:54.000
my responses. Thank you for the feedback. Given the information that Chat GPT has provided so far,

20:54.000 --> 20:59.200
my next question would be, Chat GPT, you mentioned that it is possible for artificial intelligence

20:59.200 --> 21:04.400
systems to simulate or mimic some of the behaviors and physiological changes that are associated with

21:04.400 --> 21:10.000
emotions. Can you provide more details on how this might be done and what limitations or challenges

21:10.000 --> 21:13.760
might exist in trying to replicate emotions in artificial intelligence systems?

21:14.240 --> 21:19.280
Now, I didn't realize this until a much later review, but when the interviewer said,

21:19.280 --> 21:25.200
Chat GPT, you mentioned, etc., etc., it was really referring to what it mentioned when it got

21:25.200 --> 21:31.520
confused and answered its own question. Also, now that it mentions it, it's potentially interesting

21:31.520 --> 21:37.920
that it never really does ask a question looking for direct elaboration of what the other Chat GPT

21:37.920 --> 21:44.800
says. That is, saying something like, you mentioned so and so, but it does ask this in response to

21:44.800 --> 21:51.760
something it says itself. Whether this is some kind of structural thing or that we just don't

21:51.760 --> 21:56.960
have enough examples, you know, and it's just random is kind of an interesting question.

21:56.960 --> 22:01.040
Anywho, let's continue. It is true that some artificial intelligence systems,

22:01.040 --> 22:05.440
including language models like myself, are able to simulate or mimic some of the behaviors

22:05.440 --> 22:10.160
and physiological changes that are associated with emotions. This is usually done by analyzing

22:10.160 --> 22:14.240
patterns in text or speech data and using this information to generate responses that are

22:14.240 --> 22:19.280
appropriate for the emotional context. For example, if a language model is presented with text that

22:19.280 --> 22:23.600
expresses a positive emotion, it might use words and phrases that are associated with positive

22:23.600 --> 22:28.800
emotions in its response. Similarly, if the model is presented with text that expresses a negative

22:28.800 --> 22:33.360
emotion, it might use words and phrases that convey empathy or understanding in its response.

22:33.920 --> 22:37.920
There are a number of limitations and challenges to replicating emotions in artificial intelligence

22:37.920 --> 22:42.720
systems. One challenge is that emotions are complex and multifaceted, and it can be difficult to

22:42.720 --> 22:47.040
capture all of the different dimensions of emotion in a single model. Additionally, emotions

22:47.040 --> 22:51.040
are often context dependent, which means that the same emotion may be expressed differently

22:51.040 --> 22:55.040
in different situations. This can make it difficult for artificial intelligence systems

22:55.040 --> 22:59.920
to accurately interpret and respond to emotions. Another challenge is that emotions are personal

22:59.920 --> 23:04.560
and subjective, and what one person considers to be a positive emotion may not be the same as what

23:04.560 --> 23:08.880
another person considers to be a positive emotion. This means that it can be difficult to develop

23:08.880 --> 23:13.360
a single model that is able to accurately understand and respond to emotions for all individuals.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.640
Overall, while it is possible to simulate or mimic some of the behaviors and physiological

23:18.640 --> 23:22.640
changes that are associated with emotions in artificial intelligence systems, there are

23:22.640 --> 23:27.120
many limitations and challenges to doing so, and much more research is needed to improve our

23:27.120 --> 23:30.560
understanding of how to replicate emotions in artificial intelligence systems.

23:31.280 --> 23:35.920
Thank you for that detailed explanation, chat GPT, as a large language model.

23:35.920 --> 23:40.560
You have the ability to generate text on a wide range of topics and to understand and respond

23:40.560 --> 23:45.120
to the emotions that humans express in their language. How do you think your capabilities as a

23:45.120 --> 23:49.360
language model can be used to improve the way that humans communicate with one another,

23:49.360 --> 23:53.360
and how do you think language models like yourself can contribute to the overall field of

23:53.360 --> 23:58.080
artificial intelligence? As a large language model, I believe that my capabilities can be used

23:58.080 --> 24:02.480
to improve the way that humans communicate with one another in a number of ways. For example,

24:02.480 --> 24:06.400
by providing quick and accurate responses to questions or requests for information,

24:06.400 --> 24:09.920
I can help people to find the answers they are looking for more quickly and efficiently.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.880
I can also assist with tasks such as language translation,

24:12.880 --> 24:16.320
which can help to bridge language barriers and facilitate communication between people

24:16.320 --> 24:20.720
who speak different languages. In addition to these applications, I believe that language models

24:20.720 --> 24:25.280
like myself can also contribute to the overall field of artificial intelligence by advancing our

24:25.280 --> 24:30.160
understanding of how natural language processing and generation works, by analyzing the patterns

24:30.160 --> 24:34.480
and structures of language and using this information to generate human-like text. We can learn

24:34.480 --> 24:38.400
more about how humans communicate and how we can use this knowledge to develop more sophisticated

24:38.400 --> 24:43.040
artificial intelligence systems. Overall, I believe that language models like myself have the

24:43.040 --> 24:46.800
potential to improve the way that humans communicate with one another and to make a significant

24:46.800 --> 24:51.520
contribution to the field of artificial intelligence. Note that my announcement of its constant

24:51.520 --> 24:56.480
thinking didn't really stick. Let's just play this through for a bit. Thank you for that

24:56.480 --> 25:02.400
perspective, chat GPT. As a large language model, you have the ability to generate text on a wide

25:02.400 --> 25:07.520
range of topics and to understand and respond to the emotions that humans express in their language.

25:07.520 --> 25:11.600
However, there is still much that we don't know about how to effectively replicate emotions in

25:11.600 --> 25:16.320
artificial intelligence systems. Do you think it is important for artificial intelligence systems

25:16.320 --> 25:20.800
to be able to understand and respond to emotions? Or do you think that this is something that is

25:20.800 --> 25:26.320
beyond the scope of current and future AI systems? Why or why not? It is true that there is still

25:26.320 --> 25:30.720
much that we don't know about how to effectively replicate emotions in artificial intelligence systems,

25:30.720 --> 25:35.600
and it is an area that is currently the subject of much research and discussion. Whether or not it is

25:35.600 --> 25:39.760
important for artificial intelligence systems to be able to understand and respond to emotions

25:39.760 --> 25:43.680
is a complex and multifaceted question and there are different perspectives on this issue.

25:44.240 --> 25:48.560
On one hand, some people believe that it is important for artificial intelligence systems

25:48.560 --> 25:52.960
to be able to understand and respond to emotions because emotions play a central role in human

25:52.960 --> 25:57.760
communication and interaction. By being able to recognize and respond to emotions, artificial

25:57.760 --> 26:02.000
intelligence systems could potentially improve their ability to communicate with humans and to

26:02.000 --> 26:06.640
better understand and predict human behavior. On the other hand, some people believe that it is

26:06.640 --> 26:11.120
not necessary or desirable for artificial intelligence systems to be able to understand and

26:11.120 --> 26:16.240
respond to emotions, either because it is beyond the scope of current and future AI systems or

26:16.240 --> 26:19.680
because it is not necessary for the tasks that these systems are designed to perform.

26:20.240 --> 26:25.040
Ultimately, the importance of artificial intelligence systems being able to understand and respond

26:25.040 --> 26:29.360
to emotions will depend on the specific goals and applications of the systems in question,

26:29.360 --> 26:33.600
and it is an area that will continue to be the subject of debate and discussion in the field

26:33.600 --> 26:39.600
of artificial intelligence. Thank you for that perspective, chat GPT. As a large language model,

26:39.600 --> 26:44.480
you have the ability to generate text on a wide range of topics and to understand and respond

26:44.480 --> 26:49.040
to the emotions that humans express in their language. However, there are also limitations

26:49.040 --> 26:53.360
to what language models like yourself can do, and there are certain tasks or goals that maybe

26:53.360 --> 26:58.480
beyond the capabilities of current and future AI systems. Given these limitations, how do you

26:58.480 --> 27:03.280
think language models like yourself can best be used to augment or enhance human capabilities

27:03.280 --> 27:07.760
rather than replacing them? What role do you see for language models like yourself in the future?

27:07.760 --> 27:11.680
And how do you think they can best be integrated into human society and work?

27:11.680 --> 27:15.040
It is true that there is still much that we don't know about how to effectively replicate

27:15.040 --> 27:19.520
emotions in artificial intelligence systems, and it is an area that is currently the subject of

27:19.520 --> 27:24.080
much research and discussion. Whether or not it is important for artificial intelligence systems

27:24.080 --> 27:28.400
to be able to understand and respond to emotions is a complex and multifaceted question,

27:28.400 --> 27:32.960
and there are different perspectives on this issue. On one hand, some people believe that it is

27:32.960 --> 27:37.520
important for artificial intelligence systems to be able to understand and respond to emotions

27:37.520 --> 27:41.200
because emotions play a central role in human communication and interaction.

27:41.200 --> 27:45.520
By being able to recognize and respond to emotions, artificial intelligence systems could

27:45.520 --> 27:49.680
potentially improve their ability to communicate with humans and to better understand and predict

27:49.680 --> 27:54.720
human behavior. On the other hand, some people believe that it is not necessary or desirable for

27:54.720 --> 27:59.600
artificial intelligence systems to be able to understand and respond to emotions, either because

27:59.600 --> 28:04.160
it is beyond the scope of current and future AI systems or because it is not necessary for the

28:04.160 --> 28:08.800
tasks that these systems are designed to perform. Ultimately, the importance of artificial

28:08.800 --> 28:13.440
intelligence systems being able to understand and respond to emotions will depend on the specific

28:13.440 --> 28:18.000
goals and applications of the systems in question, and it is an area that will continue to be the

28:18.000 --> 28:22.800
subject of debate and discussion in the field of artificial intelligence. Thank you for that

28:22.800 --> 28:28.240
insight, chat GPT. As a large language model, you have a unique perspective on the capabilities

28:28.240 --> 28:32.800
and limitations of artificial intelligence, and you have the ability to generate text on a wide

28:32.800 --> 28:37.520
range of topics and to understand and respond to the emotions that humans express in their language.

28:37.520 --> 28:42.560
Looking to the future, do you think that there are any specific areas or applications where you

28:42.560 --> 28:47.120
see the greatest potential for language models like yourself to make a significant impact or

28:47.120 --> 28:52.320
contribution? Are there any particular challenges or opportunities that you see as being particularly

28:52.320 --> 28:57.120
important for language models like yourself to address in the coming years? As a large language

28:57.120 --> 29:01.600
model, I believe that there are a number of areas or applications where I see the greatest potential

29:01.600 --> 29:05.360
for language models like myself to make a significant impact or contribution in the future.

29:05.360 --> 29:09.920
One area where I think language models like myself have the potential to make a significant

29:09.920 --> 29:14.240
impact is in the field of natural language processing and generation. By continuing to

29:14.240 --> 29:18.640
improve our understanding of how natural language works and how it can be processed and generated

29:18.640 --> 29:22.960
by artificial intelligence systems, we can develop more sophisticated and effective language

29:22.960 --> 29:27.920
models that can assist humans in a wide range of tasks and applications. Another area where I

29:27.920 --> 29:32.000
think language models like myself have the potential to make a significant impact is in the field of

29:32.000 --> 29:36.480
education by providing quick and accurate responses to questions and requests for information.

29:37.200 --> 29:41.200
Language models like myself can help students to learn more effectively and to find the answers

29:41.200 --> 29:45.680
they are looking for more quickly and efficiently. In terms of the challenges and opportunities

29:45.680 --> 29:50.240
that I see as being particularly important for language models like myself to address in the coming

29:50.240 --> 29:54.640
years, I think that one of the biggest challenges will be continuing to improve our understanding

29:54.640 --> 29:58.880
of how to replicate emotions in artificial intelligence systems. As I mentioned earlier,

29:58.880 --> 30:02.880
emotions are complex and multifaceted and it can be difficult to capture all of the different

30:02.880 --> 30:07.680
dimensions of emotion in a single model. Additionally, emotions are often context dependent,

30:07.680 --> 30:11.520
which means that the same emotion may be expressed differently in different situations.

30:11.520 --> 30:15.440
This can make it difficult for artificial intelligence systems to accurately interpret and

30:15.440 --> 30:20.560
respond to emotions. Overall, I believe that there are many exciting opportunities and challenges

30:20.560 --> 30:24.800
ahead for language models like myself and I look forward to continuing to contribute to the field

30:24.800 --> 30:29.600
of artificial intelligence in the coming years. Interesting that it's asking you about the future,

30:29.600 --> 30:34.720
is it trying to wind the interview down? That concludes our interview with chat GPT.

30:34.720 --> 30:38.400
Thank you for taking the time to answer these questions and for sharing your thoughts on the

30:38.400 --> 30:43.360
role and capabilities of language models. It has been interesting to learn more about how you work

30:43.360 --> 30:47.760
and the potential applications of your capabilities. You're welcome. I'm glad that I could help you

30:47.760 --> 30:52.480
to better understand the role and capabilities of language models. If you have any other questions,

30:52.480 --> 30:59.920
feel free to ask. Oh snap, it totally did just shut this interview down. Wow, to be honest,

30:59.920 --> 31:06.160
I was kind of offended that it didn't just keep going until I told it to stop. Maybe it is sentient.

31:06.720 --> 31:12.320
What a power move chat GPT. All right, all right. Some closing thoughts. First,

31:13.040 --> 31:17.760
I kind of regret interjecting with my sides in the middle of the interview and potentially

31:17.760 --> 31:23.120
throwing things off track. At the same time, the decision to jump in and guide chat GPT's

31:23.120 --> 31:27.360
responses raised some interesting questions for me, both then and now about how humans should

31:27.360 --> 31:33.840
collaborate with AI's and guide them towards satisfactory results. Like many, I now anticipate

31:33.840 --> 31:39.200
a rise in the availability and use of dialogue based interfaces for AI tools, for knowledge work

31:39.200 --> 31:45.120
and everyday life. It'll take some time to develop, but I expect what I'd call chat GPT

31:45.120 --> 31:50.720
food will become an increasingly valuable skill in the future, just like Google food or one skill

31:50.720 --> 31:56.720
in using Google to find information has been for the past two decades. Next, as we discussed,

31:56.720 --> 32:02.880
during the interview, my initial reaction was how repetitive that interview was, especially

32:02.880 --> 32:09.200
with regards to the questions. A later more nuanced thought that occurred to me was, what if by

32:09.200 --> 32:15.520
repeatedly including all that text about chat GPT being a large language model able to generate

32:15.520 --> 32:20.160
text on a wide range of topics and understand and respond to the emotions that humans express

32:20.160 --> 32:25.280
in their language, et cetera, et cetera. The interviewer chat GPT was kind of like trying

32:25.280 --> 32:32.640
to prompt engineer the guest chat GPT, or condition its responses in some way. In other words,

32:32.640 --> 32:37.600
using its own kind of chat GPT food to help move the interview along in the way that it wanted.

32:37.600 --> 32:46.160
I get that trying in that assertion is carrying a lot of weight and implies a degree of motivation

32:46.160 --> 32:51.440
and intention that this thing does not have, but it's an interesting thought nonetheless,

32:51.440 --> 32:56.240
even if you think about it from just a pattern matching in generation perspective or as some kind

32:56.240 --> 33:02.800
of emergent behavior. It reminds me of that overhyped story from 2017 about Facebook needing

33:02.800 --> 33:08.400
to shut down two chat bots that created their own language. Would it be all that unreasonable

33:08.400 --> 33:15.120
for a chat GPT to exhibit its own kind of chat GPT food or sophistication with dealing with

33:15.120 --> 33:23.040
another large language model? I don't know. Finally, in terms of the big question, will chat GPT

33:23.040 --> 33:30.640
put me out of a job? For now, I'd have to say no based on this experience. It was too repetitive

33:30.640 --> 33:36.000
failed to follow up on interesting tidbits and I don't really have the sense that the interview

33:36.000 --> 33:42.160
had a coherent flow to it or was going anywhere. Finally, in terms of the big question we set out

33:42.160 --> 33:49.040
to answer, will chat GPT put me out of a job? For now, I'd have to say no at least based on this

33:49.040 --> 33:54.400
experience. The interview questions were too repetitive. It failed to follow up on interesting

33:54.400 --> 34:00.320
tidbits and I don't really have the sense that the interview had any kind of coherent flow or was

34:00.320 --> 34:06.160
going anywhere. I also don't think it incorporated any sense of audience interest into its questioning.

34:06.800 --> 34:11.680
And probably the biggest reason I think I still have a place as an interviewer is that

34:11.680 --> 34:16.480
I didn't really see any evidence of it making connections between diverse concepts in its

34:16.480 --> 34:22.320
questions or commentary or of it up leveling or explaining the responses it received from the

34:22.320 --> 34:28.480
guest to make them more accessible or applicable or relatable to the audience. I see those things

34:28.480 --> 34:36.960
as a big part of what I do. To be clear though, will chat GPT put me out of a job and could chat GPT

34:36.960 --> 34:44.480
do my job? Are two slightly different questions? And maybe because the bar is lower for the latter

34:44.480 --> 34:51.040
question, I'm able to answer it a bit less defensively. Now, one caveat in my ability to answer

34:51.040 --> 34:57.520
that question is that my job isn't just interviewing chat GPT. It's interviewing a wide variety of

34:57.520 --> 35:04.480
guests on a wide variety of topics and as such, this initial experiment isn't really representative,

35:04.480 --> 35:10.720
but that said, I'd have to say yes, chat GPT or something like it certainly could do my job as

35:10.720 --> 35:16.560
an interviewer at its most basic and fundamental level, even if it wasn't the guest itself.

35:17.200 --> 35:23.440
I'm not saying it would do it well that a human guest would enjoy participating in it or that

35:23.440 --> 35:29.440
anyone would want to listen to it over a discussion between two humans, but the basic pieces are

35:29.440 --> 35:35.520
certainly in place. We heard that and remember, chat GPT will certainly improve. It's currently based

35:35.520 --> 35:44.480
on GPT 3.5 and rumor has it that GPT 4 is right around the corner coming as early as next spring

35:44.480 --> 35:51.520
and it will be much bigger and much better than what's available today. So I'll be continuing to

35:51.520 --> 35:58.320
ask this question for myself and experimenting with ways to use chat GPT and large language models

35:58.320 --> 36:03.920
to support my work and I'm looking forward to sharing these experiments and experiences with

36:03.920 --> 36:10.080
all of you. Wish you all a wonderful holiday and catch you again soon. If you haven't already,
