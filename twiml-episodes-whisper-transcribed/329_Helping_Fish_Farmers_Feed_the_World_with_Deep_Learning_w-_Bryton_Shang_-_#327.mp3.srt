00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,400
Welcome to the Tumel AI Podcast.

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,400
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:24,480
Hey, what's up everyone?

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,920
I recently attended the AWS Reinvent Conference in Las Vegas, and I'm excited to share

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:38,720
a few of my many interesting conversations from that event here on the podcast this week.

6
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:44,160
Before we dive in, I'd like to thank our friends at Capital One for sponsoring our Reinvent

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,760
series.

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,120
Capital One has been a huge friend and supporter of this podcast for some time now, and

9
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,600
I'm looking forward to sharing my interview with Dave Castillo, Capital One's managing

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,640
VP of Machine Learning with you on Thursday.

11
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,400
Dave and I discussed the unique approach being taken at the company's Center for Machine

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:07,480
Learning, as well as some of the interesting AI use cases being developed at the bank,

13
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:12,080
and the platform they're building to support their ML and AI efforts.

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,880
Once again, check back in on Thursday, December 19th for that conversation.

And now on to the show.

18
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:36,760
All right, everyone, I am on the line with Brighton Shang.

19
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,720
Brighton is the founder and CEO at AquaBite.

20
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,760
Brighton, welcome to the Twil AI podcast.

21
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Yeah.

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,760
Thank you.

23
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
Great to be here.

24
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
Awesome.

25
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:51,440
So you just spoke at the Reinvent Machine Learning Summit earlier this week on a really

26
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,080
interesting topic, and one that we have not covered on the podcast before.

27
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:01,000
The application of deep learning to fish farming, essentially.

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,680
I'm really interested in diving into the topic, but how did you get started working in

29
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:07,680
this area?

30
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,800
Yeah, it's a bit of an unusual story.

31
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,000
So for context, the company AquaBite, we build software for fish farms.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,480
And it's a camera-based software, so the camera goes in the fish pen.

33
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,680
It takes pictures of the fish.

34
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,520
And then using computer vision and machine learning algorithms, we process those images

35
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:33,680
to be able to determine things such as the weight of the fish, the health of the fish,

36
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,080
how hungry the fish is, and then ultimately the farming buys us as a subscription service.

37
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:45,400
And so it's this idea of bringing machine learning and computer vision, which is very

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,800
well-understood in other industries and bringing it to fish farming.

39
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,320
Now, the whole idea, I mean, so I grew up in Ithaca, New York, actually right by Cornell,

40
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,080
and one of our family friends was a professor of Occupial through there.

41
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,400
Then I ended up going to Princeton.

42
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,160
I studied operations research and financial engineering, which is basically like data science

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,160
and machine learning.

44
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:12,280
And then after that, pretty much since university, I've been starting various companies.

45
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,240
I started an algorithmic trading firm, also was a CTO of another company that was doing

46
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:23,520
deep learning for cancer detection, and then 2017, I started Occupial and the idea was

47
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,400
to bring the same machine learning and computer vision technologies to fish farming.

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,400
And for those who fish farming, maybe not as well known in the US, but actually is the

49
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,440
main way we get fish, like over half of the fish we consume is farmed.

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,280
It's not grown in the ocean.

51
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,160
And so the idea of being these fish, imagine they grow in these massive pens, we don't

52
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,960
really know how they grow.

53
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,640
We don't know how much to feed them.

54
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,280
We don't know a lot of things, and so be able to bring basic insight to the farmers using

55
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:04,440
computer vision machine learning is really like a game changer for them.

56
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,720
And I can share more about the progression of the company and how we progress.

57
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,520
But now we're selling to these salmon farmers in Norway that are using it to count sea

58
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,560
lice, estimate the weight of their fish.

59
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,880
Most of our engineering teams in San Francisco, but we actually start selling with the salmon

60
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,480
farms in Norway, because 99% of the industries that are national.

61
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,400
Well, how did you identify the opportunity?

62
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,080
Was it serendipity?

63
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:37,880
You met someone who was interested in or working in aquaculture and you recognized the opportunity

64
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:45,120
through those conversations, or were you actively searching for places to apply ML and AI,

65
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,800
and you came across this particular opportunity?

66
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,240
Well, generally, I've been working in the space in different companies, and conceptually

67
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,520
I had an idea of, well, to be able to process images and to be able to use that to deliver

68
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:04,160
some insight, that paradigm, the idea for fish farming.

69
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,120
So I mentioned that I grew by Cornell, but also my old co-founder, one of his classmates

70
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,200
had owned a fish farm, and I had heard about it from him.

71
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,320
And then kind of one thing led to another.

72
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:22,200
I was reading papers on how they were using camera-sized fish and then ended up at the time

73
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,000
incubating this out of a venture capital firm.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,440
So they had given me some money with the idea of me coming up with a new machine learning

75
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,480
powered startup, and this is one of the ideas I looked into, and then one thing led to

76
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:38,800
another and then built out a simple prototype and then raised some capital.

77
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,740
So it was a bit of serendipity, but it was also the experience of having worked in these

78
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,520
other industries and seeing the parallels between, I mean, even something as foreign

79
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,800
as like algorithmic trading, it's conceptually similar because you're processing data in

80
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,320
real time that's coming in, and instead of deciding whether to buy or sell stocks, you're

81
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,840
just deciding how much to feed your fish or what action to take.

82
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,320
And so conceptually, these mental models are applicable between different industries.

83
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,880
And so you mentioned talking a little bit more about the evolution of the company.

84
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,640
Where did you start once you identified the problem?

85
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,840
So I started by building a simple prototype.

86
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,840
Okay.

87
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,800
So I actually talked about this at the ML Summit, but I started literally in my apartment

88
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,800
bathtub, so I built a simple rig, filled the bathtub with water, got some robotic fish

89
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
off of Amazon.

90
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,800
I was going to say, did you load some salmon into your bathtub?

91
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Yeah, exactly.

92
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
Yeah.

93
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,080
I don't know if it would fit, but yeah, certainly like these tiny robotic fish that would swim

94
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,520
around, and it works like the camera could actually determine the length of the robotic

95
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,400
fish, and the proportions of the fish correlate to the weight.

96
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,640
It's just something that biologists know, and so then kind of that the concept was proven,

97
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,200
and then the idea was, okay, now I need to go from my bathtub to the ocean, where it's

98
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,400
rough conditions, where it's limited connectivity, where it's not just these robotic fish, but

99
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,520
you have live fish with behavior, minds of their own, different environmental conditions,

100
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:24,800
and a lot of practical concerns, and that was really kind of 27, 2018 was building the

101
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,760
first prototypes for the ocean, getting a camera there, actually finding the fish farmers,

102
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:36,040
so I don't know how many folks in the U.S. know fish farmers, but like again 99% outside

103
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,960
the U.S., and so imagine me and Silicon Valley, but going to Norway to talk to these fish

104
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,440
farmers, find them, convince them that this is like the next idea, and then start working

105
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,400
with them, and so actually ended up living in Norway for a number of months, and certainly

106
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,600
traveling back and forth since then.

107
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Wow, wow.

108
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:05,720
Yeah, I've seen some fish farms in Asia, and what I remember of them, particularly when

109
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:14,000
the fish are being fed, and this may be the anomaly, but it was just chaos, it wasn't

110
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,800
like a few robotic fish in a bathtub, the density per square meter of fish or of ocean was

111
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:31,200
very, very high, it strikes me as a very challenging environment to do computer vision.

112
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,960
I think it is quite challenging.

113
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,720
I think it also depends on what type of fish are going in which environment to take an

114
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:45,080
example in Norway by law, they cannot have more than two and a half percent of their pen

115
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,080
be fish.

116
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
Oh, wow.

117
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
Okay.

118
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:55,000
So actually it's like, it is quite a lot of fish, but it's not super packed, and so it's

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,280
not like your fish are blocking your camera, but it is a very chaotic environment.

120
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:08,680
Going back to the bathtub, you found some success in kind of estimating the weight

121
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:17,200
of your robotic fish, maybe talk a little bit more about the kind of the process or the

122
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:24,320
challenges there, for example, even measuring the length of a fish without knowing its distance

123
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,520
from the camera, if you're just using the camera, like how do you overcome those kinds

124
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
of issues?

125
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,520
Right.

126
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,520
Right.

127
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,200
So if you look at our website, we have a picture of the camera.

128
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,360
It's a stereo camera, so with stereo, kind of two parallel lenses, we can send depth

129
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,960
using the disparity in the two images.

130
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,960
Oh, okay.

131
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:53,080
Now, it's a fairly straightforward geometric calculation to figure out.

132
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,520
Kind of if I see the pixel on one image and the pixel on the other image, I can calculate

133
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,000
the disparity and then use that to get the depth and then the three position and therefore

134
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,160
calculate the length and so on and so forth.

135
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,600
Now, conceptually, this makes, it's fairly straightforward.

136
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,000
Now, in practice, you're dealing with a number of challenges, I'll just highlight a couple

137
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,080
for one, optics are slightly different in water.

138
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,680
Water you're dealing with light scattering, turbidity, essentially particles in the water

139
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,360
that your photons, by the time they're hitting your lens, they're a bit distorted or they

140
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,080
got to, they bounce off of different particles and so to be able to get a very precise estimate

141
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,240
is more difficult underwater.

142
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:46,280
Also fish are shiny, they're reflective, they're very specular and so to be able to get

143
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:52,600
good detail of that specific scale on one image versus another image and get the distance,

144
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,040
it's actually quite challenging versus something that's more textured or that you can actually

145
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,640
discern a lot of detail.

146
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,640
These fish underwater, I mean the scales look the same, so it's a bit more challenging.

147
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,080
Also for those who've worked with camera-based systems, you need to calibrate them and

148
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,280
the calibration can be a bit sensitive and so there's a number of steps and practical

149
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:22,440
challenges that you need to work with from resolution to turbidity to calibration to

150
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:30,040
specularity, the object to lighting and a lot of this was us actually going out to the

151
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:35,120
field, dropping a camera in the water, doing a lot of experimentation because a lot of

152
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,040
this stuff you can calculate at a theoretical level but until you put the camera in the

153
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,240
water and actually image the fish, you don't know if it's going to work or not and then

154
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,880
compound that with this being at actual fish farm which is in the middle of the ocean,

155
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:57,720
limited connectivity, literally like you got to take a boat to get out there and so it's

156
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,240
not as easy as taking your autonomous vehicle and driving it around town to get data.

157
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:10,600
You need to really go through a lot of practical challenges, get on a boat, go to Norway to

158
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:16,840
actually do this type of research but once you do it then we get the data, we're able

159
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,440
to analyze it and actually deductively come to the best system.

160
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,760
As far as we've talked about deterministic approaches, geometry and optics and things

161
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,840
like that, where do machine learning and deep learning come into play?

162
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:37,520
It's in the perception so for example, let's just take the example of we want to figure

163
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,360
out the weight of a single fish.

164
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:47,800
We know from the biologist that if I get the length then I can calculate the weight

165
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,960
because like humans, the fish grow in proportions and so you can get that.

166
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,800
Now the actual detection of these points on the fish, you can imagine if we're doing this

167
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,680
for thousands and thousands of fish a day, we're not going to just want people to identify

168
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
the points.

169
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,800
This is where the computer vision comes in where we have algorithms that can automatically

170
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,760
detect key points on the fish and be able to then use that as inputs into the geometry

171
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:25,160
to get the lengths and the fish weight and that those are essentially deep learning, convolutional

172
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,600
neural net based algorithms that can do detection of different key points and be able to do

173
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,600
other things.

174
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,640
Something we'll talk a bit about later is we determine the health of the fish, it's not

175
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:42,880
just the weight, it's also the health of the fish, particles in the water, food.

176
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,880
I don't want to spoil too much of the other applications we'll talk about them later but

177
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:53,440
you can use computer vision as a lot of the perception input to these downstream algorithms

178
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,240
and we are using some supervised algorithms to be able to do things such as determine

179
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,000
the fish weight.

180
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,160
Before we leave the weight, one aspect of this that strikes me as a bit counterintuitive

181
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:14,240
when I think of a human's length or height and their weight, there's certainly a correlation

182
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:21,120
but I would think of our height as more correlated to age and our weight can kind of vary around

183
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:30,200
some midpoint pretty dramatically but that our height obviously doesn't change accordingly.

184
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,600
We don't grow a few inches after Thanksgiving and then take those few inches off, vertical

185
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,600
inches at least.

186
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:42,400
But what I'm here for you is that you're inferring the weight largely on the length of the

187
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
fish.

188
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:50,200
So to your point, we are detecting a number of different points on the fish so it's not

189
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:55,480
just the length, it's the width, it's like the eye to the fin to all these different points

190
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,720
on the fish that then end up forming a 3D model of the fish to get the weight.

191
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,720
Got it.

192
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:07,880
You talked a little bit about the relative density of the fish in the farm.

193
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:16,280
Are you using your perception models to try to create bounding boxes around multiple

194
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,720
fish in an image or are you throwing out images that have multiple fish?

195
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:28,400
Most of your images have single fish and how resilient are your models to the orientation

196
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
of the fish?

197
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,560
Are you trying to catch the fish at just the right moment?

198
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,960
I would say all of the above.

199
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:45,000
So if you look at one of the underwater fish image pictures, so I have one in the presentation

200
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,560
I was showing each one of these images has like 50 to 100 fish.

201
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Okay.

202
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,960
So there's like a massive amount of fish and as you pointed out, the fish is in every

203
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,960
which direction.

204
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,920
I mean, the fish generally, they school together.

205
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,960
So if you put it parallel to the school of fish, you can get a nice side view.

206
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,360
But there are some fish that are like facing the camera away from the camera or not in

207
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:15,480
the right orientation or there's too much light or they're too dark or whatever the water

208
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,560
is too blurry and so the fish is too blurry.

209
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:27,080
And so there needs to be some type of process by which we can filter the images and make

210
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,400
sure we're getting the best fish to be analyzed.

211
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,960
And that's really more an art than a science where that's where you're tweaking your

212
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,120
hyperparameters to figure out what's the best trade-off between essentially precision

213
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,080
and recall of a fish detector, a clear of a clear fish.

214
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,360
And so whether you want more or less fish and then if you want more fish, then it's

215
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,400
less, the more the fish are less clear.

216
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,840
But then you kind of figure out what's the optimal trade-off to get you the best result.

217
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:04,400
Then is the idea that if you're capturing kind of the, again, kind of sticking to weight

218
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,880
and maybe this extends to health and some of the other things you're measuring.

219
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:14,920
But is the idea that you are essentially computing some kind of average weight of all the

220
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:23,400
fish or is it more trying to identify individual fish and track individual fishes weight or anything

221
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
like that?

222
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:30,480
Yes, so that's actually one of the more cool applications we're working on is fish facial

223
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,080
recognition.

224
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,240
As it turns out, the spots on the fish's face are unique.

225
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,960
And so you can use it like a fingerprint to be able to uniquely identify that fish.

226
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,640
So you can imagine what one of the questions you might ask, okay, how do you know if I

227
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,600
saw the same fish twice, like how do I know if it's swam by the camera twice?

228
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,920
So you can know from this individual fish recognition.

229
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:00,920
And so we are using that to track individual fish over time and then there's some other

230
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:07,080
interesting implications where you can use it, for example, in breeding to be able to find

231
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,560
the best male, the best female fish and breathe them together and to be able to do a lot

232
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:17,520
more detailed analyses if you can know not just at a population level but also at an individual

233
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,240
level how they're growing.

234
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,600
And so we are working along on a lot of these other applications that are improving our

235
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,000
weight estimation model, for example.

236
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,400
Okay, that's awesome.

237
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:37,760
Yeah, one of our most popular shows from last year was with Jason Holmberg who is the

238
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:45,520
head of engineering or was at the time at Wildme, which was applying kind of similar types

239
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,280
of approaches to identifying, uniquely identifying humpback whales.

240
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:57,040
And he's the same kind of fingerprint analogy based on their patterns and markings.

241
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,840
Wow, that's pretty cool.

242
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:07,880
Yeah, I know that there are, I mean, even WACV 2020, they're holding a specific section

243
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:10,000
on animal re-identification.

244
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,480
So I know there's, even like specific conferences that are focusing on this.

245
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:22,960
And so you are, you know, maybe back to kind of the fundamental use case, you describe

246
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,960
this.

247
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:29,640
I forget what you said, 6,000, I forget if that was like images per day or fish per day

248
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,640
or something like that.

249
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,360
But the picture that you've created for me is that you've got this online real time

250
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:43,600
application that's constantly taking pictures of fish and, you know, identifying their weight

251
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,560
and health and hunger levels, things like that.

252
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,320
And what I guess one of my fundamental questions is like, do we need to know the real time

253
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,040
health of the fish like with, where does it, you know, I imagine that before that someone

254
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:02,480
would like to take a boat out to the pen, you know, once a week and sample a few fish

255
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,600
and kind of get a sense for how they were doing, you know, where does that fall short?

256
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:14,320
Well, so to give you a sense, let's, let's take a typical salmon pen in Norway.

257
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,600
It's about half a football field in Damien or you could submerge an entire 737 in the

258
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
pen.

259
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,200
These are like massive pens.

260
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,240
The single pen has anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 fish.

261
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,240
Okay.

262
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,120
So you're not going to get a representative sample if you just take a sample of even 100

263
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,880
fish, you need to get some representative part of the population.

264
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,960
Now combine that with the other fact that these fish, they're growing one to two percent

265
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,480
every day, just be like of their own body weight at the eats.

266
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,480
Okay.

267
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,480
So they're going pretty quickly.

268
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:56,880
And so you want to be able to sample enough every day such that you get an accurate weight

269
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,360
and also see a represented enough population.

270
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,360
Okay.

271
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,800
So, I mean, for, and the other thing is for us, again, because these farms were in the

272
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:12,480
middle of the ocean, it's not like we're sending these images back to the cloud to get

273
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
processed.

274
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,080
It's just like too much data.

275
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:22,440
And so the trade off of processing more images is just computing power and because it

276
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:26,440
is local at the farm, the computing happens for free.

277
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,400
So we're, we would like to process as many fish as we can.

278
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,560
I'm interested in exploring that the form factor of your computing system a little bit.

279
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:43,080
Do you have like a floating data center that is doing a floating kind of inference engine?

280
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,600
It's all on camera.

281
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:53,440
So if you look at our camera, it has the lenses, the camera sensor, there's also a computer

282
00:21:53,440 --> 00:22:00,320
onboard microprocessor that's processing the images on inside the camera and underwater

283
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,320
camera.

284
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:08,200
So we're doing all of that compute there and then it attaches to whatever switch or power

285
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,320
it has and then, and then they can see all the information coming off the camera.

286
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
Got it.

287
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,240
And for one of these typical pens, how many cameras are located there?

288
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,800
It's a single camera that navigates around the pen.

289
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Okay.

290
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:28,040
And navigates like around the edges or like some kind of autonomous thing or a Roomba fish

291
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,040
counter camera.

292
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:36,280
So it could be typically, so the cameras and fish pens are not new things.

293
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,440
They actually already have them for monitoring feeding of the fish.

294
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,080
So they typically have cameras on winches.

295
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:49,720
So they're essentially on rope and police systems that they, they move throughout the pen.

296
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
Okay.

297
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
So it is moving.

298
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,880
And then how you want to sample that is, is a more complicated question, but could

299
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,880
be autonomous if the farmer wants that.

300
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,160
But a lot of times the farmer doesn't want like autonomous moving thing.

301
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:09,160
They want to be able to like, because it becomes a liability if it can like move in and

302
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,440
hit things or whatever.

303
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:18,400
So you mentioned some of the other use cases beyond the weight.

304
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
One of them being counting sea lice.

305
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,200
What's that one about?

306
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:28,680
So sea lice is this parasite, it's a naturally occurring parasite that attaches to the fish.

307
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,920
It weakens in the immune system and eventually kills the fish.

308
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,680
In Norway, for example, it's about 25% of the costs of running the farm.

309
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:42,680
Now these farms, they need to count sea lice as a part of the legally running a farm.

310
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:48,560
Because essentially their version of the FDA nor requires them to sample sea lice every

311
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,080
week from all their pens.

312
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,280
So the typical process is fairly tedious.

313
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:57,600
So you've got to send someone out to the pen, they're netting some fish, then they

314
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,640
anesthetize each fish and then count the sea lice by hand and they have to do this week

315
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,400
over week over week.

316
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:10,040
Now the idea, we can make this process a lot simpler for farmers with the same camera footage,

317
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,840
be able to identify the sea lice on the fish and then be able to quantify this into a

318
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,560
system that then the farmers could use to manage sea lice infestations.

319
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,520
Now the cool thing is actually in Norway, we are the first company and I think so the

320
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,640
only company where you can apply to have our technology as a replacement for manual counting.

321
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,160
And this is saving the farmers a lot of effort in terms of being able to count the sea lice

322
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,600
and get accurate counts.

323
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,280
You mentioned that 25% of the cost of running the farm is dealing with this sea lice issue.

324
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:49,320
Is that 25% does that come from the cost of doing the sampling and all that or is that

325
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,360
25% of your fish die will cause of sea lice?

326
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,160
Oh, well, it's a combination of mortality.

327
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:01,040
So the fish die from the sea lice but also from the treatments to the fish.

328
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,360
They treat the fish for sea lice and it's a very stressful process.

329
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:11,560
Essentially, it's like a large washing machine that the fish need to go into to get rid

330
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,000
of the sea lice.

331
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,480
So this is a very stressful process, kills the fish.

332
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,640
So the fish, when they're disease, well, they're just like weaker and they eat less and

333
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,320
they're more susceptible.

334
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:32,040
So it's a really challenging problem and it's mandated by law because if the infestations

335
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:39,040
get too high, then they start to infect the wild fish and that's that that cannot happen.

336
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:44,840
And so they need to keep the sea lice levels low and if the infestations increase, then

337
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,840
they need to treat it, which is stressful, kills more fish and the treatments themselves

338
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,320
are quite expensive.

339
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,920
So overall, it's a very, very challenging thing to manage and especially because they

340
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,600
don't actually know the true state of the infestation.

341
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,840
So what the farmers are doing is because they have the more accurate numbers, they can

342
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,920
then forecast infestation levels and then figure out the optimal time to treat the fish

343
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:14,800
and ultimately reduce the number of treatments and improve the overall welfare of the fish.

344
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,800
And are those models that you're developing and providing for the farmers or the farmers

345
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:26,400
already have ways to project the intensity of infestations?

346
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,760
They have rudimentary models but we're providing a lot more sophisticated models to them to

347
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,280
be able to forecast the infestation patterns.

348
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,280
Cool.

349
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:47,440
Going back to the computer vision elements of this, how would you describe the general

350
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,960
approach or models that you're using?

351
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,880
And I'm curious about things like to what degree are you able to take off the shelf computer

352
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,560
vision models, trained on things like image net for example and apply transfer learning

353
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:10,560
or are you basically starting from scratch with known models or are you kind of inventing

354
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:19,400
your own things like how complex are the models that you're fielding to solve these problems?

355
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:26,120
We were able to transfer learn as you mentioned a pre-trained model and train it specifically

356
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,200
to identify fish.

357
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:35,680
And then you kind of want to go, so previous in the show you had mentioned, well, kind of

358
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:39,560
what if the fish is in the wrong orientation or if it's super area, it's too dark and

359
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,440
you want to start tuning your model to those nuances.

360
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:51,040
And that's where when we detect the fish, if the detector has a low confidence, we can

361
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,400
annotate those examples with low confidence to be able to improve the model.

362
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,080
And so we have done annotation to be able to improve the model and the transfer learning

363
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,040
techniques have worked well for us to be able to, for example, fish detection.

364
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,400
Now that's a relatively simple model.

365
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,280
Now let's talk about more complicated models.

366
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:20,080
So for example, let's just say I want to detect the different points on a fish.

367
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:27,960
And so first thing you might try is to be able to do a segmentation of the fish.

368
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,160
So like you get an outline of the fish and then figure out a depth mapping of the fish

369
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,440
so every single point what is the distance and then overlay that to get a 3D model.

370
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:45,920
Now that works, but then you run into like more complicated problem in terms of fish orientation

371
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:52,280
and you're only maybe seeing like half of the fish and then maybe it's hard to explain,

372
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,080
but sometimes the fish is not clear and you're not getting a good mapping.

373
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:03,880
And so it's then starting to do some filtering and and tuning of the model to make sure that

374
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,120
it can work in all these different edge cases.

375
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:18,400
I think another thing that has been an inspiration is let's just say that you want to look at different

376
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,600
poses of the fish.

377
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,040
So maybe the fish is straight, maybe it's curved and you can use those like pose estimation

378
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:33,760
techniques to be able to determine the orientation of your fish and consequently use that to inform

379
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,680
which type of fish you're accepting and what type of weight model to use.

380
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,600
So it can get like fairly fairly complicated.

381
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:51,560
I think the computer vision honestly is maybe like 5 to 10% of it.

382
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,800
Like 90 to 95% of it is the type of data you're collecting.

383
00:29:55,800 --> 00:30:03,080
And so we made a massive investment in terms of establishing over half our team in Norway.

384
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,640
And that's because you can't have a team of computer vision engineers, machine learning

385
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,000
engineers in San Francisco just getting a clean data set like to train the model.

386
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,920
A lot of it is like practically going at the farms, collecting the data, getting the

387
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:26,000
right type of data and getting it annotated and that is just like the devils in the details

388
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,120
about like actually getting and actually physically going out and do the work.

389
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,560
And that is like 90, 95% of it.

390
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,640
Once the data is in a good state, then it's relatively straight forward to train your

391
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
model.

392
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,400
And what's been your approach to annotation?

393
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:48,720
Do you do that in-house or do you do something like a mechanical Turk or something in between

394
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,360
where it's a little bit more curated to your particular use case?

395
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,160
So it depends.

396
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,720
Some of the annotations we do are more general.

397
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:03,200
So identify the fish, that's not that specialized.

398
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,160
Now when you're identifying a sea-lice and I want you to differentiate it into the eight

399
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:14,880
different stages of sea-lice, which are millimeters in size, well that requires some special marine

400
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,520
biology background.

401
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:23,640
And so we work with marine biology, marine biologists in Norway to help us identify the sea

402
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:31,200
ice, but for the simpler stuff like fish, we're able to outsource those annotations to services

403
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,960
as he mentions.

404
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:43,320
So you describe the key challenges being the type of data that you're able to produce.

405
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:48,880
What's the nuance around type, or if there is one, is it, it sounds like it's not just

406
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,560
the volume of data, there's the annotations, of course, and the quality of those annotations.

407
00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Are there other aspects, qualitative aspects of the data collection that have been important

408
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,600
to your ability to solve this problem?

409
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,960
Or am I reading too much into that?

410
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:15,120
I think, and it's like, it's all sorts of things that you wouldn't expect.

411
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:21,360
It's like, for example, there's a bunch of metadata that's quite interesting.

412
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,880
Like does the breed of the fish matter in terms of your weight model?

413
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,680
Like maybe different breeds have different morphologies, have different weights.

414
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:38,320
Does the type of environment and environmental conditions affect your model?

415
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,840
There's a bunch of different other types of metadata and confounding factors that could

416
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,800
affect your ultimate model.

417
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:55,200
And so being able to test it in a wide variety of conditions is also a key part of solving

418
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,720
the problem.

419
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,840
And I think that is really the secret sauce in all of this is that we just like spent

420
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,440
two years banging our heads against the wall in terms of trying out every single condition

421
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,600
and drilling down into even the most minute factors to understand all the different variables

422
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:22,320
that might affect the problem and investigating it because chances are, it's all, again,

423
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,320
all the above.

424
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:30,480
Yes, the breed affects the way the fish, the time of year affects the way of the fish,

425
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:37,520
because well, the time of year affects the runoff to the oceans and the runoff affects

426
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:43,880
the turbidity under water and the turbidity under water affects what size of the fish you

427
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,880
can see and therefore it affects the weight.

428
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,520
And it's things like that that you would have never imagined the cascading effects and

429
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:58,040
to be able to investigate all those effects to figure out and again, this is not going

430
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,680
to be figured out by a computer scientist, machine learning scientist in San Francisco.

431
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:08,280
This is talking to tons of actual fish farmers in Norway and fish biologists who actually

432
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,840
know this stuff and can say, oh, well, that's probably why the reason why the model is

433
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
not working.

434
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,640
And so that's the type of qualitative insight that's invaluable.

435
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:27,120
How readily would you expect or have you seen the models that you've developed for the

436
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:33,200
Norwegian fish farms to translate to a fish farm in Asia, for example?

437
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,520
I think, well, I would say like, within a species, it's fairly transferable because the

438
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,560
water's the water and the fish are fish.

439
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,440
So actually, we we have our model that estimates for salmon.

440
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,920
It actually just worked out of the box for trout.

441
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:56,680
Now when you start going to Asia, Asia, they're growing fish and ponds and the ponds are

442
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,040
well, they're muddy and you can't really see the fish that well.

443
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,280
And so they're maybe optics is not the best solution.

444
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,560
Maybe you want some type of acoustic device, but it's really more conditioned.

445
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,160
It's really more dependent on the type of fish and the condition it's grown in.

446
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,760
But if you're going just like from the same species, from one geography to the other,

447
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,240
I don't think there's as much difference.

448
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:27,920
Of the many different use cases that you've mentioned, you know, weight, health, hunger,

449
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,640
we talked about, you know, sea likes, these are all the ones that we talked about and you

450
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,760
suggested that there are others.

451
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,120
And I'm wondering, you know, before we close out, are there others that are worth mentioning

452
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,520
because they introduce different types of techniques or approaches that you've had to

453
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,520
work with?

454
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,520
Yes.

455
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:50,040
So the holy grail of fish farming is a fully autonomous fish farm.

456
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,040
I'll explain the reason why.

457
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:58,520
So right now, the way fish farms are run is that you need people to go there.

458
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:02,760
So that's why you look at most of the fish farms, they're along the coastline.

459
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:08,200
They're in places like Norway, in places like Chile, where they have long coastline.

460
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:14,760
Now just at a macro macro level, like the earth is 70% water, we only produce about 5%

461
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,640
of the world's protein from the oceans.

462
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,440
So there's a massive potential there, but it requires us to have fully autonomous fish

463
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,320
farms that can be in the deep ocean or that can be on land and that requires a lot more

464
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,800
automation.

465
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,160
Now, the weight estimation, for the first time the farmer can understand the growth of

466
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,800
the fish and use that to benchmark the feeding of the fish.

467
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Now feeding is about half of the cost of running a farm.

468
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:48,680
If you can start to optimize the feeding, essentially by running lots of AB tests to be

469
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:55,320
able to optimize the feeding and create an optimal feeding policy, that is the real holy

470
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,240
grail of fish farming.

471
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,000
Now the way you do that, there's biological models you can use for feeding.

472
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,920
You can also think of other machine learning based model, for example, reinforcement based

473
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,360
learning model, where you learn the policy that is the best for optimally feeding the

474
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
fish.

475
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,560
And I think that, for us, is like a really, really motivating factor and one of the really,
