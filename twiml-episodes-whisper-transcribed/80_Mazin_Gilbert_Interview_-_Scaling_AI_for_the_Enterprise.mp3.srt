00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,880
people doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,480
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,640
This week on the podcast we're running a series of shows consisting of conversations

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,400
with some of the impressive speakers from an event called the AI Summit in New York City.

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:38,840
The theme of that event and of this series is AI in the Enterprise and I think you'll

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,800
find this series really interesting in that it includes a mix of both technical and case

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,880
study oriented discussions.

9
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:51,840
Now I won't actually be attending the AI Summit this week because I'm in Long Beach

10
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,840
California attending the Nips Conference.

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,000
There are a bunch of Twimble listeners here and I'm hoping to meet as many of you as possible.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,300
And yes, I have stickers.

13
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,600
If you're here at Nips and you're actually listening to podcasts this week, please

14
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,600
reach out to me either via the event app, the Nips event app where there's a Twimble

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,240
listeners thread or via Twitter where my handle is at Sam Charrington.

16
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,400
Before we proceed, let's quickly talk about the podcast schedule through the end of the

17
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,400
year.

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,360
Prior to my newsletter, you know that I've been on the road for a couple of weeks now.

19
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,080
After this week's series, we've got two more series coming before we break for the year

20
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,560
with our last show running on December 22nd.

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,960
Now, if you're lamenting two weeks without your favorite machine learning and AI podcast,

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:42,960
trust me with these two series.

23
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,600
The first from the Amazon Web Services Reinvent Conference and the next one from Nips.

24
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,640
You will have plenty of great content to tide you over until we get started again on January

25
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,960
8th.

26
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,280
Thanks to you, 2017 was a great year for the podcast and we plan to close it out strong.

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,840
So keep your ears open the next few weeks and we hope to hear from you.

28
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,720
Please note that on Wednesday, December 13th, we'll be holding our last Twimble Online

29
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,080
Meetup of the Year.

30
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,560
Bring your thoughts on the top machine learning and AI stories of 2017 for our discussion

31
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,840
segment.

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,960
And for our main presentation, Bruno Gensalvez, we'll be presenting the paper Understanding

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Deep Learning requires rethinking generalization by Shi Yuanjiang from MIT and Google Brain and

34
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,280
others.

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,440
You can find more details and register for the meetup at twimlai.com slash meetup.

36
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,680
This AI Summit series is brought to you by our friends at IBM Power Systems.

37
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,280
IBM Power Systems offers servers designed for mission critical applications and emerging

38
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,360
workloads, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, advanced

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,600
analytics, and high performance computing.

40
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:04,000
IBM Power Systems benefit from a wide range of open technologies, many stemming from

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,080
collaboration with fellow Open Power Foundation members, and they're designed to deliver

42
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,800
performance efficiently, whether deployed in private, public, or hybrid clouds.

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:23,400

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,360
Continuing with last show's theme of platforms for Enterprise AI, my guess this time around

46
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,360
is Mazen Gilbert, Vice President of Advanced Technology and Architecture with AT&T.

47
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,960
Mazen and I have a really interesting discussion on what's required to scale AI in the Enterprise,

48
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:48,360
and you'll learn about a new open source project that AT&T is working on to allow any

49
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,840
Enterprise to be able to do this.

50
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,440
You already know by now that I geek out when it comes to talking about the intersection

51
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,400
of machine learning and cloud computing, and this conversation is no exception.

52
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,160
Be sure to let us know what you think by posting your comments or questions to the show

54
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,160
And now on to the show.

55
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:20,880
All right, everyone, I am on the line with Mazen Gilbert.

56
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,920
Mazen is Vice President of Advanced Technology and Architecture with AT&T.

57
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,960
Mazen, welcome to this weekend machine learning and AI.

58
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,320
Well, thank you very much for having me today.

59
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,120
Yeah, I'm excited to jump into this conversation.

60
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,560
You know, as is the tradition here, I like to get started by having you tell us a little

61
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,000
bit about your background and how you came to get involved in AI projects.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well, thanks.

63
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,320
So I started looking at AI and when I was just doing my graduate degree in the University

64
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:02,240
of Liverpool, I got fascinated in the mid 80s about how you could use these AI technologies

65
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,040
to really teach machines and computers and at the time, computers and machines were

66
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:13,520
very primitive, how you can get these machines and computers to do sort of what humans can

67
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,520
do.

68
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:20,760
They can think and say and listen the way humans are, either that was extremely fascinating.

69
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,760
It was an area that caught my passion and that started my graduate degree and I've been

70
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,280
involved in AI machine learning ever since.

71
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,280
Oh, wow.

72
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,680
What did you do your graduate degree in?

73
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:41,960
So my graduate degree, my PhD was on artificial neural networks for computer speech.

74
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,040
So basically at the time, the problem I was trying to solve is how do you get computers

75
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,320
to speak like humans using artificial neural networks?

76
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,320
Okay.

77
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,480
And what did speak like humans mean for you in that context?

78
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,800
It was really, speak like a humans as the way that you and I are speaking today.

79
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,200
The goal was to pass the touring test is that how can you get a machine to speak to you

80
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,800
for so many seconds or half a minute without you knowing that was really a machine?

81
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,760
Clearly in the past 30 years of a lot have changed but that was at the time, computer

82
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,640
speech was extremely, very machine like.

83
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,440
There was a lot of promise at the time of artificial neural networks could be sort of the new

84
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,560
technology that can completely change that because of the association of artificial neural

85
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,600
network with the real neural networks in the brain.

86
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,720
And that's turned out to be, turned out to be true in terms of all of the advances that

87
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,040
are happening now with deep learning.

88
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
Yeah.

89
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:53,440
Absolutely. I mean, it's quite astronomical to see how much deep learning, which is really

90
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,320
based on artificial neural network.

91
00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:01,840
How we've managed in the past 30 years to use those in a lot of different areas beyond

92
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,520
just computer speech, they're very powerful tools.

93
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:12,680
And I think what they've a lot of had changed in the past 30 years, but the basic algorithm,

94
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,920
the basic technologies from the 70s and 80s are still in use today.

95
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,400
And so did you go directly from grad school to AT&T?

96
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,400
I did.

97
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:30,760
So I actually came to visit AT&T Bell Labs in the late 80s while I was doing this work.

98
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,080
I was really fascinated by the place.

99
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,480
It was like a kid in a candy store, you know, it's like you get to do your passion and

100
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,080
your hobby and get paid for it, too.

101
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,800
So it was, it was really an amazing experience.

102
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,280
I knew at the time when I met a bunch of the folks that I used to sort of know them, when

103
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,200
I used to write these papers, they used to be like a reference in my book, a reference

104
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:56,600
in my papers.

105
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,920
And now I get to see them face to face and some of the pioneers that invented, you know,

106
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:07,640
a lot of amazing technology and digital transformation and transistors and others.

107
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:14,920
It was an amazing experience and it was very clear that was the place for me and honestly

108
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,880
as soon as I couldn't even wait to finish my graduate degree.

109
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,680
In fact, I ended up doing, I finished my graduate degree at AT&T Bell Labs because it was

110
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,440
an area they were very interested in and neural networks.

111
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,840
So that's how it started.

112
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,680
Oh, wow, wow.

113
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,880
Can you give me a, you know, certainly AT&T and the labs are, you know, doing a ton of

114
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:43,920
things with regards to AI, you know, how can you give us a kind of a landscape of the

115
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,080
different areas that you're working in?

116
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:53,480
Yeah, it's AI is a very critical area for us and has been ready for decades.

117
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,480
It is, it's really the way we think of AI.

118
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,600
It's a, it's a way of doing data powered smart automation and when you think about it as

119
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:09,000
it's just data powered smart automation, it really touches every part of our business.

120
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The machine learning side is what makes it data powered and the AI is what provides this

121
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
smart automation.

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,280
That's sort of how we think of the two and the relationship with each other.

123
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:25,000
The way we look at this is that where are we spending a lot of our dollars today and

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,480
that we need something new capabilities that are disruptive in the market, disruptive for

125
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,960
AT&T really to try to break down our cost structure and provide better experience to our

126
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,640
customers and better products to our customers.

127
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,320
So we've identified a number of what we call them, major pillars, several years back

128
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,920
and a lot of our activities are really focused on those pillars.

129
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
And what are they?

130
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,000
So the pillars are number one is infrastructure and engineering.

131
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,080
So think of that as a company like AT&T that invests significantly in capital and infrastructure

132
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:10,080
in building 4G and 5G and we're in the homes and we're in your devices and everything.

133
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,200
There's a huge infrastructure that we put in place.

134
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:17,440
So we spend a lot of time and capabilities in applying machine learning and AI to really

135
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,800
do smarter investment and spending of building out our infrastructure.

136
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,400
Where do we put the small sales, where do we put the macro sales, where do we invest

137
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:34,080
more in what part of the US, where there is most traffic or we think there will be traffic

138
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,160
over the next year to three years.

139
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,520
So that's infrastructure and engineering.

140
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,400
Number two is in the area of customer experience and I think customer care and customer experience

141
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:49,440
is the traditional approach as you know, the whole industry went into that with AI when

142
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,600
they started using speech recognition and speech synthesis and some natural language processing

143
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,880
to start doing part of what humans would do today, at least some of the basic things

144
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:06,400
of let's say understanding the intent of the customer and routing the customer.

145
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:13,000
So we're doing a lot of that and have been doing that for chat, for voice, for internet,

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
for email, basically the customer experience side of the game.

147
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,400
The third pillar that we also invest a lot of time is obviously security and when you

148
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:32,400
look at the size of AT&T and we provide our customers with a secure network, both consumer

149
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:39,120
and enterprise and those hackers are becoming smarter and smarter and so that we have to

150
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:46,960
apply the best and the latest technologies to identify even trends or patterns of an

151
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:53,240
initial attack to any of our customers or to our network so we can address that quickly

152
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,520
before it becomes a big issue and there are millions of those that are attempted every

153
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
hour of the day.

154
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,560
So that's a third area.

155
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,920
The fourth area is our network and operation.

156
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,920
As you know, we run one of the most complex networks in the world and that network has

157
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:17,920
evolved over the past century since the invention of the telephone.

158
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,960
You can imagine that there is a lot of push to try to make it zero touch, to make it

159
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,960
completely automated, to make it completely software defined.

160
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:30,760
So there's a lot of work we do in that area and the last one I will mention is sort of

161
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,160
the area where we look for a new revenue opportunity.

162
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:42,520
So we apply AI machine learning for advertising, media analytics and for a lot of our, in

163
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:48,000
the future, a lot of our enterprise businesses that they sell to customers, what that is

164
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,840
to do with the internet of things, what that is to do with smart cities, healthcare,

165
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,000
the opportunity space is big, AT&T is a very diverse company.

166
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,280
And as you can imagine, there are a lot of opportunities there.

167
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,560
That is a ton of stuff.

168
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:14,800
So in your role, what's your specific organization's responsibility with regard to these five

169
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,200
pillars is it staying ahead of kind of where this technology is going and then feeding

170
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,520
it back to businesses or are you building out projects and products that these businesses

171
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,320
can take advantage of?

172
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,880
How do you think of the role of your business?

173
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:36,280
So it's along the line what you said, I lead an organization, the advanced technology

174
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,880
and architecture.

175
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,160
This is the research arm also for AT&T.

176
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:47,760
And part of my responsibility is to ensure AT&T is always one step ahead and two steps

177
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,760
ahead.

178
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:54,680
So it's not just understanding the technology, but also understanding where are the opportunities

179
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,920
and the applications where we could provide value add to our customers and better products

180
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,320
and services to our customers.

181
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:07,520
That is part of my organization, part of the job that we do.

182
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,440
But beyond that, it's also about one thing I think you're just striking about all the

183
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,360
pillars I mentioned, we're not a company trying to build an application for AI.

184
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,800
We're not trying to build a voice personal assistant and make it a variable to our customers.

185
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
We're not.

186
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Right.

187
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,800
Right.

188
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,120
The use of AI machine learning for us is across many different services, many different

189
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,360
opportunities where we spend billions of dollars today in each of these pillars.

190
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:43,080
So there are not just 10 or 20, but they're literally in the thousands of applications

191
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,640
where AI machine learning is required.

192
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:51,160
So part of my responsibility is to make sure that we can scale and that each of these

193
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:58,520
application is not yet another service, new technology, new operation of its own, we

194
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:04,720
have to provide some harmonization to make sure that all of these thousands of applications,

195
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:10,880
when we get there, they all are built on a common platform, common technology, common

196
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,640
capability, so as technology evolve, you are benefiting everybody.

197
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,800
You're not building just a silo application for one set of users.

198
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:28,480
One of the challenges in building platforms when we're so early in the technology cycle

199
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,600
is that it's not clear what the pieces of that platform need to be.

200
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:40,560
How are you addressing that and other challenges that you run into given, you know, the scale

201
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,720
that you described and the fact that you're trying to apply AI very broadly across these

202
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,800
thousands of opportunities?

203
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,280
That's really a great question.

204
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,880
It's you're absolutely right.

205
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:59,320
I think that, you know, although the technology behind machine learning and AI have been

206
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:06,800
brewing for decades, but we are just at the tip of the mountain, touching that sort of

207
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,520
our initial, we're getting just a flavor of, well, where are all the opportunities, until

208
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,400
you understand all the opportunities, it's hard to say, well, here is the platform that's

209
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,160
going to support all these opportunities.

210
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,200
So you absolutely, absolutely right.

211
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,720
So the way we're looking at this is sort of a little different.

212
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,920
We're looking at this coming in saying, well, you are absolutely right.

213
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,400
And we have to enable the technology is going to continue to change.

214
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,280
There's going to be new applications.

215
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,720
There's going to be new tools.

216
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,680
There's going to be new capabilities.

217
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,960
The way we need to think about the platform, we have to build an open platform.

218
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:50,400
It's got to be an open platform that enable rapid innovation, not just within AT&T, but

219
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,640
within the global ecosystem.

220
00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:00,200
And it's a platform in which that our vendors and our suppliers and our partners are part

221
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,640
of the development of this platform, part of the ecosystem.

222
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:11,680
Because we are all sort of joining hands together to building sort of harmonizing the core

223
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,400
foundation behind AI across the world.

224
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,360
It's because every company out there have the same challenge, the same issue.

225
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,960
And every company is going to end up doing their own thing.

226
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Unless we really build the foundation platform to be open and transparent.

227
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:36,800
You know, I came across a reference on your website to Acumos, is that, you know, a platform

228
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,120
or the platform that you're describing?

229
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,600
That is absolutely right.

230
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,560
So, how this started is that when about a year ago, when we were looking at the applications,

231
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:52,280
AT&T has deployed or about to deploy an AI machine learning.

232
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,720
There were tens of, at least the ones that I have tracked, I'm sure there are plenty more.

233
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,360
The one I've managed to track, there are tens of applications already deployed or about

234
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,880
to be deployed.

235
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:10,720
When I looked at those, is sort of every application supported by every business unit is different.

236
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:18,200
It's different technology, different vendor, different tools, different operational support.

237
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:23,320
And it was very clear that it just, if this is the direction we're going as a company

238
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,200
and we absolutely are, it's just not possible to scale.

239
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:32,480
It's straightforward to build one or to build two.

240
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:38,600
But to go and build now and scale 20 and take 20 to 2000, you can't.

241
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,080
It's just not possible without having some commonality, okay?

242
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:50,560
So Acumos was really born as a result of that, thinking of AT&T as a customer, not as

243
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,600
a builder of a platform.

244
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:59,920
It was really built to try and solve three key problems that AT&T was being challenged.

245
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,160
And we just discovered since then is that pretty much most companies are being challenged

246
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,560
by those three problems.

247
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,600
The first problem is there are a lot of tools out there for machine learning and AI.

248
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,760
And you know, wait another week and somebody else is going to come out with another tool.

249
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,440
And we love some of these tools.

250
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,600
Some of them are very specialized in some markets, some of them are specialized by the company.

251
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,800
They're great tools.

252
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,320
There's no one size fits all.

253
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,400
So the first problem we wanted to solve, even with an AT&T, we found out many people

254
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,760
are using many tools.

255
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,760
First we tried to force everybody to use one tool.

256
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,640
We actually put out, you know, two, three years ago, an open source tool for machine learning

257
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,040
and a statistical modeling called our cloud.

258
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,600
And we were hoping to force everybody in AT&T to use it and frankly we failed.

259
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,000
We ended up finding some people use it and some people like to use other tools that's

260
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
you know, even built by AT&T.

261
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Okay.

262
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,160
So so we sort of we sort of moved away from that approach and we decided that the problem

263
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:11,520
we need to solve with this Akimus number one, Akimus need to harmonize across all the

264
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,680
tools.

265
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:19,440
So if I use tool A and you use tool B, even though we may not be working with each other,

266
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,880
we may not even talking to each other.

267
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:28,280
But the output of my tool A and the output of your tool B need to be like Legos and not

268
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,440
snowflakes.

269
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,440
Okay.

270
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,800
These things have to connect.

271
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:36,240
These things have to have to sort of interoperate with each other.

272
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,000
Not being sort of every tool is its own cycle.

273
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,600
So that's number one thing that Akimus is attempting to sort of solve.

274
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:48,160
And that's the problem we're trying to solve there, a higher minimization.

275
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,840
The second problem we're trying to solve is that, and I think you know this very well,

276
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:58,640
is that to build machine learning models or algorithms, it's very difficult.

277
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,920
It's not easy to do.

278
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,680
People talk about hiring PhDs and people will graduate degree.

279
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,440
Well how many of them are there today?

280
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,680
And how many companies require that skill set?

281
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,680
Okay.

282
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:13,600
I've been talking about lowering the barrier, making it easier.

283
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,080
But you know what, it's never, has been easier.

284
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,560
It's difficult.

285
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
It's difficult to do.

286
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,760
It requires some extensive understanding of the data.

287
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,160
It requires extensive cleansing of the data.

288
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:34,760
Why is you learning about some deep technologies, understanding what an ROC curve is, what a

289
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:40,120
type one error, what a type two error is, it allows you to understand what is a gradient

290
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,040
descent in neural network is.

291
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,760
These are very deep things.

292
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,240
And unless you go and take some deep courses and play with your favorite tool, whether it's

293
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:54,720
scikit-learn or TensorFlow or cafe or whatever, you're not going to learn this, okay?

294
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,760
And that's what they do in graduate degrees.

295
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:02,600
So the second problem we wanted to solve with Akimus was that we need to lower the barrier

296
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,320
to entry.

297
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:13,240
So that if Mazin goes and build a model, and maybe Mazin takes weeks, uses GPUs and takes

298
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,000
weeks to build that model.

299
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,720
But then if Sam wants to go and use that model, it should be available in a marketplace.

300
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,000
You should just grab and use and plug into somewhere.

301
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,320
And so that the second thing Akimus provides is a marketplace.

302
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,200
Is a marketplace that says, think of that the App Store.

303
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,640
I can go somewhere, I can see what everybody else has built worldwide.

304
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,000
And I could look at the review, the rating, and I can pick what I want.

305
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,040
I don't have to rebuild it.

306
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,120
We don't have to rebuild everything from scratch.

307
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,360
It's very expensive to rebuild.

308
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,000
We have to be thinking about reuse and improve as opposed to rebuild.

309
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,280
So that's what is the Akimus marketplace.

310
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,680
But what we do in the Akimus marketplace is more than an App Store.

311
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:09,920
But it does also, it says, if I built something and Taylor built something else, then her capability

312
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,720
and mine are microservices that we can just join together.

313
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,000
We can actually put those two together like Legos.

314
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,360
You can come in and connect what she has and what I have from the marketplace create a

315
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,280
new application that didn't exist before.

316
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:29,240
So these applications, these microservices are interoperable.

317
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:34,640
And the third thing we wanted to solve is to say, when you build the model with any tool

318
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:42,200
you want, I want to be able to deploy this model with any cloud and I want it to be minutes.

319
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,480
And I don't want to learn what a Docker container is.

320
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,200
I don't want to learn what Jenkins job is.

321
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:51,200
I don't want to learn what a G or a ticket is.

322
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,520
And I don't want to learn the internals of a third party cloud.

323
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,840
It should be really like, I build it.

324
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,560
I submit and it takes me all the way to it's running on a third party cloud.

325
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,640
That's sort of, again, what Akumus is trying to do.

326
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Okay.

327
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,440
There's a ton in there to dig into.

328
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:13,920
I noticed on the Akumus page that there is an affiliation with the Linux foundation

329
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,240
or at least a project.

330
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:20,720
I'm assuming is the project is being kind of managed under the Linux foundation.

331
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,880
Does that mean that for taking another step back?

332
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,280
It sounds like a lot of the things that you described are almost outside of the realm

333
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:37,120
of what we think about when we think of traditional AI machine learning tooling.

334
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,720
It's more like the kinds of concerns that platform as a service has come along to try to

335
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
help with.

336
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:48,920
Is the implication of that in the Linux foundation involvement that this is built on cloud

337
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,280
foundry or is taking a similar approach?

338
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,440
So number one, you hit the nail on the head.

339
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:02,280
This is Akumus is not competing with the tools, the many tools that's out there today.

340
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:09,480
In fact, we want to encourage communities and companies to innovate and building the

341
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,520
next big, better algorithm.

342
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:18,440
How do you do deep learning now with a thousand layers instead of 20, 30 layers?

343
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,920
How do you have trillion of neurons as opposed to a billion of neurons?

344
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:29,160
We absolutely want companies and communities and industries and universities to innovate.

345
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:34,760
We're trying to fill a gap, a gap that every company in the world, if they want to seriously

346
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,640
look at AI machine learning, they have to fill.

347
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,680
And today that gap is so large that you can hire the best PhDs and you still will never

348
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:51,640
be able to scale deployment, adoption, and improvement of AI machine learning services.

349
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:57,000
Linux Foundation, we have an incredible relationship with the Linux Foundation.

350
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:03,320
We co-created Akumus with a partner of ours, Tech Mahendra, and we're hosting it under

351
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,400
the Linux Foundation.

352
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,240
Linux Foundation will host the marketplace and the platform.

353
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:15,960
And we will work with the Linux Foundation to grow a community of companies and institutions

354
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:24,360
and universities to really co-create together the foundation of how we want to scale and

355
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,320
adopt AI globally.

356
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,600
So we are already in discussions with a number of companies.

357
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:34,240
So we don't consider this as an AT&T or a Tech Mahendra effort.

358
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,960
We consider that we've started a seed and the Linux Foundation is going to help to grow

359
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:47,400
that seed and really build a lot of beautiful trees with the help of a larger community.

360
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,040
This isn't the first time we've seen things like this.

361
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:57,200
It really reminds me a lot of, for example, what Intel was trying to do with their TAP platform.

362
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,080
I don't know if you've ever come across that, but I'm not even sure they're still working

363
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
on that.

364
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:11,360
It's a huge problem where you're trying to integrate these many, many disparate components

365
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,680
like lots of tools.

366
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:18,080
In their case, I think they also built it on Cloud Foundry and then they had Hadoop and

367
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,920
a bunch of data lakes stuff underneath.

368
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,080
These are all very complex enterprise technologies.

369
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:31,800
They're all evolving very rapidly in their own different directions.

370
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,880
I guess my question is maybe pushing back on the whole idea of doing this.

371
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,320
Why do you think you can succeed at this?

372
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,360
It's such a Herculean task and so many have tried and failed.

373
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,600
It's a great question.

374
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:54,120
And frankly, if we don't solve this problem, if we don't solve this problem worldwide,

375
00:27:54,120 --> 00:28:00,880
the adoption of what you see in the media about AI and machine learning is very limited.

376
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,960
It's going to be limited to a few companies who can afford to do it, a few companies who

377
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:11,480
have the expertise and a few companies who can build one or two applications here and

378
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,320
there.

379
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,120
We have to solve this gap.

380
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
It is a big gap.

381
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,320
You're absolutely right.

382
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,960
But I'll tell you what we are doing that's very different.

383
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,280
And we have experience in this five years ago.

384
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:30,480
We started with just as a big challenge as this one, as Akimos, which is we decided to

385
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:37,240
completely convert the AT&T century sort of young network that's been developed over

386
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,560
many, many decades.

387
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:46,520
We decided to completely move that to a software defined using the best technology in SDN and

388
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,520
virtualize the network function.

389
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,760
So this is like the core of the network.

390
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:56,000
You're now saying, I can build the core of a network like a web company where everything

391
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,440
is software running on a cloud environment, commodity cloud hardware.

392
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,400
That's just not possible.

393
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Well we went through that avenue and we started deploying that three years ago, but we

394
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,680
realized a year ago there's something missing in here.

395
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,720
What's missing is that we've invested significantly to making that happen.

396
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,880
Hundreds of people, a lot of expertise, other companies can't do that, okay?

397
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,320
And other operators cannot do that.

398
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:29,120
And just having us doing something and operators are not, that's going to compromise the experience.

399
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,200
That's going to also compromise the cost to the end customer.

400
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,320
We need all operators, all vendors to be part of this.

401
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,400
And so we made it open source under the Linux Foundation and there's something called

402
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,640
ONAP.

403
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,520
And in the short seven months, we've been at this journey this year.

404
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:49,360
We have 50 plus companies.

405
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:56,360
We have 1400 technical people co-developing from these companies.

406
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,920
And we cover 55% of the global sub.

407
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:04,880
These are the operators, the China mobiles, the China telecom, the Vodafone's, the Orange

408
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,720
and Bel Canada and many of the brands that you basically hear about.

409
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,800
We've cracked the code that the way to do it is that if we can all chip in and if we all

410
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:21,680
can build thing, it build it together, we can create something better than anyone company

411
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,160
trying it on their own.

412
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,120
This is what we're trying to do the same thing with Akimas.

413
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,680
This is if AT&T ends up the only one or AT&T and Tec Mahandra, the only one doing this,

414
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
it will fail.

415
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,440
I'll just tell you that flat face, okay?

416
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,800
But what's going to be different in here, that's not what we're seeing from the companies

417
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
we're talking to already.

418
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,240
I can tell you that right now.

419
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,720
What we're seeing is a tremendous momentum.

420
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
They all realize the big gap.

421
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,360
They all realize the big challenging gap that you're talking about.

422
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:56,560
And by having a community come together and each of the companies chip into what they believe

423
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,320
is important to them.

424
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,560
So we will come in and say, well, what's going to work on our native cloud environment?

425
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,480
And it's going to work on a couple of third party cloud that has to work.

426
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,240
And it's going to do X, Y and Z.

427
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,240
Other companies are coming in with slightly similar, what's different also attitude, bringing

428
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,960
it all that together is really what's going to crack this.

429
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,920
It's not going to be AT&T, it's going to be a community building it together.

430
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,760
All of the times that's happened in the past, it's been one company trying to do it, trying

431
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,360
to boil an ocean.

432
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,960
What we're doing in here, there's no one company in the world can do it.

433
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,840
It has to be a community, a global community efforts.

434
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:37,840
Interesting.

435
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,360
So you mentioned ONAP.

436
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,440
This is maybe going a little bit deeper down this rabbit hole, but what's the relationship

437
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,720
between ONAP, which I hadn't heard of, and OpenStack?

438
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:56,200
I'm fairly familiar with AT&T's involvement over the years in OpenStack and in particular,

439
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,440
working to build NFV deployments on top of OpenStack.

440
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,440
Yeah.

441
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,840
The two are already like brothers and sisters, the complimentary and brothers and sisters.

442
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:11,840
OpenStack is the, we are a big user of OpenStack.

443
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,680
We've built our AT&T integrated cloud platform based on OpenStack.

444
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:24,440
So we take OpenStack, we're a significant part of OpenStack as part of the board as

445
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,440
well.

446
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,360
We ingest OpenStack and we build our AT&T cloud and this is what we use as the infrastructure

447
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,120
to virtualize our network functions.

448
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,840
So when I'm talking about virtualizing the network functions, moving our network to

449
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:46,520
software defined, it's all using our cloud and sort of a hybrid cloud of our cloud and

450
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,800
third-party cloud and OpenStack is a big part of that.

451
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:55,280
ONAP, is it, once you have that, once you have these network functions and you have your

452
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:00,880
cloud environment, well, you need to orchestrate these network functions.

453
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:07,440
You need to automate the design and the testing and the deployment of those network functions.

454
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,160
You need to do life cycle management of these network functions.

455
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,800
Something could go wrong, they could be a threat, they could be a failure.

456
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:23,600
So that is what ONAP does, it's an orchestration, automation, platform for both virtual and

457
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,160
physical network functions and life cycle management.

458
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:34,840
The two go together, you need ONAP on top of OpenStack and our AT&T integrated cloud to

459
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,480
really try to virtualize these functions.

460
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:53,040
Acumus and AI is a key sort of, a key enabler to enable both the cloud and the ONAP to automate

461
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,160
functionalities.

462
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,760
There are machine learning data driven.

463
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:04,360
So if ONAP comes in and says, I want to use data driven capabilities to predict there's

464
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,400
going to be a failure in the network in a particular location for a particular customer

465
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,920
an hour from now.

466
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:17,960
That's where machine learning and acumus comes in is creating these predictive, sophisticated

467
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:27,040
capabilities to make the ONAP and the integrated cloud data driven and predictable and have

468
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,840
a predictive capabilities.

469
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:34,320
I actually very keen on digging a little deeper into some of these network and operations

470
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,480
use cases, but I do have one question on acumus before we do that.

471
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:47,480
I noticed or didn't notice the lack of on the acumus page a link to like a GitHub repository

472
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,760
or something like that.

473
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,800
What stage is acumus in?

474
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,480
Is it a vision or is there more, something more tangible to it today that folks can get

475
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,480
access to?

476
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,120
I always start with a vision, but what it is, it's not just a vision.

477
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:06,040
If it was a vision, then we wouldn't be having the conversation, I'll be honest with you.

478
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:11,200
We believe you have to have something real, but this is a community effort.

479
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,920
Like you said, technology is changing a lot, but there's some basic foundation you have

480
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,920
to build.

481
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:23,000
What we've done is we announced this a couple of weeks ago or whatever, 10 days ago.

482
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:30,040
Next week, literally next week, we're moving all the software to the Linux foundation.

483
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:36,320
We built the software, we built the seed capabilities of everything I talked to you about.

484
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,960
The seed software of everything I talked about is being built, and we're moving it to

485
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,720
the Linux foundation next week.

486
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,560
We believe that the Linux foundation, they're going to set it up and set up their CICD

487
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,760
environment and testing environments by December, mid-December.

488
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,240
We believe, and again, that's up to the Linux foundation to make it available, but initially

489
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:04,360
it will be available for friendly companies who are going to be joining the project, and

490
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:10,200
early next year, in one queue next year, it's going to be available to the public.

491
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,200
Okay.

492
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,840
Well, I'll definitely be following along.

493
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:19,600
It sounds like an interesting project, and I can definitely, there's no question that

494
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,560
the need is there.

495
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,680
But it's, again, it's a huge challenge.

496
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,600
So network and operations.

497
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:34,320
I think maybe the most famous, maybe the most public kind of proof point, example point

498
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,200
here is some of the work that Google has done in this area where they showed that they

499
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:44,800
were able to reduce their cost of, I don't remember if it was the overall cost of data

500
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:49,720
center operations, or they're the heating and cooling costs by some 40%.

501
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,840
This is going back a year and change ago.

502
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:57,880
That's certainly, you know, certainly there are huge opportunities there for AT&T.

503
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,200
How are you attacking that space?

504
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Yeah, it's a key space for us.

505
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:13,080
So number one, we probably have more data centers than many companies that I know today in

506
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,400
the United States.

507
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,600
We own different types of data centers from small to large to support our customers.

508
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:25,440
So when you start thinking about how does this all come together, first is that all the

509
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,920
capabilities in these data centers, first have to be software.

510
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,280
They have to be software running on cloud commodity hardware.

511
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,160
If you don't do that, then it's pretty much difficult to do anything else, including

512
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,400
artificial intelligence and acrimus.

513
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,000
You can't, unless you move to a software world.

514
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,880
And we've been doing that for the past five years, and that's part of this own app

515
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,080
effort that I just talked to you about.

516
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,480
We are basically going in that directions.

517
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,880
But where we are applying the technology in our data centers and we will continue to doubling

518
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:09,280
down in this space from a machine learning perspective and an AI perspective is not just

519
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,320
about energy consumption, which is the example that you gave.

520
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,640
Although that by itself is a big opportunity.

521
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,840
I don't want to minimize that.

522
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:26,600
But there are tremendous inefficiencies one can apply machine learning and AI to really

523
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,880
do something cheaper, faster, and better.

524
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,360
And combine that with human expertise, you could really sort of combine the best of both

525
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,360
well.

526
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,560
So doing something that we just can't even do today.

527
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:47,760
So we're not just applying it to looking at energy saving, but there are tremendous opportunities

528
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,960
in terms of operating these data centers.

529
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,680
There are many functions in these data centers.

530
00:38:54,680 --> 00:39:00,400
Just think of, you know, we as a network company, we support the world here.

531
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:06,000
And there are switches, there are routers, there are firewalls.

532
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:11,560
This is the core core of our network of how packets go from A to B.

533
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,120
That's sort of the basics here.

534
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:19,960
All of these have to be automated and it has to be done in such a way that is intelligent.

535
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,440
So I'll give you a simple example.

536
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:28,560
At every second of the day in the United States, traffic changes.

537
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,120
And in some cases, we know and we predict that.

538
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,320
In some cases, we don't know.

539
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:38,960
Suddenly, there is a big event happening in a particular location, a particular city,

540
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,240
in a particular corner that just doesn't happen any day or any year, okay?

541
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:51,560
So part of what we apply machine learning in AI is to really dynamically configure our

542
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,400
network and our resources around the clock.

543
00:39:55,400 --> 00:40:01,120
So I use this metaphor as the think of like we're building a virtual city.

544
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:08,960
That's the United States where we have limited capacity, but the roads, the roads can become

545
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,120
narrower or wider as long as the physical space is the same.

546
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:19,040
And how wide or narrow you make that is can change every second of a day.

547
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,280
And that's what we're using machine learning in AI to say, well, how much capacity can I put

548
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,200
in that second of a day there because we're predicting some traffic is going to be there

549
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,100
over the next one hour or five hours, okay?

550
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,280
And where do I take capacity from?

551
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,760
But imagine doing that and optimizing that around the clock.

552
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,360
That's a big, big undertaking.

553
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:44,400
So that's just one other example where we're applying these capabilities.

554
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:49,800
Are there some other specific examples or use cases that come to mind within the context

555
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,040
of networking ops?

556
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,440
Yeah.

557
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,560
So another example is that, so imagine a firewall goes down.

558
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,560
What do you do?

559
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:03,320
All days you, it's failed, somebody has to literally go there, has to remove it, put a new

560
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:06,680
device in there, new firewall, okay?

561
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,640
And plug everything in, test it, makes it work, could take days, could take weeks depending

562
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,160
if there are extra hardware available, et cetera.

563
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,440
Today, that's completely different.

564
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:23,120
It's number one, I can spin up the firewall or that switch at any point of the day, okay?

565
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,120
In any location.

566
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,120
That's number one.

567
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,680
That's the vision of what we're going after and we started already excluding on that

568
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,680
vision.

569
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,160
We're reaching about 55% of our target network in terms of virtualization by the end of

570
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,720
this year, okay?

571
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:42,360
So now, once I can put these capabilities there, the problem happens is that, okay, well

572
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,800
what happens now if it goes down?

573
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,080
Well, what we're implementing today is what we call it an AI closed loop, which means

574
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,680
that we have the capability of extracting data from this, let's say, firewall.

575
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,840
We're able to process and this data using machine learning.

576
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:07,440
We're able to predict if there are some failures, maybe happening, or some degradation.

577
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,080
We are able to apply policies to say, okay, well, we know there's something going on that's

578
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,640
bad, okay?

579
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,200
We know the driver is this, what do I do?

580
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,480
It could be that, well, rebuild the firewall, okay?

581
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,120
And then we need an action to go and take that action, okay?

582
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:26,200
Today, that's a manual effort.

583
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:32,080
Tickets are being, you know, we developed tickets, thousands of tickets around the clock,

584
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,680
hoping that a human is an expert is going to look at those tickets and take an action.

585
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:41,040
But really, a good portion of those tickets are things we already know.

586
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,520
We've learned from the data.

587
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,960
We know what's a good action, what a bad action.

588
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,160
That's where AI comes in is learning the good action from the bad action.

589
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,760
And being able to automate and do this closed loop in a complete automated way, which could

590
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,280
be reboots, it could be just move the traffic.

591
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:03,240
There's something chronic about the device, move the traffic and stand up traffic, stand

592
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,400
at the applications in another device or another firewall.

593
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:12,040
And that's sort of, again, you can think of the same thing we're doing with security.

594
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:16,320
There are many, many applications like this we are investigating today.

595
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:24,520
From taking a step back from a portfolio perspective, how do you kind of manage the investments

596
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,240
across all of these various opportunities that you have?

597
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,080
Yeah, that's a good, great question.

598
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:38,320
I mean, it's a number one, the reason why we are building a platform, we've done this

599
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,600
for our virtualized cloud.

600
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,120
Companies are doing that too for their virtualized cloud.

601
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:48,400
We're doing this for our orchestration and automation platform, the own app and what

602
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,200
we call it, e-comm inside AT&T.

603
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,360
We're doing this for machine learning and AI.

604
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:59,840
First, you've got to make sure the foundation is built once, developed by a community in

605
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:04,040
an open transparent way, but it's built once and evolved.

606
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,840
It's not changed every time from an investment that's just prohibitive, okay?

607
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,040
That's number one.

608
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:16,240
Number two, anything that sits on top of that investment, we're sort of making sure it

609
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:23,360
is software and making sure that you could take an investment that we already have and drive

610
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:27,360
that cost down with this new world of machine learning and software.

611
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:33,800
So every opportunity I talk to you about, it's not a vision and it's not something we would

612
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,800
like to do.

613
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,440
It's something we're doing today because there is billions of dollars.

614
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,240
We have a business case that says, if we do this through software and through own app

615
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:49,120
and through machine learning, we can say 50% of the cost.

616
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:54,440
So we're going after those where there are billions attached and with a technology and

617
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,160
the business case shows we can really shave a lot out of these investments, whether it's

618
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,640
capital investments or expense.

619
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:08,640
Certainly, AT&T has more resources available to it than many companies, but those resources

620
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,280
nonetheless are not unlimited.

621
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:18,280
What are the biggest challenges that you're finding in attacking your wish list?

622
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,960
I'm imagining that you've got way more places that you'd like to apply this technology

623
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,760
than you can actually take on at any given time.

624
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:27,760
Yeah.

625
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:34,480
Beyond the platform is a gaming like we've talked about that and I totally agree that in

626
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:39,040
the situation that you've described, building out a platform that lowers the barrier to

627
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:48,440
entry for other parts of the organization to build on top of is a great place to start.

628
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:53,760
But then what are the other barriers that if you can figure out how to fix those, you

629
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,680
would be able to accelerate your adoption?

630
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:03,600
So number one is that every company and where no different has limited resources and that's

631
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,600
number one.

632
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,640
Number two, we're not doing it alone.

633
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,560
We cannot do it alone, independent of even if you have the resources, it's you need the

634
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:17,320
skill set and subject matter expertise in different areas, network expertise and functions

635
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:21,400
that we may have some, but not others.

636
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:29,640
The challenge here is ensuring the ecosystem we work with, the suppliers, the vendors,

637
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:37,120
the partners that we do active engagement with today, all of us are working with the same

638
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,480
framework, with the same DNA, with the same sort of platform.

639
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,760
That is really how it's a win-win for everybody.

640
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,640
So that's number one challenge.

641
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,840
We've done a lot of progress in that, which led us to where we are today, but that is

642
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:58,480
definitely a challenge is getting everybody to go into sort of one path and using something

643
00:46:58,480 --> 00:46:59,480
coming.

644
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:05,920
Imagine that if every car manufacturers build their car without any specifications, without

645
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,600
any sort of blueprints, it's going to be very expensive.

646
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:15,000
But today, all cars come with literally sort of four wheels maybe, they have a steering,

647
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:19,960
they have a seat, there are some expectations that every car has to have, but every car

648
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:21,760
manufacturers compete differently.

649
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,640
Well, imagine if that was not the case, if there were no specifications, then every car

650
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,720
has to be built so differently from scratch.

651
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,040
It costs a lot of money to build that car.

652
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:37,800
Today, that's not the case and car manufacturers have managed to get all their sort of suppliers

653
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,040
and vendors to align.

654
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,960
We're trying to do the same thing here.

655
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:47,120
This is a journey, AT&T is a leader in this journey from the networking side.

656
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:52,400
When you look at all the operators, we went to open source also to bring in other operators

657
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:58,840
into this game and work with them together so that it's a win-win for both of us.

658
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:05,800
That's a key challenge is harmonization, which is lead us to the relationship we have with

659
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:11,480
the Linux Foundation as a partner to help us drive harmonization worldwide.

660
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:16,040
Well, you certainly shared a lot of jewels with us.

661
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:22,160
Are there any other thoughts that you want to share with the audience on, if they're

662
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,040
trying to figure this all out, maybe where they should start or what they should do or

663
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:32,280
any other thoughts on any thoughts that you'd like to close us out with?

664
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,280
Sure.

665
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:40,000
Number one, I think that no matter which company you're from and no matter what investment

666
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,520
you have, don't build your own thing.

667
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:49,560
You have to decide what is a value at your company and a competitive edge for you versus

668
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,960
something that is really should be just mainstream.

669
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,920
So number one is that be part of an open source movement.

670
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,800
Join us in the networking side, join us in ONA.

671
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:05,680
If you are in the machine learning AI side, don't invest in your own silos.

672
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:12,520
Join us in a community so that your investment is multiplied by a factor of 100 with other

673
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:13,520
people's investments.

674
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,160
Don't do it alone.

675
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,840
That's sort of number one.

676
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:23,880
It's be part of the open source and really keep your secret sauce, but trying to use your

677
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,960
investment plus others to build something that's phenomenal.

678
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:34,600
Number two is as we build the foundation altogether, I think Sky is the limit in terms

679
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,120
of the applications.

680
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,160
We're just touching the surface of that.

681
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:45,040
I know everyone talks about things like voice recognition and facial detection.

682
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,560
These are wonderful.

683
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:50,040
These are great applications.

684
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:52,720
Research in these applications started three, four decades ago.

685
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,960
If you go back to the 70s, 80s, that's how it started.

686
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,840
And today we are at a point where we can commercialize, but there are a lot of opportunities of

687
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:01,840
applications.

688
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:07,960
We haven't even thought of applications, especially as we get to 5G and the Internet of

689
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:16,080
Things and Edge Cloud and applications that none of us have even conceived they existed.

690
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:22,040
We would love to expedite that innovations and that inventions and we would love everyone

691
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:28,800
to really be part of the movement and not to take a sideline and watch.

692
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,880
This is a big movement.

693
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:35,400
This is going to change the future of the industry worldwide.

694
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,400
Get involved.

695
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,560
Well, that's great.

696
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:38,560
That's great.

697
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:43,000
