00:00.000 --> 00:08.840
So, hello. We want to be the AI cramudgeon, at least the personal AI cramudgeon. You know,

00:08.840 --> 00:14.400
when I think about what AI could be in the promise that we have for home automation,

00:14.400 --> 00:20.760
this personal assistance, they're just not there. I've been disappointed in voice, I've

00:20.760 --> 00:26.800
been disappointed in a lot of my interactions where we're trying to have real artificial

00:26.800 --> 00:30.720
intelligence to something that reads my calendar and makes recommendations or I interact

00:30.720 --> 00:36.960
with a robot to calendar something. These lots of you desired and the idea that I have

00:36.960 --> 00:43.120
to double check and triple check or type and re-type makes me pretty frustrated to interact

00:43.120 --> 00:48.760
with AI's right now. So, we have a long way to go. The promise is there. There is absolutely

00:48.760 --> 00:55.720
no doubt that we should be using much deeper computer systems to anticipate newer

00:55.720 --> 01:02.320
behaviors and help us interact with technology and ways that are actually to humans very,

01:02.320 --> 01:08.120
very predictable. So, the potential is there. It seems like it should be a solvable problem,

01:08.120 --> 01:14.440
but from a personal perspective, it also feels farther off than I would like. At the same

01:14.440 --> 01:17.960
time, I think we're using deep learning and machine learning in incredible ways in a

01:17.960 --> 01:23.800
corporate setting where you have people with deep experience and masters and doctorate

01:23.800 --> 01:29.240
degrees in these technologies, applying these technologies, mining our personal data.

01:29.240 --> 01:32.920
And so, when I think about some of the stuff I'm excited as a technologist and a little

01:32.920 --> 01:40.680
scared as a human, not from the robot takeover, but more from not understanding the social

01:40.680 --> 01:45.520
implications of where my data is going and where people are learning about my behaviors

01:45.520 --> 01:50.240
and applying it to things that I don't have a lot of control over. So, I'm going to be

01:50.240 --> 01:56.920
AI-commogen here and say, it's coming, but we need to think about what it means. Thanks.
