00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,240
Hi, everyone. I'm super excited to be back here at the process AI marketplace and especially

2
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,720
please for the opportunity to speak with Prashant on the topic of building technical communities

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,720
and the opportunities created by data and AI. As Paul mentioned, I will be monitoring the Q&A

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,200
panel for your questions and we'll either work them in or we'll have some time at the end.

5
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,120
But I'm really looking forward to this. So let's just dive in.

6
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:51,440
Prashant, I imagine that everyone here in our audience has some personal experience with stack

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:59,840
overflow as a user. But what can you tell us to help us understand the scale of what you've built?

8
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,960
Yeah, I know. Thank you, Sam, for inviting me here and for moderating the session.

9
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,800
I also congrats to you for building such an amazing community around this space,

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,960
particularly in AI and ML. So it's been amazing to see all of you accomplished.

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,680
So yeah, so stackable flow, I think, again, I can't take all the credit for it,

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,760
so it's really our community and our founders and the team that has been here for about 13 years.

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:32,320
We were founded in 2008. I joined as the new CEO in 2019 and we had several amazing

14
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,360
leaders that have joined since to help us scale to the next level. But the scale at which we

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,960
all create is massive. So we have close to 100 million monthly visitors from around the world.

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:52,480
There is no geography that we don't touch for the most part. We have something like 50 million

17
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:58,400
questions and answers on every possible technology topic. So everything from an Amazon web

18
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:05,440
services, which has under 250,000 questions and answers or something like even data science,

19
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,840
which is obviously an idea to this audience, we have something like 31,000 questions in that

20
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,080
sort of space alone or any scripting language, programming language, you name it, right? So

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,520
all that content exists in a very sort of significant way. And that information has been access

22
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:28,480
close to 50 billion times since our inception. So the impact on what we arrive in the industry

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,320
is massive. And since we are talking to a data-specific audience, just to put that in terms of

24
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:41,600
terabytes, in terms of the public, the public actually has access in all of you. The audience

25
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:47,200
have access to about one terabyte worth of questions and answers and comments that are available

26
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,680
for your own sort of analysis and other things that you can do with that. But internally,

27
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,120
we have something close to 70 terabytes of data available for our own internal analysis. So you

28
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,200
know, fairly meaningful scale. And having said all that, I would still say that we're fairly early

29
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,920
in that sort of evolution. But I'd hopefully give you a sense of how large we are and we operate,

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,960
you know, obviously globally. That's awesome. Awesome. So beyond the stats and figures,

31
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,160
what are some surprising things you can tell us about Stack Overflow that, you know, most folks

32
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:25,440
might not realize or know? Yeah, I think most people know us as the public website with all the stats

33
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,880
that I just explained. And that's been sort of, you know, what has been, you know, driving the

34
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,640
impact from the industry for the past 13 years. But most people probably don't know or do not know

35
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,440
that we have a very thriving, fast growing SaaS business and a very fast growing advertising

36
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,520
focused business. And those are two business lines that have been sort of, you know,

37
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,760
thriving throughout the history of the company. But more recently, our SaaS transformation,

38
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,040
just one of the reasons I came on board along with the two other leaders is really been really

39
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,560
exceptional to see, right? That is effectively a private version of our public platform that I

40
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,400
explained for enterprises and other sort of organizations to use internally to collaborate

41
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,560
asynchronously using the same platform that developers and technologists have been enjoying with

42
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,680
the vast decade or so. So that is, you know, probably the most unknown fact when people go to

43
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,640
Stack Overflow through a Google search, landed an answer. They typically get the answer. They're

44
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,440
in the workflow of trying to, you know, again, unstuck and they're on their way. But typically,

45
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,640
what now we're beginning to surface and more and more that, you know, we have these paid products

46
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:37,360
that are equally useful and value added for a user as they say they operate within organizations

47
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:47,920
and companies. Great, great. Paul mentioned that you joined in October of 2019. So just about two

48
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:54,480
years ago and you stepped into the role that was previously held by the company's very well-known

49
00:04:54,480 --> 00:05:02,640
founder, Joel Spolsky. And, you know, Jeff Atwood as well, like a very strong founder

50
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:11,040
culture at the company and curious about how that transition came about, what the culture of

51
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,560
the organization was like and what were your priorities when you joined? Yeah, no, absolutely,

52
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,840
I think, you know, it's a, it's a huge blessing to have amazing founders, right? Joel Spolsky

53
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,160
and Jeff Atwood are 100% credited with, you know, what they've actually built, right? They

54
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,840
along with the community and the stackers that have, they were here in the first decade of the

55
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,080
company, built this amazing community and public platform that, you know, the stats that I mentioned

56
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,640
are a product of their sort of very, you know, lots of volunteers to be very thoughtful about

57
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,360
how to make trade-offs and how to ensure ultimately that the best answer is ultimately a deliver

58
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,000
to somebody that is stuck in a, you know, in a technical situation. And so what happened was,

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,360
you know, the company grew, you know, in terms of its impact and then there was this question of

60
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,000
what is the sort of sustainable business model for the company point for? So there was this sort of

61
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:09,040
existential question and Jeff Atwood had to left the company several years ago as the first

62
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,960
one. So the remaining founder, Joel, was the CEO of the company. And through 2019, you know, he,

63
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,480
he sort of just along with the board of the company, which is, you know, all, you know,

64
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,640
previous field, one of the, you know, the fairly prominent venture capital firms like Union Square

65
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,240
Ventures and Index Ventures and Spark and then recent Horowitz and so on, decided that it was

66
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,440
time to bring in some extra to the perspective. Somebody who had helped grow a very rapidly,

67
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,440
you know, scaling organization, especially as we thought about the SaaS business model of the

68
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,440
software as a service business model. So, you know, Lauren, and you know, fast forward a little

69
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,600
bit after about 250 interviews with many different people, you know, they literally, you know, I

70
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,240
think they, they, they, they talked about this green about 250 candidates. They did end up

71
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,880
finding me and I was a relevant for the role and for a couple of the mentors. One is, of course,

72
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,440
I was a user of stack, all my teams at RAC spaces through the introduction was mentioned,

73
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,840
you stack all flow throughout, you know, so I, so I was obviously very aware of it, my teams

74
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,720
were aware of it. So there's an appreciation for what this community stands for and what it does.

75
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,320
And at the same time, my experience, my personal experience of having sort of helped scale

76
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,320
the cloud services business at RAC space to help pivot it from a data center company or

77
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:28,960
manage hosting company to more of a services company on delivering services cloud services on top of AWS

78
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,640
Azure and Google Cloud, that, that which became one of the fastest growing businesses at RAC space,

79
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:40,800
that experience was also relevant here because there's a sort of opportunity with this raw material

80
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,560
and the, you know, this diamond and the rough with stack all flow, how do we really scale the

81
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,720
organization? So those two sort of elements, one, my own sort of, you know, sort of real appreciation for

82
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,040
what this community is all about. And secondly, my experience is really ultimately what, you know,

83
00:07:55,040 --> 00:08:00,640
brought me here. And since then, you know, we've hired some amazing leaders who you're asking how

84
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,560
the transition's been beyond, of course, meeting with community members, my, you know, my first year,

85
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,520
meeting with customers, meeting with stackers, as we call them, my employees. And really, you know,

86
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,840
I'm a fairly hands-on person on that in that regard, you know, I think it really is important for

87
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,320
leaders in my opinion to be, to understand and to have context when making decisions. That gave me

88
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,240
perspective, okay, like we have a certain set of things that we need to do here, the gaps in the

89
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,200
organization, the types of new leaders we need to bring in. And very soon, I was able to bring in,

90
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,880
you know, several very, very capable folks in her first, my first hire was the chief product

91
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,640
officer and technology officer Teresa Dietrich, who is connected with this group now,

92
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,000
amazing leader, who's leading, you know, a product engineering and community efforts in the company,

93
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,840
Tim Miner, CRO, who's a fantastic revenue leader, who's leading all our sales efforts and

94
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,880
customer success efforts and really driving the predictable revenue path. And then since then,

95
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,520
hired several other folks to augment the existing team, so hired a new chief people officer and

96
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:10,720
a, a new CFO very recently. So all with experience of folks that have been dead on that and are able

97
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,240
to sort of take us to this next stage to the company and sort of evolution. So it's very much a

98
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,640
transformation story to get to this sort of end game, as I mentioned, with a sustainable

99
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,640
recurring revenue sort of business model on top of a force agree community.

100
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,160
So you're in a unique position of having led teams of Rackers and Stackers.

101
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,160
You got it. Yeah, I, my first, I got to say Sam, my first, you know, month or two, I constantly,

102
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,160
you know, said a mix those terms out. I was like, hey, Rackers, what are like, if people like,

103
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,920
whoa, what a man that got from it. It does rhyme, but yes.

104
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,280
Nice, nice. Little did you know after joining six months later, you'd be helping lead the

105
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:56,640
company through an event that affected many lives, many organizations, of course, the pandemic.

106
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,520
What was the impact of the pandemic on an at-stack overflow?

107
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,680
Yeah, a couple of different dimensions, right? So by the way, I joined a couple of 2019,

108
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,480
and I've been, you know, affected with your remote CEO for probably more than 75% of my time.

109
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,560
Now that comes with positive and negative. So let's just talk about both dimensions of the

110
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,800
impact of the company, right? So one is on the positive side. Let's start there. We've, you know,

111
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:29,200
seen a significant increase in the relevance of our company in this moment in time. Because,

112
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,200
you know, what we really enable is to help the world really accelerate development of technology.

113
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,280
And that's effectively what our mission is through shared knowledge or, you know, by sharing

114
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:45,040
knowledge with each other. And that has allowed numbers to really sort of go up. And if you look

115
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,480
at it, just the overall volume of the number of signups as one small proxy, you know, we have,

116
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,480
and I joined about 150,000 monthly signups on a public platform. This today, we see something

117
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,360
somewhere between 200 and 250,000 times per month. You know, again, just remember, this is 13 years

118
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,640
after we were founded. So not insignificant. It's only going up. If you look at the number of users,

119
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,240
whether they're mostly, you know, people do it somewhat sort of, they're more lurkers than they

120
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,960
are. So the contributors, the net net, we still have a lot more users. But we see that a number of

121
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,520
people on a platform increasing very steadily year-of-year. So every year, we seem to be sort of

122
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,680
increasing. And we've seen that increase quite be dramatic over the past couple of years since

123
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:31,840
the pandemic. Are the relevance of our plate products have also spirited? So our teams product,

124
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,400
staple for for teams, which I would encourage the folks in the audience. If you haven't

125
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,320
checked it out, we'll sign up for a premium account and try it out for yourselves and for your

126
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,240
own teams, which you can do on our website. You know, that is very relevant because in asynchronous

127
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,920
collaboration tool, that sits alongside synchronous collaboration tools like Slack and Microsoft

128
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,200
teams, you can just, you know, run an organization or collaborate with each other with just synchronous

129
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:03,200
tools because it's extremely, you know, debilitating for technologists. There's a lot of context

130
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,960
switching and, you know, it's prone for people are prone to burn out and those scenarios will be

131
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,200
constantly being pinged. You know, while we've been on this conversation, Sam, if I look at my

132
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,520
Slack window, I've got about seven, seven things, right? And what if, rather than me having to wait

133
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:23,200
an hour to respond to them, one if stackable for for teams is already responded automatically

134
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,480
through the Slack integration that we have by suggesting questions and answers that have already

135
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,240
been documented through our system. So that's the product that we have stackable for for teams,

136
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,640
has just one small example. But the point is that that product's relevance in the context of

137
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,800
remote work and hybrid work has gone up, you know, very significantly. So we're very much in

138
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:45,120
big enterprises making the case for why they should use our product. And then our advertising

139
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,640
business which in relevance is also sort of increased because people want quality places to showcase

140
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:55,680
their products that are helping with acceleration of technology development and all the other buzzwords

141
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,160
like visual transformation. But the idea is that we are the place, we are the place where the

142
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,480
communities for technologists exist. And that's why it's so powerful. So that's all the good stuff,

143
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,000
right? And maybe one of the good stuff had one other good point I mentioned is that we've been

144
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,200
really able to expand the locations of where we were hiring people from. For example, all the

145
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,120
leaders I mentioned to you, a bunch of them have come from California. You know, we were known as

146
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,480
a New York based startup and we've been able to really expand our aperture on the types of people

147
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,920
we hire. So those are all, you know, positive things. Now the negative things about what's happened

148
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:32,640
is that it's taken a personal toll to the, as you mentioned, you know, to people all around the

149
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,960
world. And you know, I think a lot of different issues have sort of come to the surface around the

150
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:41,840
world that we've had to sort of navigate as a company and support our staffers to make sure

151
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:48,000
they feel supported. So this is everything from, you know, personal health issues to families that

152
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,680
are affected to, you know, racial bias to, you know, all of this is sort of all has sort of, you

153
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,560
know, a company together. And that's been a very challenging time. And, you know, 2020 was

154
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,600
absolutely challenging. And, you know, we even had to sort of make certain visits in our own company

155
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,280
where we moved away from certain products, a particular product, our talent product,

156
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:12,240
those folks on job listings, we moved away from it because we just felt like that was a very sort

157
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,160
of a bus type of product, which is, you know, if you're people are hiring, you hire people are not,

158
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,960
you don't. And it was also somewhat disparate from our overall strategy. So, and that had some

159
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,960
people implications, which is unfortunate always. But the point being that it was, you know,

160
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:30,320
there's plenty of things that, you know, also, so we had to navigate the negative. But overall,

161
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,080
though, I think we're better for it. There's founders, a company where more we've, you know,

162
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,800
zoned in on what we are as a company. And that's hot.

163
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,360
So one more transition I want to ask you about. And that is the acquisition by process. How did

164
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,240
that come to be? Yeah, you know, it's somewhat organic. I think, you know, ultimately what,

165
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,160
you know, really brought us together was that process is mission statement is very, very

166
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,480
aligned with what we care about, right? So if I'm stating that mission correctly, it's like,

167
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,120
you know, process that does leading consumer internet companies and empower people in enriched

168
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,400
communities. When you think about that statement, that that speaks immediately to the heart and

169
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:16,000
soul of this company. And that's what's so exciting about, you know, really sort of working with

170
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,560
process. And for us, it's, you know, we were thinking about, it wasn't something that we sought out.

171
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,840
It was something that's sort of like I mentioned, organic, it just sort of happened with the sort

172
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,200
of the series of events. But we've always been approached by companies throughout our history,

173
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,200
right? And the question was around, who was somebody that we could to the partner with for

174
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,520
the long term, who could help think big and really understood the potential of this company

175
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,280
and the ability to go 10x relative to where we are today and this, this diamond, the rough type of

176
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,560
approach. And really, who has an international and global perspective that matches the global

177
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,960
community that we have, which is literally from all around the world, right? And then this

178
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:59,200
edtech angle, which you know, with Larry Elk, who's the CEO of the Edtech portfolio, was a very

179
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:05,120
interesting element for us because if you think about what we do, we implicitly allow people to

180
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,360
learn, you know, technologists and developers to learn. And the edtech angle is very exciting because

181
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,280
learning does start with a question generally speaking, you know, people really, that's how we

182
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,680
typically learn versus just going, you know, with more traditional ways. And so this huge focus

183
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,800
on the most important community emerging markets, international orientation and edtech,

184
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,440
with the reasons why we ultimately saw that this is really, you know, I think a powerful combination

185
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,640
for us to work in a long term sense, but by thinking really big.

186
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,880
And kind of on that point of community, you know, let's transition from the transition

187
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:48,080
questions and talk a little bit about how the company thinks about community and collaboration

188
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:53,760
and enabling these things at the scale of what you operate. Yeah, so I mean, ultimately, like I've

189
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:58,960
mentioned Sam, I think hybrid workforces are here to stay, right? And to like think that is not

190
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:04,560
going away any time, even the pandemic disappears. I think there's so many studies now done that

191
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:10,480
employees really, really appreciate the flexibility of, you know, being able to

192
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:18,480
and reduce that commute hours, you know, two hours to, you know, zero, and also be having the flexibility

193
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,240
to then to sort of have a little bit more control about, you know, their balance and their work life

194
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,320
and so on. So I think by the same time, there's a very important, you know, kind of, it's important

195
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:33,040
to understand the impact of synchronous communication and collaboration, unless it's sort of asynchronous

196
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,920
collaboration. And so it's important as we sort of balance out things like burnout, et cetera.

197
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:43,200
So ultimately, you know, when we think about how do we scale, you know, this community,

198
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:49,360
I think a lot of it has to do with making sure that, you know, we are solving very specific

199
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,520
problems to empower team members to share knowledge, you know, both actively and reactively.

200
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,360
And you know, most of the sort of knowledge management tools that sort of exist today

201
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,800
solve one or the other. I mean, be keys and file storage are focused on more like

202
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,160
proactive knowledge sharing. And so information is likely lacking and there's offer, there's always

203
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,440
they sort of offer no real way to foster collaboration and things like email and chat are very

204
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,040
sort of instantaneous. So we believe that, you know, there's too much reliance on one person. So we

205
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,280
really, we really believe that it's an opportunity to build communities through our products and our

206
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:29,600
public community, which is sort of a fundamental way in which you can do that. And so that's,

207
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,320
you know, I think ultimately, these communities, when we think about the kind of the focus of how

208
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,640
we want to scale, we think about it as the external community and we talk about internal communities.

209
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,160
And the external communities is public platform and the public community and then these internal

210
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,880
community communities is through stack overflow teams. And then we also have something in between

211
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:56,000
that we call collectives on stack overflow, which is sort of in between. It's a sort of a pseudo

212
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,280
public pseudo private space on stack overflow, where companies like technology companies like a

213
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:07,040
Google or a GitLab, et cetera, or even open source communities like Roland or Google language can

214
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,800
build their communities on top of stack overflow and live over the world garden. So they can have a

215
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:18,320
sort of a sort of a very sort of a hyper focused space on their technologies to engage with

216
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,600
their power users and so on. So we really believe, and as you know, Teresa, she thought of,

217
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,600
I would say creating sort of this sort of link between public and private and having sort of

218
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,640
that the pebbles between those sort of, those sort of, you know, in the valley sort of speak,

219
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,200
is sort of how we are approaching skating out these products. And all three of them are very

220
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,200
relevant, you know, it's public community hybrid as well as private.

221
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,760
And so what, what's the relationship between stack overflow, the company and the various

222
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:56,000
communities that you sewer? Is it a very hands-on one? Is it very distributed? What's the governance

223
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,160
model? How do you think about all of the kind of management challenges that come along with growing

224
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:08,000
communities? Yeah, I don't, you know, so ultimately, you know, we have a few principles that we operate

225
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,640
with to make sure that we are managing our relationship with the community in a productive way.

226
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,480
So ultimately, I just give you all all role principles, right? When we think about communities,

227
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,040
and I've spoken about the subject a few times, one is we want to focus on a shared identity,

228
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:28,560
a really big problem that everybody wants to work on together, and we have that here with stack.

229
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,960
Secondly, to create sort of sufficient incentives for people to contribute and participate

230
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,840
in that system. And in our case, it's about, you know, really helping out your fellow developers,

231
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,400
about showcasing your knowledge as the best Python programmer in the world, being recognized for it,

232
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:48,800
and so on. Thirdly, it's about building with the community versus for the community. And that's

233
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,760
important because, you know, as a company, you can't just sort of impose a bunch of rules

234
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,480
into a very large group of people and say, just follow this, because that's not really inclusive,

235
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,760
plus it's not really not really going to have the buy-in to be able to do it. So it's a

236
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:07,840
more common sense when you're trying to operate at the scale to really have them as equal partners,

237
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,320
then meaning the broader public community, and you need representation to be able to do that. And it's

238
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,880
a very, very sort of, you know, sort of closely sort of, and sort of thoughtfully sort of a managed

239
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,000
sort of process to make sure that they feel very included. And fourth, it's about breaking down silos

240
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,920
and making sure we build bridges across, you know, these various communities, and we're doing that

241
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:32,160
with those products that I mentioned here. And ultimately, that creates all these virtuous

242
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:38,400
cycles across these various paid products and these public, public platforms. So specifically,

243
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,680
as it relates to community and how we engage with them, there are many different mechanisms,

244
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:49,920
you know, we've hired a really strong VP of community, formerly a dreaded Philippe Bodette,

245
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:57,120
who is, who really manages now that entire effort, who is fantastic. And the ideas for us to

246
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,400
partner hand-in-hand through our moderator mechanisms, through by listening to the community,

247
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,200
and there are multiple mechanisms to do that. We have a meta user base. We have our new

248
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,400
pre-news letter that we send out. And so we're constantly making sure that

249
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,120
we are partnering very deeply with users to make sure that they feel as much of a vested

250
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,200
interest when you make changes on the website. So it is definitely an obligation. It's not,

251
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,680
it's easier said than done. It takes up quite a bit of effort on our team's part. And that's

252
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:32,080
very unique about this company, but it is very possible because we have a very passionate group

253
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,400
of people that care about this big problem that we're going to solve. And do you see those

254
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:43,600
challenges that you've referenced as being unique to the technical communities, or is it,

255
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,400
you know, they comment across all different types of communities?

256
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,520
Yeah, it's a good question. I think they're just different, right? I mean,

257
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,000
everybody has their own problems. I think that, or challenges to sort of overcome,

258
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,640
the goodies that we're not a social network, right? Even though we have collaboration at the

259
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,680
heart of what we do, social networks have their own set of issues. At least for us, we're dealing

260
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:11,280
with very objectives, information, and it's not subjective in for the most part, right? Like,

261
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,120
technical information is either you have the right answer on how to solve a problem,

262
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,640
and you have an incorrect answer. And that could sometimes come across as harsh,

263
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,400
Sam, to be candid, right? Because it is, it is very sort of, it's right or wrong. And I think

264
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,960
that we are also trying to focus on that effort is to make sure how do we, how do people have more

265
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,360
of a sort of software landing spot so they get used to this sort of very right or wrong type of

266
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,880
approach on the platform? And again, let's not forget that that that approach has lasted for 13

267
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:44,720
years. You know, many companies have existed and died over the past decade during that time,

268
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,600
but they're always afraid of the due to make. So, so this community of technical folks,

269
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,240
yes, they can breathe, you know, I think they can be, they, you know, I think as all technical

270
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,800
folks are like we're all technical folks, we can be skeptical about a particular approach,

271
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,400
because it's always an, you know, an engineering answer that may be better or, you know, and so on.

272
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,320
But that that skepticism ultimately generates the right answer, and that's what people appreciate,

273
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,840
because they're able to solve their problem when they have, when they have an issue, right? And

274
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:19,360
that's what's powerful about it. And let's transition to talking a little bit about data and AI

275
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:26,160
at Stack Overflow, just to kind of start things off, you know, where would you characterize Stack Overflow

276
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:33,600
as being in its AI journey? Yeah, I would characterize it as Fannie, uh, Fannie Neeson, like, you know,

277
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,760
and Philly, Lily in our evolution. Now, having said that, I will say that, you know, uh, Teresa

278
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,200
are Chief Keeploffs, uh, and, you know, and on her team, she's now hired, uh, Michael Forey,

279
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,120
who's just an excellent, uh, you know, uh, data platform leader that he just came on board from

280
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,480
Capital One. And so we've made a very deliberate, uh, decision to sort of invest in this space,

281
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,520
because, you know, again, like I mentioned at the top of the, this conversation, you know, we have a,

282
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,360
tremendous amount of data that we have, right? That's the, you know, the, we want to provide

283
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,840
of data that's available. The public to use and the 70 terabytes that we ultimately have on all

284
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,760
sorts of dimensions. So the, so we are very much the goal, um, you know, and I've spent some time

285
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,000
with Forey's and Michael, is that you want to empower people in the company and ultimately

286
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,560
our community and our customers to be able to just really sort of self-serve and make the most

287
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:32,240
of the acts of the data that we have, which is amazing, right? Once a year, we do a survey, uh,

288
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,840
which falls about 100,000 people this past year's 85,000 people to talk about developer trends,

289
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,240
right? And that's our sacral flow developer survey that comes out every year. And that's great.

290
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,360
It has a lot of great insights, but it's a very discreet once a year type of effort. Why not

291
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:54,080
enable people where that's employees or beyond have that sort of insight on a regular, on-demand

292
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,880
basis? That, that'd be very powerful for us to do. And so where we are, as we were very early in

293
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,200
establishing sort of the phases of rollout and, you know, we're, you know, we're very much in the

294
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,120
process of determining, you know, establishing just, you know, all the things that you expect,

295
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,240
right? A data lake and a training regime, uh, we're evaluating things like Azure Blob storage,

296
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:17,520
and, you know, Snowflake and Databricks, uh, and even sort of some abstracting tools like

297
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,480
Data Robot, uh, and all these sort of, uh, certain evaluation is happening very, very, so by the

298
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:28,000
early level, uh, beyond that, of course, phase two will all be about the layout and actual data

299
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,880
team with, you know, actual data scientists, then ultimately, of course, would be things like

300
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,720
optimizing for latency and, and turn around time. So we're fairly early in that journey sound,

301
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,360
despite all the data we collected, and the team, uh, so far over the past seven years has,

302
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,840
done a lot of things, uh, despite not having all those sort of best-in-class type of things in

303
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:54,000
place, right? Uh, and, and, and once one example of this is, we even built something called the

304
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,920
unfriendly robot, our data science data team did, by going, and by building a very, very

305
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,960
fairly early stage AIML type of capability that basically goes and scans out all our

306
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,520
stackable for stack-a-change websites and flags where there are somewhat, you know,

307
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,560
un- tasteful comments, uh, to a question, uh, and so that is important for us again for,

308
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:19,360
you know, for novices, etc. So they have a good experience. So that is one example of how,

309
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,680
you know, despite not having the full foundation, both out, we are still able to do powerful

310
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:30,720
things. We've talked a bit about the, the main data set, this text data set that you have,

311
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,160
are there other data sets, uh, that, uh, you think are, are potentially interesting for the company?

312
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:42,800
Yeah, I think, you know, the, the data that we collect is, um, is, you know, it's quite,

313
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:48,240
it's quite robust and has, you know, there's so much opportunity to sort of analyze it, right?

314
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,360
If you think about what we're collecting, we do collect structured data like, uh, you know,

315
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,960
users and, you know, you know, it's kind of like, you know, all those sort of things are pros

316
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,960
and who's logged in and, you know, when they logged in and so on and so forth. The number of

317
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,600
questions are asked and answered and so on. But the vast majority of what we do collect is unstructured.

318
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,640
So, you know, free-form texts and out questions and answers and comments and tags and, you know,

319
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,360
it's sort of the obvious examples. Uh, we also have things like network graphs where we are able to

320
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,120
almost like, you know, if you think about like this sort of fluorescent liquid that goes and tracks,

321
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,400
exactly what happens when somebody experiences stack, you know, a user search for a particular item,

322
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,920
they look at then question one, question two, they copy code from question three, then they post it

323
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:35,520
another question, you know, X minutes later. So like, all that is very, very, um, you know, that's

324
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,840
powerful. So I think that sort of, and then of course we have code snippets beyond just text data.

325
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,480
So there's, there's a lot that we capture that, uh, and the commentary and the uploads and

326
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,240
downloads and, you know, all that is great context and gives a really sort of good, uh, sense of

327
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:55,120
the why, like, why are people actually doing what they're doing? And that's very rich for us to be

328
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:02,240
able to sort of grow and analyze. Um, and so that's, that's what's exciting. Nice, nice. Uh, you mentioned

329
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:09,760
the, uh, the unfriendly bot slot. Um, are you, uh, can you tell us a little bit more about that

330
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,160
project and kind of how it evolved, how it's used that kind of thing? Yeah, you know, we should,

331
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,320
we should have a microphone for review a deep dive on it. But I would say, you know,

332
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:24,080
ultimately, it basically leverages machine learning to scan our public platform, uh, for unfriendly

333
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,880
comments and the sort of, that can be sort of addressed and eliminated, right? So it's sort of a,

334
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:36,880
it's a fairly early stage, um, sort of, um, effort by us to make sure that our, our platform is

335
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,760
welcoming to the next generation of coders. So one of the criticisms of stack is that, hey,

336
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,560
as a new, as a new user, it's quite harsh of an environment because, you know, I'm asking you

337
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,720
a very simple question and I thought, shot down by somebody on the platform because they thought

338
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,720
it was not a great question. And the answer that, you know, that, that system has existed

339
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,160
and to make sure that the right answer and the right questions are asked the quality of information

340
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,160
very high. And that was a trade off that was made as part of a principle of setting up the platform.

341
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:07,440
But how, but this friendly robot is mostly, it's there to sort of improve the experience of

342
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,040
the average user, the novice user. At the same time, we are evaluating other software landing zones,

343
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:16,880
like, you know, a place where people can just sort of get guidance and get an onboard,

344
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,480
a lot more sort of an friendly environment and try out a few things before they actually do

345
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,800
mask their first question. So they don't really know if the harsh experience. So it gives us a

346
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,280
inability to address the issue, perhaps in some cases, addressing the symptom,

347
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:33,920
in some cases, addressing, uh, you know, sort of a more of a short term fix. So that's,

348
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,600
that hopefully gives you a little more context and we'll try to do that out of it. And earlier,

349
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,680
you mentioned, uh, in the context of the team's product integration with Slack and the product

350
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,080
being able to suggest answers. Is that also, uh, kind of an ML powered bot?

351
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,480
And yes, in that also, so with teams as an example, you know, we, uh, capabilities very

352
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,200
powerful in a couple of dimensions. So one is, you know, when people search for a question,

353
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,080
they can do that on stackable for teams, they can be up and by the way, we have companies like

354
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,840
Microsoft and Bloomberg and extensify and you name it by a big, big enterprise and, and

355
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,800
high growth startups that are using our product. Microsoft has over 100,000 users on stackable

356
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:22,880
for teams. So it's a fantastic tool, uh, and capable of products for enterprises to, to use,

357
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,080
uh, to collaborate asynchronously. Now, as far, why it works so well is, you know, it is,

358
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,560
if somebody asks a question, how do I do this on AWS within a company or within Microsoft apps

359
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:37,280
are asking, how do I do this on Microsoft Azure? You know, the question is, even when they ask

360
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:43,600
that within MS teams, uh, which is integrated with stackable for teams, uh, it's going to prompt

361
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,680
the user with three other questions that sound similar. Hey, like your colleague asks this

362
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,000
question already, you know what I mean? And so don't ask another question to just add to the,

363
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,080
add to the noise. Go look at the answer that was documented six months ago by somebody else,

364
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,440
and you're a brand new employee to Microsoft will check this question out, you know,

365
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,800
or when the new employee comes in, they're getting a package of 50 questions and answers and a bunch

366
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,520
of long form articles as we call them long form content, uh, called articles that gives them

367
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:13,600
and how do you onboard into Microsoft Azure at Microsoft as an example, right? Or, or could you

368
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,400
use a tool and so on? So those prompts and, you know, uh, it's another example of how

369
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,960
ML is fueling question prompts. Say listen, you know, here's another question that may be similar

370
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,680
to what we're asking and so on. So we are, we are slowly incorporating those sort of features.

371
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,560
One of the point I mentioned to you is, um, you know, our search capability, there's a lot that we

372
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:37,920
could do that because again, we have access to just a ton of information. We launched something

373
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:43,040
called Unified Search, uh, this past year where, uh, somebody asked me a question again,

374
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:48,000
that we're using that Microsoft example. How do I do some Microsoft Azure? They could get five

375
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,640
answers from the public community that is relevant that we have about 250,000 questions on Microsoft

376
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,680
Azure and the public community on Stack Oldflow. And then it would also present maybe three answers

377
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:03,040
from just a private, just within Microsoft, something that's specific that is confidential to Microsoft,

378
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:07,520
that's also presented as part of that ancestor. So you're getting to this robust private and public

379
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:14,960
combination. So I can imagine there's a lot more to do there with, uh, with ML and AI. Got it, got it.

380
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:21,120
How folks in our audience, most want to know is what do you see as the single most impactful

381
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,680
potential use case for AI at Stack Overflow? Wow. Okay. I think this is, uh, this,

382
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:34,400
it's a powerful question. I think that for us, the amount of data that we collect across the

383
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:41,760
owners, the data we have access to and, uh, all we know about a trend before trend is actually

384
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,800
formalized, you know, and so we don't really fully sort of, um, we don't really sort of realize

385
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:54,080
that in the context of sharing that information with all the relevant people. So I think this,

386
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,200
for example, I mentioned previously, doing a once a year developer survey to then sort of figure

387
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,640
out that in what's spelled is the top language, uh, that made its way to the top of the list this

388
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,360
year is not like, you know, it's not a, yes, it's a discrete moment in time that we're calculating

389
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:15,280
that. But for people to know about all the ways in which technology is changing and technology

390
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,400
is changing very rapidly. The reason why we have so much innovation on new scripting languages and

391
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,920
and programming languages, languages that, you know, there are inefficiencies with each one,

392
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,960
you know, constantly optimizing for some set of variables. And they will have to always continue

393
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,360
to exist, right? So you add VMs in the early days, now you have serverless and you have even

394
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,560
beyond that, right? So the point is that it's a continuous evolution. And I think the ability to

395
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,440
empower developers and technologists and people that are in the detail on daily basis to say,

396
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,000
there is a metal weight to do this, you know, or, you know, what that answer may be outdated. And,

397
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,840
you know, we hear as a more relevant answer. All those things, I think, are capabilities that

398
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:59,120
are AI and ML tool set in the future could help power and give people insight a lot earlier.

399
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,760
You know, on the topic of trends in the survey, are there particularly interesting or surprising

400
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,320
trends that have popped up as you've done the survey over the past couple of years?

401
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,920
Yeah, I think, you know, some of the, some of the trends are interesting, especially as it relates

402
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,840
to sort of the future of work and how people sort of, you know, how, what people appreciate going

403
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:31,120
forward versus previously, I think, I think 70% of developers based on a survey are learning

404
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,680
in new technology at least once a year, which is, you know, fascinating to us, which is like,

405
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,600
wow, this is, you know, this is ultimately sort of a learning, engineers would love to learn,

406
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:44,720
we know that, but we didn't realize 70% of developers do that. It's like a very high number.

407
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,400
You know, 60% of these developers are learning to code from online resources, which is, you know,

408
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,280
kind of a, a hat tip to process in the tech portfolio and ultimately what our role in that.

409
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,720
And ultimately, I think people also really want to make sure that they,

410
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,320
you know, have the flexibility, I don't have exact stat, but, you know, in terms of like,

411
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,520
their ability to have a hybrid work environment, the ability to have flexibility in their work,

412
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,360
you know, there's this grand resignation that you're hearing about, you know, in the industry.

413
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,200
And a lot of that is being, perhaps is, you know, people are making choices based on, you know,

414
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,960
do they first want to, they're working for mission driven organizations, so they,

415
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,920
they respect and they care about the mission. And secondly, do they have control in this sort of

416
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,200
world that seems to reduce people's uncertainty? Do they have more control over their sort of,

417
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,080
you know, their, their professional lives? And I think that having the flexibility and hybrid

418
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:45,360
work, et cetera, is sort of another sort of very interesting spike that we've seen in, in our surveys.

419
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:53,680
Nice. We've recently seen some interesting evolution in the industry kind of around AI-based

420
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,200
code generation, like open AI and GitHub collaborated on a tool called co-pilot.

421
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:07,440
Yep. You know, there are, you know, what do you think about the, you know, the future of

422
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:14,000
code generation or those kinds of AI models and stack overflows potential role in that kind of thing?

423
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,840
Yeah, I think then, you know, there's a lot of potential with those, those elements, right?

424
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:26,000
So co-pilot's an interesting thing, you know, it obviously uses a lot of data in the public sphere

425
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,640
as it sort of, there's a sort of recommend piece of code. It doesn't come, but, you know,

426
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,440
it's early days is what I would sort of say, right? There's always a, you know, we've all read

427
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,160
the feedback on, you know, perhaps it's sort of it's not accurate enough for its propagating errors

428
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,680
and, you know, those are the sort of downsides. But I'm very sort of positive about the direction

429
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,000
in that people are constantly looking at me. There's no difference in what I mentioned previously.

430
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,440
There's always this thing of how do you improve efficiency? How do you remove context switching,

431
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,640
right? And for developers, it's important. And if you can sort of spoon feed as much of the

432
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:05,840
funding foundation as possible, that's pretty powerful. But also comes with downsides. You can't

433
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:10,320
just blindly sort of assume what you're, what's being generated is going to work because then you just,

434
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,280
you've got a bunch of code that you just don't understand and that may have unintended consequences.

435
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,280
So there's a lot more, I think, work to do around training those models, increasing the accuracy,

436
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,640
making sure the unintended consequences are less keeping things like diversity, you know, through

437
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,360
in designs that have been mined, you know, and all those sort of elements, it's a multi,

438
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,560
it's a very complex problem. And I think in general, I think it's a good move because you obviously

439
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,920
constantly want to automate and, you know, we're optimistic and we believe we can play a bigger role

440
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,000
with that as well because of the amount of data and the richness of the data that we have.

441
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,200
And that's very much our sacrifice of a team's product is meant to do that in many ways, to suggest

442
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:56,800
the right, right answers, the right time to people to get the unstuck, ultimately, right in any

443
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:03,600
share. Yeah, have me played a bit with co-pilot, at least in its current state, I'd almost rather have

444
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:10,000
some automatic integration between Stack Overflow and the IDE that just tells me all the times that

445
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,840
the mistake I'm about to make has been made and what the solution is. Yeah, indeed, you know,

446
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:20,320
that gives you more control and definitely we have we're in the process of thinking through

447
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:26,240
our roadmap for 2022 and IDs have sort of come up a few times, integrations with IDs. And so

448
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,040
I'll take that back to our product team. Yeah, nice. And so maybe to wrap things up,

449
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:41,600
tell us a little bit about the kind of, you know, future state of a Stack Overflow and MLAI

450
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:47,440
enabled Stack Overflow in the context of this process acquisition, like what's possible,

451
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,120
kind of given where we are today and what you're looking at with the business.

452
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,160
Yeah, so I think that, you know, ultimately, like I mentioned, we have Stack Overflow, the

453
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,080
public platform. This is massive platform that's access-bounded million people. We have Stack Overflow

454
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,360
Teams, that is the private version of that public platform that helps organizations like Microsoft,

455
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,640
LoomBud and so on, really have, you know, a synchronous collaboration, increased efficiency

456
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,240
into build faster. And then we have our advertising business, which is, you know, which is called

457
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,040
region relevance, which has things like Android branding and collectives on Stack Overflow and so on.

458
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:27,520
So ultimately with something like Teams, we want to, we are in the community building business,

459
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,440
that's what we do, right? So we are making sure that Teams is the de facto, asynchronous

460
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,600
collaboration technology for technologies and knowledge workers from all around the world.

461
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:43,280
We have a very U.S. centric customer base in Teams today. And with our partnership with

462
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,920
Process, we expect it to really expand internationally to replicate that. So you'll see us do that

463
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,680
on the boot of market side in the coming year and years. So that is that's one sort of big

464
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,240
element of it. Secondly, you know, we want to get even more deeply integrated into the

465
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,440
technology sort of workflow as an extension of the public Stack Overflow experience. So we know that

466
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,760
every developer goes to Stack Overflow, let's say for the most part. So the question is like,

467
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,440
how do we create connective tissue between that public platform experience and the private product

468
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:18,880
to make sure that that ecosystem of products is like a one, right? Because that is a, that is a

469
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,520
that's a poor product or a must-have product that nobody can live without. And so you will see us do a

470
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,480
lot more building that connective tissue between the public platform, products like collectives,

471
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,720
which sits sort of in between, as I mentioned, allowing companies to build their communities on

472
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,560
Stack Overflow and then Stack Overflow for teams and private organizations. And then ultimately,

473
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,040
it's all about, again, making sure that we're building very thriving communities. So, you know,

474
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,760
building knowledge and resources that are resilient and evergreen and capturing questions and

475
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,800
summing up answers in the flow of communication through these sort of other synchronous tools,

476
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,960
like Stack and Microsoft Teams, to prevent any sort of context switching and really enabling

477
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,600
distributed teams to share and recognize and really sort of enable this rapid learning for

478
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:09,120
people within organizations in an increasingly sort of distributed sort of world of working and

479
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,760
sort of remote sort of environment. And so really ultimately, we want to be able to create

480
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,280
this culture of learning so that teams can upscale and scale and really do that very quickly

481
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,760
for the future humanity. So that's the, that's why we're going.

482
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:31,760
Awesome. Well, Percent, thanks so much. It was wonderful chatting with you. Thank you, Sam.
