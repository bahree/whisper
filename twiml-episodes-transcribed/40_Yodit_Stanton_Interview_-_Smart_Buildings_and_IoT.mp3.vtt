And now about today's show.

01:52.280 --> 01:57.920
After a brief hiatus, the industrial AI series is making its triumphant return.

01:57.920 --> 02:06.120
Our guest this week is Yodet Stanton, a self-described data nerd and the founder and CEO of OpenSensors.io.

02:06.120 --> 02:11.360
Open sensors is a real-time data exchange for IoT, the Internet of Things, that enables

02:11.360 --> 02:16.240
anyone to publish and subscribe to real-time open data in order to build higher order

02:16.240 --> 02:19.960
smart systems and better understand the world around them.

02:19.960 --> 02:24.920
Our discussion focuses on smart buildings and how they're enabled by IoT and machine

02:24.920 --> 02:26.720
learning techniques.

02:26.720 --> 02:30.600
Before we jump into the interview, a brief word from our sponsors.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.120
You've heard me mention Bonsai before.

02:33.120 --> 02:38.960
Bonsai offers an AI platform that lets enterprises build and deploy intelligent systems.

02:38.960 --> 02:43.840
If you're trying to build AI-powered applications focused on optimizing and controlling the industrial

02:43.840 --> 02:47.800
systems in your enterprise, you should take a look at what they're up to.

02:47.800 --> 02:51.640
They've got a unique approach to building AI models that lets you use high-level code

02:51.640 --> 02:57.120
to model the real-world concepts in your application, automatically generate train and evaluate

02:57.120 --> 03:02.840
low-level models for your project using techniques like reinforcement learning, and easily integrate

03:02.840 --> 03:06.880
those models into your applications and systems using APIs.

03:06.880 --> 03:10.720
You can check them out at bonds.ai and definitely let them know.

03:10.720 --> 03:13.520
You appreciate their support of the podcast.

03:13.520 --> 03:20.520
I'm excited to announce a new sponsor this week, and that is wise.io and GE Digital.

03:20.520 --> 03:26.520
Wise.io was among the very first companies I began following in what I called the machine-learning

03:26.520 --> 03:30.520
platform space back in 2012 and 2013.

03:30.520 --> 03:35.520
I've since interviewed co-founder Josh Bloom here on the show and many of you have been

03:35.520 --> 03:44.520
in the company's subsequent acquisition by GE Digital.

03:44.520 --> 03:50.520
At GE Digital, the Wise.io team is focused on creating technology and solutions to enable

03:50.520 --> 03:56.520
advanced capabilities for the industrial internet of things, making infrastructure more intelligent

03:56.520 --> 04:00.520
and advancing the industry's critical to the world we live in.

04:00.520 --> 04:05.520
I want to give a hearty thanks and shout out to the team at Wise.io and GE Digital for

04:05.520 --> 04:09.520
supporting my industrial AI research and this podcast series.

04:09.520 --> 04:13.520
Of course, you can check them out at Wise.io.

04:13.520 --> 04:18.520
All right, on to the show.

04:18.520 --> 04:32.520
All right, everyone, I am on the line with Yodet Stanton. Yodet is a self-described data

04:32.520 --> 04:37.520
nerd, founder and chief unicorn of OpenCensors.io.

04:37.520 --> 04:41.520
Yodet, welcome to this week in machine-learning and AI.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.520
Thank you, Sam.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.520
I'm really excited to be here and thank you for inviting me.

04:45.520 --> 04:48.520
I am super excited for this conversation.

04:48.520 --> 04:52.520
Now, the listeners don't know, but we've known each other for a little bit having first met

04:52.520 --> 04:57.520
in London and then I think the next time we saw each other was in Barcelona.

04:57.520 --> 05:03.520
And so I've been following the progress of your company, OpenCensors, and I'm super excited

05:03.520 --> 05:05.520
about what you're doing there.

05:05.520 --> 05:12.520
And I think I'm particularly excited about having you on to share some of what folks need to know about

05:12.520 --> 05:18.520
the intersection between machine-learning and AI and the Internet of Things.

05:18.520 --> 05:22.520
So why don't we get started by having you tell folks a little bit about your background.

05:22.520 --> 05:27.520
You have done a number of things in a variety of different industries and I think folks

05:27.520 --> 05:30.520
will find that context interesting.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.520
Okay, thank you.

05:31.520 --> 05:40.520
So I've been, I guess, officially a programmer probably for about, gosh, for about 17 years now.

05:40.520 --> 05:44.520
My background is computer science. I did a degree in computer science.

05:44.520 --> 05:46.520
I also liked quite a lot of math.

05:46.520 --> 05:56.520
So I ended up working in what was the only available kind of computer science plus math kind of industry,

05:56.520 --> 06:01.520
which was in finance and investment banking.

06:01.520 --> 06:11.520
And most of my early career were sitting on trading floors with either kind of equity traders

06:11.520 --> 06:18.520
and algorithm traders and writing a lot of the exchange connectivity, supporting the exchanges,

06:18.520 --> 06:22.520
and also some of the kind of massive machine learning for quant trading.

06:22.520 --> 06:27.520
So that's really where my love of data came out of and was born.

06:27.520 --> 06:34.520
And in weird ways, what I do now is actually very similar because if you think of IoT,

06:34.520 --> 06:38.520
there's lots of small messages moving around really, really fast.

06:38.520 --> 06:44.520
You're adding some level of intelligence to plus moving data, which on its own,

06:44.520 --> 06:50.520
you know, one IoT data point isn't that interesting, but on aggregate, it's hugely interesting.

06:50.520 --> 06:55.520
So I haven't moved that far even though, you know, when I describe it,

06:55.520 --> 07:00.520
it seems like worlds apart, but technically it's not.

07:00.520 --> 07:01.520
Wow.

07:01.520 --> 07:04.520
Tell us a little bit about the company Open Sensors.

07:04.520 --> 07:05.520
What are you up to there?

07:05.520 --> 07:11.520
So Open Sensors has been a company that started as very much as a side project.

07:11.520 --> 07:17.520
So we've been around for about three years, just maybe three and a half years.

07:17.520 --> 07:25.520
The initial thing was I was working as a consultant and people probably about five, four or five years ago

07:25.520 --> 07:28.520
will say, oh, I have all the streaming data.

07:28.520 --> 07:34.520
We were working in the kind of the early days of Hadoop and kind of this big data world at the time.

07:34.520 --> 07:39.520
And I saw more and more requests for help me do something on streaming data.

07:39.520 --> 07:43.520
So initially it was just like experimenting with storm.

07:43.520 --> 07:46.520
What would happen when you start kind of streaming a lot of data sets?

07:46.520 --> 07:47.520
Okay.

07:47.520 --> 07:52.520
Adding some kind of, you know, doing stuff on data flows and so forth.

07:52.520 --> 07:58.520
At the same time, I also started thinking, well, a lot of this hardware is going to be deployed

07:58.520 --> 08:01.520
and people are going to want to reuse a lot of this data.

08:01.520 --> 08:05.520
So what would happen if I started publishing, you know, data from my environment?

08:05.520 --> 08:10.520
I had a particular interest in air quality data because my daughter had asthma and I thought,

08:10.520 --> 08:15.520
well, let's kind of look at the correlations between her attacks and air quality levels.

08:15.520 --> 08:21.520
So that was, that was very much like not, it was not a job that I was trying to create.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.520
It was just intellectual challenges.

08:23.520 --> 08:26.520
I don't think I heard that part of the story.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.520
Was it originally open sensors.org?

08:28.520 --> 08:29.520
It was always.io.

08:29.520 --> 08:33.520
It was just, we were just having so much fun.

08:33.520 --> 08:40.520
And then over time, I could see, you know, IoT was going to be a thing.

08:40.520 --> 08:46.520
And then obviously once, once we started, we started saying, hey, we're doing this at meetups and stuff

08:46.520 --> 08:49.520
and then people started using it.

08:49.520 --> 08:54.520
And then we got like some customers and thought, oh, I guess this is a company now.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.520
So started hiring people.

08:56.520 --> 09:00.520
There was no, there was no method to this madness.

09:00.520 --> 09:07.520
So when you say people started using it, what exactly was it at the time and how has it evolved?

09:07.520 --> 09:12.520
So it at the time was anyone can use it to publish data.

09:12.520 --> 09:18.520
So we have real-time data exchange is the kind of the initial, the initial concept

09:18.520 --> 09:24.520
where any community member can just make a project around something that they cared about.

09:24.520 --> 09:28.520
Usually it was around air quality because I guess maybe I was in that world.

09:28.520 --> 09:32.520
I eventually started becoming around water quality.

09:32.520 --> 09:40.520
Nowadays, the sensors have got quite sophisticated, I have to say, the initial prototypes are now industrial.

09:40.520 --> 09:47.520
And then what we started seeing was that a lot of our customers were coming from the building space.

09:47.520 --> 09:53.520
The actual customers, the way that works is that they don't publish their data.

09:53.520 --> 09:57.520
It's open, it's private, and they pay us some hosting charges.

09:57.520 --> 10:02.520
And we started kind of going in and saying, well, why is this?

10:02.520 --> 10:06.520
And we understood actually there's some fundamental problems in managing real estate.

10:06.520 --> 10:14.520
And it also combines a lot of air quality data because people care about how good is this space.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.520
And people spend a lot of time indoors.

10:16.520 --> 10:24.520
So there's a lot of impact to productivity and health and so forth within inside the building.

10:24.520 --> 10:31.520
And the interesting thing that's coming out is nowadays because we carry so much outside air quality data,

10:31.520 --> 10:39.520
what some of the larger landlords are starting to think about is how do I understand the performance of my HVAC systems

10:39.520 --> 10:43.520
by comparing the indoor air quality to the outdoor air quality and so forth.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.520
Interesting.

10:44.520 --> 10:53.520
So it's all very organic, but we try to follow the pains versus the IoT hype.

10:53.520 --> 10:57.520
So who knows where this is all going to go.

10:57.520 --> 11:03.520
And I remember I think the last time we spoke, you were doing a lot with agricultural data as well.

11:03.520 --> 11:10.520
Yeah, I think so agriculture is that so we have a couple of customers that are an architect.

11:10.520 --> 11:17.520
And again, I think the theme is that what people tend to do is they tend to combine multiple data sets.

11:17.520 --> 11:24.520
So IoT is actually like the individual data sets are really not interesting like knowing a humidity of a soil.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.520
Okay, it's one data point, but it's one.

11:27.520 --> 11:35.520
I think this is this is late no random moment, but it's when you combine a lot of data that you get very interesting outputs.

11:35.520 --> 11:44.520
So when you start combining like the water kind of humidity with with weather data with kind of water quality data and so forth,

11:44.520 --> 11:47.520
you get some really, really, really interesting out.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.520
But I'm still I still don't know.

11:49.520 --> 11:53.520
I don't think we kind of defined what IoT data analytics looks like.

11:53.520 --> 11:59.520
I think it's still, you know, kind of version one, both from our perspective and the industry perspective.

11:59.520 --> 12:03.520
So yeah, it's work in progress.

12:03.520 --> 12:19.520
Can you give us examples of the kinds of insights or the types of results that really characterize that observation for you that when you combine lots of different types of data that that's where the real value is.

12:19.520 --> 12:26.520
Yeah, so I mean, so the industry that we're working mostly in is within within buildings.

12:26.520 --> 12:34.520
So smart buildings is the general term. I don't really like that term, but anyway, let's kind of go with it.

12:34.520 --> 12:45.520
And so for a lot of building owners, I mean, they spend so buildings are the second largest cost that they have for most kind of organizations, you know, your people,

12:45.520 --> 13:01.520
people, cost is, I think JLL have her square foot. They say you spend generally $300 per square foot for people 30 for your rent and maybe three for utilities and so forth.

13:01.520 --> 13:10.520
And a lot of people are saying, well, how much real estate do I actually need and how like what's my footprint?

13:10.520 --> 13:23.520
What does it need today? And at the same time, how do I make it so that it's a nice place to work because you don't want to have, you don't want to pack too many people in a space because you it becomes really noisy.

13:23.520 --> 13:39.520
And you know, the CO2 level go really high and so forth. So how do I create that balance between efficient use of space, but also kind of not necessarily hitting the productivity of people and just making it a crappy place to be.

13:39.520 --> 13:50.520
And that's a really hard line. And that's when you need to measure obviously you need to know, you know, the noise levels, the light level CO2 levels high CO2 makes people sleepy.

13:50.520 --> 14:03.520
But you also need to measure the footfall and the trends of both in order to actually kind of weave the best path and kind of think through what how much real estate you need.

14:03.520 --> 14:12.520
It seems like it's a weird one, but it seems to be the thing that most people care about.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.520
You said the footfall, what's that?

14:14.520 --> 14:22.520
Footfall is basically the number of people coming in and out of the space, which parts of the space are busy versus under use.

14:22.520 --> 14:34.520
Okay, it's really interesting to hear you describe all of that. You know, when I think of the times that I've worked in a real office, quote unquote, you know, I just come in and kind of do my work.

14:34.520 --> 14:45.520
And you know, they were certainly times when, you know, I thought about the space like when it was too hot or too cold or when I had to walk really far to get to something.

14:45.520 --> 14:55.520
But to think about all of the various factors that I was not even thinking of that go into my comfort and productivity in the space.

14:55.520 --> 15:00.520
It's pretty astounding actually, you know, all the various variables that you just mentioned.

15:00.520 --> 15:09.520
So I can certainly understand why someone would want to take an analytics approach to optimizing these various factors.

15:09.520 --> 15:15.520
Yeah, and why do a lot of people have like legacy real estate as well?

15:15.520 --> 15:27.520
Because they just kind of grow without much of a plan, but they most people actually only realize they don't like a space when they when something goes wrong.

15:27.520 --> 15:37.520
Like the amount of work it takes to actually kind of efficiently allocate teams and so forth is is very interesting.

15:37.520 --> 15:55.520
One of the things that I have learned in the context of the industrial AI research that I've been doing is, you know, when I initially went into that, you know, I was thinking, you know, manufacturing and robots and, you know, those kinds of things.

15:55.520 --> 16:08.520
But this whole notion of managing and optimizing the physical plant is a huge opportunity for the application of machine learning in AI.

16:08.520 --> 16:17.520
And that's everything from, you know, data centers as well as, you know, the smart buildings stuff that we're talking about here.

16:17.520 --> 16:32.520
In addition to optimizing a building from the perspective of the comfort of its inhabitants, there are also pretty significant cost implications for managing all these systems for your customers.

16:32.520 --> 16:33.520
Is that right?

16:33.520 --> 16:46.520
Yes, for sure. And just like even in manufacturing and so forth, there are also a lot of assets that you have to, there's a lot of expensive assets, especially in high rises.

16:46.520 --> 16:54.520
I mean, simple things like a lot of the high rises have these window cleaning equipment built into them.

16:54.520 --> 17:06.520
So actually, like, again, it's kind of monitoring the use of this, monitoring like if it's windy, we shouldn't be using, you know, window cleaners remotely debugging it and so forth.

17:06.520 --> 17:22.520
I mean, it's like the least sexy bit of IoT, but it's the most impactful, in my opinion, because you're not necessarily, you're kind of, my colleague Sean said, you know, you're putting, like, it's like putting a set of, you know, a thousand or a million set of eyes.

17:22.520 --> 17:29.520
You could be monitoring it manually, but obviously that's, that's crazy. Why would you do that? That's what IoT is good for. It's good for counting.

17:29.520 --> 17:39.520
It's good for kind of fairly dumb measurements, but at aggregate and at scale, that obviously kind of, you know, it's, it's a very different way to run stuff.

17:39.520 --> 17:46.520
That most people are starting to just, I suppose, in the first card of getting their heads around what it means for various industries.

17:46.520 --> 18:01.520
Super interesting. So, what have you learned about applying machine learning and AI to IoT in general and smart buildings in particular?

18:01.520 --> 18:08.520
Maybe we can start by talking about what are some of the challenges in this use case area?

18:08.520 --> 18:22.520
Well, I mean, I think what I'm learning, so just, I'm going to start this by, I don't know, did you see the recent Cisco, recently Cisco published maybe about two or three weeks ago, that 75% of IoT projects fail?

18:22.520 --> 18:23.520
Did you see that?

18:23.520 --> 18:26.520
Oh, I vaguely remember seeing the Twitter headline, but that's about it.

18:26.520 --> 18:37.520
Right. So, the biggest challenge is actually, I mean, most of, I think data science generally is, is a kind of, you know, once you get data out, it's, you know,

18:37.520 --> 18:47.520
you can get some, some people to analyze it and so forth. I think the biggest challenge is actually deployment management and operational management of networks.

18:47.520 --> 19:05.520
What I mean by that is, once you have a significant amount of IoT devices in the wild, you, there is a significant network management problem that you're going to face, and most people don't know they need until they come across it.

19:05.520 --> 19:12.520
You have usually fairly cheap sensors with some batteries, monitoring your battery status, when does stuff need to be changed?

19:12.520 --> 19:17.520
When does the battery need to be changed? Where is all these assets? Like, where are they?

19:17.520 --> 19:25.520
So, tagging, making sure that you know, the kind of, making the deployment easy is another thing.

19:25.520 --> 19:40.520
So, there's a, I think before you even get like a shred of data, that's the biggest challenge is deployment and management, which has been a surprise to me, because I, I come from the data world, and I thought, well, you know, I get these streams.

19:40.520 --> 19:46.520
Obviously, I'm going to get the streams and I'm going to do some really cool things.

19:46.520 --> 19:55.520
So, yeah, it's been, it's been a very painful learning exercise, but it's one that I guess we're kind of grappling with.

19:55.520 --> 20:14.520
So, most of the data stuff that I do these days is actually, how do I get the, how do I get the kind of deployment times down and how do I, meaningfully and intelligently, alert people when their kind of various sensors are down or when they lose signal and so forth?

20:14.520 --> 20:28.520
So, the, this, the sensor challenges that you describe sound like, you know, very low level, low level things, you know, battery, network connectivity, things like that.

20:28.520 --> 20:36.520
But it sounds like this task of management may also involve some machine learning. Is that the case?

20:36.520 --> 20:49.520
So, the machine learning bit of kind of the network management or least kind of, it's more around the predictive maintenance of not just the assets that they monitor, but the sensors themselves.

20:49.520 --> 20:56.520
So, what you don't want to do is say, hey, you know, sensor A in this corner of the world has run out of battery.

20:56.520 --> 21:06.520
What you want to say is, like, the set of sensors in this corner of the world are likely to need updating, let's update them together.

21:06.520 --> 21:19.520
And because we know the patterns, let's, let's kind of change all the batteries while we're there, because the human cost of sending engineers and a truck in various places, changing one battery at a time is, it's crazy, right?

21:19.520 --> 21:27.520
And that's the kind of pattern pattern kind of finding that we're most concerned with at the moment.

21:27.520 --> 21:39.520
Okay. So, there's a prediction problem as well as kind of a fleet management slash traveling salesman type of optimization problem involved here.

21:39.520 --> 21:45.520
Exactly. Yeah. So, yeah, everyone talks about predictive maintenance of the stuff that they're monitoring.

21:45.520 --> 21:51.520
But actually, there's a predictive maintenance of the sensors, which is quite meta, I guess.

21:51.520 --> 22:14.520
And do you also do, you know, in the IT world, you might have, you know, some subset of systems that ultimately support some higher level service and one of the big applications of machine learning is to like correlate the, you know, various systems so that you can surface, you know, alerts and predictive.

22:14.520 --> 22:32.520
Insights about the systems themselves, do you do a similar thing in IOT where you are trying to understand what sensors are required to, you know, support a system or an application and give visibility to it.

22:32.520 --> 22:47.520
Yes. And this is, this is hard because we didn't actually set up to be a hardware company, but we are getting more and more into that world because most people come to us and say, oh, yeah, I want to do this thing.

22:47.520 --> 22:55.520
It's quite, it's usually quite vague. They're the thing. And then they say, you know, what sensor should I use? And we're like, Jesus, like, this is not what we set up to do.

22:55.520 --> 23:09.520
But it's just like a startup. But yeah, so, so, you know, we've now had to build about, I think we have about 30 relationships with various hardware vendors.

23:09.520 --> 23:20.520
And we've really had to get down to the very low level kind of both in terms of testing because if the sensor itself doesn't work, we obviously kind of the software side looks bad.

23:20.520 --> 23:36.520
So really we're kind of deeply tied into that world and, and, you know, visiting factories and how do you actually kind of test that stuff that's coming out of the factory lines is is correct.

23:36.520 --> 23:43.520
And then it's just kind of the cycle going down lower and lower into the into that world, which has been actually super interesting.

23:43.520 --> 23:52.520
You're visiting factories of the center. Yes. Manufacturer. Oh, wow. I thought you were talking about customer factories are initially really interesting.

23:52.520 --> 24:04.520
Yes. So there's a whole because a lot of these deployments, a lot of these sensor deployments involve on average, I think we're seeing about five different sensors being deployed on particular kind of sites.

24:04.520 --> 24:14.520
And they can range from the as a monitoring to football to environmental monitoring. And all of these sensors usually come from different places.

24:14.520 --> 24:25.520
And so we have to do this whole kind of weird logistic management and the gateways come from a different place of, yeah, weirdly we're kind of going more and more into that world.

24:25.520 --> 24:34.520
We now have like an embedded systems engineer on the team and he's basically dedicated to testing verifying a lot of the sensors.

24:34.520 --> 24:38.520
And obviously the data quality is really, really important.

24:38.520 --> 24:51.520
So somebody says, oh, I have a CO2 sensor. Can you confirm how you tested that because if you if the data quality is crap, no amount of analytics is going to help you. Right. Right.

24:51.520 --> 25:03.520
Interesting. Interesting. So can you talk a little bit about the algorithmic implications of all this.

25:03.520 --> 25:18.520
I'm still I have to say I'm still kind of grappling of what they've been. So so I think there's a lot of first principles that are still we're in such an early market that a lot of first principles are still to be to be figured out.

25:18.520 --> 25:26.520
So people talk a lot about all this IOT standards and all this kind of stuff. And that's actually that's not a problem.

25:26.520 --> 25:42.520
So matching kind of data sheets versus reality is a massive problem because you know, like I've done some crazy things like put humidity sensors in my as I'm running the shower to actually see to tech checking for data quality.

25:42.520 --> 25:49.520
Some of our customers have put like 10 air quality sensors next to each other to try to see what the output is. Right.

25:49.520 --> 25:58.520
Loading smoke on it. Just all sorts of crazy stuff because tests don't really exist for a lot of the stuff like standard tests.

25:58.520 --> 26:07.520
So what I like to say is more kind of testing kits because in calibration chambers because again for like we process.

26:07.520 --> 26:16.520
I think at the moment we process something like seven or eight million data points just from air quality a day right.

26:16.520 --> 26:23.520
But they're like they're all different manufacturers have their own kind of obviously kind of the analog sensors.

26:23.520 --> 26:34.520
So some are measuring like parts per billion versus parts of a million. So you can't really kind of correlate a manufacturer sensor that has that's measuring kind of parts per billion to million.

26:34.520 --> 26:39.520
You just can't do that. So how do we like having kind of the data.

26:39.520 --> 26:43.520
It's not a data quality problem, but some sort of data.

26:43.520 --> 26:49.520
I don't know how one is a word I'm looking for, but you know, some sort of like matching.

26:49.520 --> 26:57.520
I was just wondering if you were doing something like on the fly transformation or normalization of these different data values.

26:57.520 --> 27:06.520
Is that part of the solution you're offering we're not at the moment, but we're trying to figure out so we talk to a lot of environmental scientists and saying like how how would this.

27:06.520 --> 27:13.520
Well, how would you do a standard transformation between these different types of sensors from there isn't there isn't an answer yet.

27:13.520 --> 27:26.520
I'm afraid to say I mean elevation matters as well like if a sensor is at ground level near near the kind of exhaustive a car should we say versus at the top of the building.

27:26.520 --> 27:39.520
There are two different readings for the same spot right like so what we're trying to do is actually kind of include a lot of environmental scientists into these conversations who don't necessarily know anything about electronics.

27:39.520 --> 27:46.520
Yeah, a lot of these kind of standard ways of doing these transformations don't exist.

27:46.520 --> 28:12.520
That's been a consistent thing that I've been hearing in the conversations I've had with folks about trying to do things with AI in the industrial sphere and that is the importance of being able to incorporate subject matter expertise into the conversation into the way systems and algorithms are being developed.

28:12.520 --> 28:25.520
Sounds like you're seeing much of the same. Yes, yes, we are. I think there is a industry policy that if we get enough data, we can just figure it out because we'll just throw some algorithm at it.

28:25.520 --> 28:40.520
But there is fairly big nuances between the different types of yeah, the kind of how do we interpret this and how do we make this easy for other people to understand is a huge.

28:40.520 --> 28:48.520
It's a huge not issue, but it is something that is not going to take one domain or a bunch of computer scientists to figure out.

28:48.520 --> 29:00.520
I mean, we did a project about a year and a half ago where people deployed air quality sensors and then back gardens near Heathrow, which is a major airport in the UK.

29:00.520 --> 29:12.520
And, you know, there was nothing kind of surprising about that data COT level, sorry, noise levels are high, the kind of the particulates are really, really high.

29:12.520 --> 29:25.520
But people are asking us, you know, I have a kid, I live here, what is going to be the impact on my kids health? And I'm like, wow, I, this is way beyond my expertise.

29:25.520 --> 29:31.520
I can tell you what the trends are, you know, and that's not, that's not particularly helpful, right?

29:31.520 --> 29:54.520
So, I think generally IOT is going to need many, many domains. You have the electronics people that need to make, obviously kind of not just high quality sensors, but, you know, kind of make the variables the easy to understand or at least kind of kind of standardized the way these things are published.

29:54.520 --> 30:12.520
And then you have the domain experts that need to kind of make the data itself easy to understand is not necessarily algorithmic issues, but what does this mean? Like, does this actually for air quality, for example, like, how does low levels of particular exposure impact mile?

30:12.520 --> 30:18.520
And yes, it's super interesting, but very, very early.

30:18.520 --> 30:42.520
On the topic of the various algorithms and the approach to machine learning generally, are there specific other specific approaches or algorithms or ideas that apply best to IOT types of data?

30:42.520 --> 30:48.520
I don't think so. I mean, not that I've seen so far, I think.

30:48.520 --> 31:06.520
I guess that was maybe a, you know, to general a question. I guess what I'm trying to get a sense of is, you know, what's the, what are the standard approaches that you're taking for doing some of the things that we've talked about, like, you know, correlation.

31:06.520 --> 31:21.520
What degree does machine learning come into the play? Are you come into play? Are you, you know, doing, you know, fairly basic things? Are you doing things like neural networks? And then, you know, over time, where do you see things going?

31:21.520 --> 31:36.520
I say it's pretty basic. So the approach we're taking is we try to do phase approach, because when you think about IOT at scale is actually very expensive. You need lots of sensors to, to do kind of the more advanced stuff.

31:36.520 --> 31:48.520
So what we try to say is like, what is the thing that you need to know today with a minimal amount of data? And then how do we make it more and more sophisticated?

31:48.520 --> 32:00.520
I mean, versus kind of, you know, because there isn't most customers, especially nowadays when they get started, they don't have like tons of data. They're just, they're starting with a few sensors.

32:00.520 --> 32:09.520
The, actually the interesting, so there's two things that are kind of all, I'll hit on both, but remind me if I don't hit the second point.

32:09.520 --> 32:21.520
One is you, you start with, obviously you always start with the exploratory side list, let's deploy some sensors and let's just see what the kind of the general patterns are.

32:21.520 --> 32:35.520
And then let's kind of make it more and more sophisticated as you gather more data. And then let's, for space, especially for space design, it's a lot of the architects are saying, okay, once I have some, some data, I'm going to change the space.

32:35.520 --> 32:50.520
You see what impact that brings to, to the way people are using the space. And a lot of the times it's actually kind of, it looks like AB testing nowadays with physical space, which is super interesting.

32:50.520 --> 33:16.520
So, you know, you have what they say is pre-occupancies, what they call it is like, okay, let's just deploy some sensors before we've changed the space. And let's just understand, because previously architects would, especially would send a guy with like a clipboard to count or interview people, but what they said was actually a lot of the answers that they were getting were kind of either subjective or not incorrect, but you know, subjective.

33:16.520 --> 33:25.520
And so, initially it's just like, let's just give you some data so you can actually think about the use of this space and how you allocate teams in a different way.

33:25.520 --> 33:39.520
And then they, they redesign it and then they actually test against their, should we think kind of initial, initial kind of KPIs, like, you know, you know, and this is super new.

33:39.520 --> 33:54.520
So, this is like, you know, for architects, this is, this is never been done. So, yeah, I think it's kind of, to me, I like a lot of this stuff is more looking like what people are doing with, with AB testing of websites and so forth.

33:54.520 --> 33:59.520
So, I think the same kinds of ways of analyzing data apply.

33:59.520 --> 34:17.520
The second thing is around obviously kind of finding faults. And again, people talk about predictive maintenance quite a bit, but, you know, kind of in some of the arguments, especially is, is, can we order stuff for you before you need to order it yourself.

34:17.520 --> 34:33.520
So, order parts, I think there's one startup that I've seen that's, you know, you subscribe to their service and you get fertilizer, you know, kind of automatically based on kind of not just usage, but also kind of the soil conditions.

34:33.520 --> 34:44.520
And that changes for the times of the year and so forth. So, that's kind of we will enable you to automate a lot of these processes by kind of understanding the patterns that came before.

34:44.520 --> 34:53.520
It's a huge, again, I don't see it enough, but I think it's going to happen more and more, especially, especially at these kind of large industrial scales.

34:53.520 --> 35:08.520
Interesting. Have you, in terms of the analytics, you mentioned in some of the early, I think it was early days of open sensors, you were using things like storm.

35:08.520 --> 35:12.520
Can you talk a little bit about the technologies that you use?

35:12.520 --> 35:33.520
Yeah, I think so we have, we've actually re-architected pretty massive way, especially in the last six months. So, we, I mean, like in the early days, a lot of the kind of the real time systems were things like storm, we had to build our own kind of MQTT brokers and so forth.

35:33.520 --> 35:56.520
And now there's really sophisticated, you know, kind of middleware and so forth. So, we're kind of leveraging that. I guess we're, I hate the term again, but, you know, kind of going into this more kind of lightweights, serverless kind of architecture, where a lot of the kind of models are just lambdas based on, you know, they can learn.

35:56.520 --> 36:05.520
We deploy very lightweight functions or models without necessarily kind of managing this really, really complex model. So that makes sense.

36:05.520 --> 36:13.520
It does. So, the models themselves, what, what stack do you use for model development?

36:13.520 --> 36:29.520
So, various, so I come from obviously the closure world, so I still write a lot of, a lot of kind of closure. Now the rest of the team are actually kind of kind of moving away from that.

36:29.520 --> 36:47.520
So, I'm trying, it's fine, but I'm still the only one that's kind of more of the functional person. So, there is, there's a lot of work being done and especially in Python and the kind of scientific libraries in Python.

36:47.520 --> 36:53.520
I've gone through my five stages of grief about that already.

36:53.520 --> 37:02.520
You guys can't handle closure. Fine. Use this inferior programming language or paradigm for that matter.

37:02.520 --> 37:15.520
It's not here, but I think I've had to, my role has definitely evolved to being the pointy-haired boss that's more like I had to give up the cool stuff that I would do.

37:15.520 --> 37:35.520
But it's, I think the point I'm making is more that in terms of a lot of the work we did actually, especially for the early kind of alerting predictive maintenance and so forth, you don't need, I mean, you don't need really, really complicated algorithms.

37:35.520 --> 37:47.520
And, and for mostly by think what I see with IoT especially is like the kind of upfront over-engineering of we'll do this really, really, really interesting stuff before they've got any data.

37:47.520 --> 38:02.520
That's the kind of culture that we're trying to break is like let's solve the really easy problems first and one day we'll start using some crazy deep learning for, for something.

38:02.520 --> 38:23.520
That's what people do. Right. Right. Interesting. So the, I guess I have a question about the specifics of doing any kind of machine learning in an environment that's primarily focused on time series data.

38:23.520 --> 38:39.520
Are you applying machine learning on streaming data kind of as it's, you know, in-flight streaming data or are you primarily doing it after it's been landed in some data source or some, you know, some data structure.

38:39.520 --> 38:43.520
Yeah, I guess that's the place to start the question.

38:43.520 --> 39:04.520
Yeah, so I mean, you build, so you build your models on whatever historical data you have. So let's, let's kind of take specifically around, I don't know, like let's take a simple thing like, is a sensor going to break and that pattern is obviously kind of the models built on, you know, six months or a year's worth of data.

39:04.520 --> 39:18.520
And then yes, because the alerts that you need for, especially the predictive maintenance side, the data sets are running through the models on real time and you're trying to kind of get alerts in real time.

39:18.520 --> 39:45.520
There is a third, there's a kind of an interesting development that I'm seeing and, and how many, not that something we're doing, but some, some kind of other companies are, which is actually came like based on, based on space, based on certain characteristics and even might be some physical data that we have that somebody's counted or parking meters, for example, how many sensors do we actually need.

39:45.520 --> 40:01.520
And that's very, I think that's very interesting to me. There's a company that we worked with about two years ago that took a lot of like historical parking data and from that, try to create a model around how many sensors to deploy.

40:01.520 --> 40:13.520
And I think efficient kind of deployment is especially at scale is, is kind of another aspect. I'm not describing this properly.

40:13.520 --> 40:24.520
So what I'm hearing is using models to actually this is something that came up in this industrial AI research that I mentioned.

40:24.520 --> 40:34.520
There are actually a number of use cases where folks are using models to optimize resource placement.

40:34.520 --> 40:45.520
So, you know, this can be everything from at the macro level, you know, things like where do we put, you know, fire hydrants and fire stations in a city?

40:45.520 --> 40:53.520
And where do we put the roads to a semiconductor? How do we route the, you know, the various paths in the semiconductor?

40:53.520 --> 41:05.520
And it sounds like in your world, these same techniques are being used to determine, you know, where and what the optimal placement is for sensors.

41:05.520 --> 41:24.520
Yes, exactly. And how many, do we need 100% coverage, like do you need 100% coverage of parking sensors, for example, or can you get away with just enough data if you covered 60% of the base with parking sensors?

41:24.520 --> 41:38.520
Because, again, once you're able to be more efficient, I mean, it's the cost of not just the kind of the hardware, but it's also the maintenance cost that people are really trying to optimize.

41:38.520 --> 41:55.520
So, the idea being that if you, if you have less than full coverage of the parking sensors, then you can do like some kind of statistical model. And I'm assuming the parking sensors are used to drive the signs to tell you how many slots are left.

41:55.520 --> 42:03.520
If you have 60% coverage, you can try to use some statistical model, as opposed to showing an exact number. Is that the main use case or are there others?

42:03.520 --> 42:14.520
If you know, if you know the patterns of how people park generally, you can make some kind of best guess rooting software over kind of enough data.

42:14.520 --> 42:22.520
So, so the kind of the question that especially as IOT mature is that we'll come up over and over again is how much data is is enough.

42:22.520 --> 42:36.520
Because the tradeoff between kind of full deployment and like not enough data and not enough sensors is still a thing to be figured out.

42:36.520 --> 42:56.520
One of the things that I've heard come up quite a bit in the context of IOT is folks starting to look at doing inference at the edge. So, you know, building your model centrally and then deploying them out on some edge device and doing inference closer to where decisions need to be made.

42:56.520 --> 42:59.520
Is that something that comes up in your use case?

42:59.520 --> 43:16.520
Yeah, for sure. So, most of the sensors that we deploy tend to be neural networks. So, they use, so the kind of the stack is a sensor talks to a gateway or multiple gateways and the gateway talks to something and internet.

43:16.520 --> 43:32.520
Now, a lot of the times the gateways are, you know, fairly robust. They can run kind of a minimal computation and a lot of the deployments that we do, you have one gateway covering probably a whole building.

43:32.520 --> 43:53.520
So, pushing more and more, especially as a lot of this, the kind of the work we do becomes starts to touch kind of critical infrastructure such as lighting, for example, what you don't want is a situation where, you know, your AWS kind of infrastructure has gone down and you can't turn on the lights or change the lights.

43:53.520 --> 44:14.520
So, I think the edge, the edge is going to be more and more important, but again, there's, for my observation, at least, there doesn't seem to be a clear, a clear separation of concerns, like what lives where is still a thing to be figured out by the industry.

44:14.520 --> 44:25.520
So, it sounds like for this particular use case, the pushing the machine learning to the edge, you're not quite there yet, but it's something where you can, you can see it coming down the line.

44:25.520 --> 44:38.520
I can see it coming down the line, but yeah, not yet, because the gateways is still, I mean, it's still early days of a lot of these gateways, but it's only, it's only a matter of time before there.

44:38.520 --> 44:54.520
The memory is going to be kind of much better and the kind of DevOps of the gateways is going to be against standard, because you need to be able to easily update them and remotely kind of orchestrate them.

44:54.520 --> 45:06.520
And what I'm excited about is things like AWS Greengrass, for example, I think they bring this potential over the next few years, and I'm kind of playing around with it, but I haven't deployed in production yet.

45:06.520 --> 45:10.520
And what's Greengrass for those that don't know, and why are you excited about it?

45:10.520 --> 45:14.520
Oh, goodness, so I'm going to start AWS services now.

45:14.520 --> 45:23.520
So, the Greengrass is advertising local compute, so lambda style compute at big gateway level.

45:23.520 --> 45:33.520
Or, I mean, it says for devices, but, you know, kind of, you know, I wouldn't necessarily run it in a very small cheap dumb device, but if you have a gateway,

45:33.520 --> 45:39.520
you can run lambda functions, and you can obviously do everything that most things that lambda functions can do.

45:39.520 --> 45:49.520
So it's starting to push more and more compute down to the edge level, but it's not something that I've seen anyone at least run in production.

45:49.520 --> 45:56.520
I think there's a lot of, there's a lot of excitement. There's a lot of kind of interest in it, but ask me this time next year.

45:56.520 --> 46:09.520
Okay, okay. So the sensors that you've talked about thus far are, you know, I'd say simple sensors, although you've described in detail, their complexity and the challenges they create.

46:09.520 --> 46:15.520
Are you doing anything with computer vision with photographic sensors?

46:15.520 --> 46:33.520
Yeah, there's a couple of companies that we work with, there are partners of ours. One company is called ModCAM, so they have, so a lot of people are using them for for counting within retail contracts and within even kind of even the buildings context.

46:33.520 --> 46:45.520
So I don't know much about the tech they use, but they're, they're vision sensors that are, but they're doing all the processing on the device level, which I think is super interesting.

46:45.520 --> 46:52.520
So they're not sending back kind of video, but they're, they give you accounts, they give you some heat maps and so forth.

46:52.520 --> 46:53.520
Oh, wow.

46:53.520 --> 47:03.520
Yeah, I think it's, it's, it's one of the most kind of probably more exciting hardware companies that I've come across over the last few years.

47:03.520 --> 47:20.520
So you're able to, you know, what, where your system may not be designed for ingesting video data, you're able to integrate, you know, this video sensor in because it's providing aggregate metrics to you that you can just suck right in.

47:20.520 --> 47:31.520
So they have like a grid system, so they send you an array of data back, and that could be the counts in real time of people kind of as they move through these groups.

47:31.520 --> 47:37.520
And that's, that's good enough for you to understand how many people are kind of the flows of people and so forth.

47:37.520 --> 47:49.520
So I think, yeah, I mean, I think those kind of developments are really quite cool because, you know, as an industry, we don't, we haven't been constrained for a long time on the chip.

47:49.520 --> 47:57.520
And how much processing we can do. So this is skill that not many people have, but I think it's developing.

47:57.520 --> 48:08.520
Did you, when we spoke earlier, you mentioned that in your experience, generic machine learning doesn't really work in this use case.

48:08.520 --> 48:17.520
Have you fully articulated kind of the thoughts behind that, or was there more that that you wanted to say there?

48:17.520 --> 48:21.520
I guess, well, I mean, it wouldn't be fair to say generic machine learning wouldn't work.

48:21.520 --> 48:24.520
Maybe I've been too harsh.

48:24.520 --> 48:27.520
I'm rolling back now. I'm just going to, you can see me.

48:27.520 --> 48:41.520
But it, well, you know, maybe we can start by saying when you, when you think that, or when you say that, what do you mean by generic machine learning and what do you mean by, you know, doesn't work or isn't ideal?

48:41.520 --> 48:54.520
I guess, I guess what I mean is I'm pushing back probably being hugely contrary and against IOT is a data and data out problem kind of it really kind of.

48:54.520 --> 49:01.520
Yeah, it's, it's an annoying vision that people have that they could just, they could just do something on streaming data.

49:01.520 --> 49:11.520
And then I see advertisements for generic kind of IOT. Oh, we do IOT analytics and I think what does that even mean?

49:11.520 --> 49:22.520
There is no such thing like so what I'd like to say, I think the industry is going to form around verticals or use cases and all of the machine learning knowledge we have can get applied.

49:22.520 --> 49:29.520
And I think that's the most interesting. I mean, IOT is like saying we're like, it's like saying the web. It means nothing.

49:29.520 --> 49:43.520
So, just like we have, you know, CRM systems, e-commerce systems and so forth, I think IOT will get those kind of blends of systems of that are kind of applicable to do one or two things really, really well.

49:43.520 --> 49:49.520
And the intelligence layer will apply to the, to the thing that is, you know, kind of trying to do.

49:49.520 --> 50:09.520
So, and that's, that's what I'd like to see more of is is, you know, kind of let's say, whether it's machine learning or not, the kind of what we need for a wearable type, you know, device is very different to industrial IOT, to buildings, to, you know, everything else to consume our goods and all that kind of stuff.

50:09.520 --> 50:26.520
So, you know, I think they're still a long way to go and define in this and what are the variables that are necessary to that kind of put the end outcomes first and then designs the algorithms, if that makes sense.

50:26.520 --> 50:44.520
That makes a ton of sense. What I hear you saying really resonate strongly with with something that I tell people and that is start with the business problem first start with the problem that you're trying to solve and if you don't know that figure that out, but once you do start there.

50:44.520 --> 50:57.520
And also earlier, you made another point that I tend to tell people and that is, you know, do the simplest thing that solves your business problem and, you know, don't get too caught up in trying to be too fancy.

50:57.520 --> 51:22.520
Yes, yeah. And it's the temptation, if you're very technical, especially today is to go for it be kind of, I'm going to build the coolest thing in the world and so forth. And that is, yeah, that is, especially in IOT, he doesn't work because you, you don't have, it's not just like software or you have this luxury of being able to do kind of quick iterations once you've deployed something, you're kind of stuck with it.

51:22.520 --> 51:31.520
So being very conservative where you start is trust me is going to save you a lot of heartache and money.

51:31.520 --> 51:47.520
Any other advice you'd give to someone who is trying to get smarter about their physical facilities, whether, you know, be smart buildings or data centers or, you know, any of the other things that you work with.

51:47.520 --> 51:57.520
Gosh, that is, I think, well, I'm not going to advertise my services, but I'm going to say that.

51:57.520 --> 52:03.520
But I think it's, I'm going to give the same advice that I give most people that I've got to start a variety.

52:03.520 --> 52:25.520
Get something like five centers in a lab environment working before, before you kind of scale up, get it working, get it kind of, get it solving something, even if it's just, it's just kind of go outside of the building and outside of the kind of theoretical world as it were.

52:25.520 --> 52:43.520
Because I see a lot of ambition in the industry, I see a lot of, we want to run before we can kind of give them crawl stage, I think, where people are possibly kind of specking out quite cool stuff because they want to be part of this future or whatever.

52:43.520 --> 52:58.520
But the reality is that when you started that place, you kind of forget about the first principles, you forget about the first principles of security and security doesn't have to be anything basic security and so forth.

52:58.520 --> 53:14.520
So I would say just to start small usually on everything on both the IoT side and on the data side, it's the least glamorous kind of advice, but it's really true for this case.

53:14.520 --> 53:21.520
What I'm hearing there is keeping it real.

53:21.520 --> 53:28.520
And there's definitely, well, you're at, you're at the nexus of two over hype spaces.

53:28.520 --> 53:35.520
So it probably serves you very well to try to keep it real to, you know, as much as possible.

53:35.520 --> 53:46.520
Yeah, I think a lot of people are disappointed because I don't kind of, I'm like the most cynical person probably in the industry now all these years.

53:46.520 --> 54:05.520
That's awesome. Well, I have really enjoyed this conversation and learned a lot about the intersection between between IoT and machine learning and how that's all applied to smart sensors and smart buildings, anything else you'd like to leave our audience with.

54:05.520 --> 54:13.520
I think I've talked it up, but I really appreciate them. If they've listened this far, I really appreciate it. Thank you very much.

54:13.520 --> 54:18.520
Well, if they've listened this far and still have questions, how can they find you?

54:18.520 --> 54:27.520
You can find me. I'm at your stand on Twitter or at open sensors, we are at open sensors IO so far away.

54:27.520 --> 54:33.520
I would like to see more people engaged in this industry and they're kind of getting their hands dirty away versus the kind of the marketing way.

54:33.520 --> 54:40.520
So always, always happy to help on questions and getting people started and resources and so forth.

54:40.520 --> 54:46.520
Awesome. Awesome. Well, thanks so much, you did. I really appreciate it. And thank you.

54:46.520 --> 54:49.520
