00:00.000 --> 00:15.920
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

00:15.920 --> 00:20.880
people doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.440
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:23.440 --> 00:28.400
Once again, let's start the show by sending some love out to you, the listeners for your

00:28.400 --> 00:32.560
continued support over the last few weeks and months.

00:32.560 --> 00:38.560
This community continues to amaze us, continues to grow and to engage with us, which we love

00:38.560 --> 00:40.060
to see.

00:40.060 --> 00:44.440
We've said it before, but please don't hesitate to reach out to us with any questions,

00:44.440 --> 00:50.440
comments, guest or topic requests or just a friendly hello via any of our various channels.

00:50.440 --> 00:54.480
You can reach us on our Facebook page or Twitter at Twimble AI.

00:54.480 --> 01:02.320
You can reach me directly at Sam Charrington on Twitter or you can email us at teamattwimoleia.com.

01:02.320 --> 01:08.040
Speaking of community, please take note, the next Twimble online meetup is coming up soon.

01:08.040 --> 01:14.920
On Tuesday, November 14th, at 3pm Pacific time, we'll be joined by Kevin T, who will be

01:14.920 --> 01:21.040
presenting his paper, active preference learning for personalized portfolio construction.

01:21.040 --> 01:25.040
If you've already registered for the meetup, you should have received an invitation with

01:25.040 --> 01:26.680
all the details.

01:26.680 --> 01:32.640
If you still need to sign up, just head on over to Twimoleia.com slash meetup to do so.

01:32.640 --> 01:34.240
We hope to see you there.

01:34.240 --> 01:39.400
Now as you may know, a few weeks ago we spent some time in New York City hosted by our

01:39.400 --> 01:42.520
friends at NYU Future Labs.

01:42.520 --> 01:47.120
About six months ago, we covered their inaugural AI Summit, an event they hosted to showcase

01:47.120 --> 01:52.320
the startups in their first batch of their AI Nexus Lab Accelerator program, as well

01:52.320 --> 01:55.920
as the impressive AI talent in the New York City ecosystem.

01:55.920 --> 02:00.640
Well, this time we had the pleasure of interviewing the four startups from the second AI Nexus

02:00.640 --> 02:07.160
Lab batch, Mount Clevverist, Bite AI, Second Mind, and Bowtie Labs.

02:07.160 --> 02:11.120
We also interviewed some of the great speakers from the event, and we're presenting a couple

02:11.120 --> 02:14.120
of those interviews to you this week.

02:14.120 --> 02:20.440
If you missed any of the shows in the series, visit Twimoleia.com slash AI Nexus Lab 2 to

02:20.440 --> 02:22.000
get caught up.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.160
In this episode, I speak with Ross Fadley, a New York-based AI Lee with Insight Data Science.

02:29.160 --> 02:34.840
Insight is a really interesting company offering a free seven week postdoctoral training fellowship,

02:34.840 --> 02:40.200
helping individuals to bridge the gap between academia and careers in data science, data

02:40.200 --> 02:42.840
engineering, and AI.

02:42.840 --> 02:47.040
Ross joined me backstage at the Future Lab Summit after leading a machine learning primer

02:47.040 --> 02:48.840
for attendees.

02:48.840 --> 02:52.800
Our conversation explores some of the knowledge gaps that Insight has identified in folks

02:52.800 --> 02:57.520
coming out of academia, and how they structured their program to address them.

02:57.520 --> 03:01.480
If you find yourself looking to make this transition, you'll definitely want to check

03:01.480 --> 03:03.120
out this episode.

03:03.120 --> 03:13.040
And now onto the show.

03:13.040 --> 03:19.520
Alright everyone, I am backstage at the NYU Skurball Center, where the Future Lab Group

03:19.520 --> 03:25.760
is holding the AI Summit, and I am here with Ross Fadley, who is the AI lead at Insight

03:25.760 --> 03:26.760
Data.

03:26.760 --> 03:28.800
Ross, welcome to this weekend machine learning and AI.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.560
Hi, pleasure to be here.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.600
It's great to have you on the show.

03:32.600 --> 03:35.840
Why don't we get started by having you tell me a little bit about your background and

03:35.840 --> 03:38.480
how you got interested and involved in AI?

03:38.480 --> 03:39.480
Sure.

03:39.480 --> 03:42.040
So I have a background in physics, actually.

03:42.040 --> 03:46.200
So when I was in undergrad, I was really passionate about physics, and ended up going and

03:46.200 --> 03:49.680
do a PhD focusing on astrophysics.

03:49.680 --> 03:50.680
Okay.

03:50.680 --> 03:54.800
And that time really drove me to understand and appreciate data.

03:54.800 --> 04:00.600
So during that I was really focused on doing Bayesian machine learning because we had relatively

04:00.600 --> 04:04.640
small amounts of data, but we needed to quantify the uncertainty of our models.

04:04.640 --> 04:10.520
And so that I kind of just got forced into because of how I went down my academic path,

04:10.520 --> 04:14.760
but it made me really excited by what was happening in machine learning and some of the

04:14.760 --> 04:17.360
new emerging technologies on that front.

04:17.360 --> 04:18.360
Awesome.

04:18.360 --> 04:23.200
I have talked to a ton of folks who came into machine learning and AI by way of physics.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.200
Yeah.

04:24.200 --> 04:29.080
And one of the interesting things that happened when I was a postdoc, most recently at NYU,

04:29.080 --> 04:32.560
I was jointly appointed with the computer science group with Rob Fergis, who won the

04:32.560 --> 04:36.040
image net competition while I was there working with him.

04:36.040 --> 04:40.120
And so it was like a really neat opportunity to apply some of these emerging AI like deep

04:40.120 --> 04:44.320
learning models in the context of astronomy, which was really exciting times.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.320
Oh nice.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.440
And how did he win that before after Matt Zeeler?

04:47.440 --> 04:48.920
Oh, he won it with him.

04:48.920 --> 04:49.920
A with?

04:49.920 --> 04:50.920
Yeah.

04:50.920 --> 04:51.920
Okay.

04:51.920 --> 04:52.920
Okay.

04:52.920 --> 04:54.920
So this is our second year here at the Future Lab Summit.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.600
And last year, I keep saying year.

04:57.600 --> 05:02.080
And Steve keeps saying year on stage, it was actually only six months ago.

05:02.080 --> 05:06.720
But so the second time here, and last time I got to interview Matt and hear a little bit

05:06.720 --> 05:07.920
about his story.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.720
So you are in the same group.

05:09.720 --> 05:10.720
Yeah.

05:10.720 --> 05:13.760
So Matt was a PhD student with Rob while I was Rob's postdoc.

05:13.760 --> 05:14.760
Okay.

05:14.760 --> 05:17.280
It was interesting because I was jointly appointed with the physics group.

05:17.280 --> 05:21.600
And so we were doing a little bit of crosstalk in terms of like bringing some computer science

05:21.600 --> 05:27.040
applications to astronomy, but also leveraging some astrophysical knowledge when we're applying

05:27.040 --> 05:28.040
some of these techniques.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.040
Okay.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.040
Awesome.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.040
And now insight data.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.040
What does insight data do?

05:32.040 --> 05:34.520
So insight is a professional education company.

05:34.520 --> 05:35.520
Okay.

05:35.520 --> 05:40.240
We run free seven week fellowship programs to help people transition into careers in data.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.240
Oh wow.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.240
Yeah.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.240
Specifically, it's focused around.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.240
Did you just say free?

05:44.240 --> 05:45.240
Yeah.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.240
That's amazing.

05:46.240 --> 05:47.240
So free to the fellows.

05:47.240 --> 05:51.840
Historically, it came out of the fact that like, there were really smart people in academia.

05:51.840 --> 05:55.600
And companies needed like data scientists, but didn't know how to find them.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.600
Yeah.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.880
But like these smart people were there and they didn't know how to connect.

05:59.880 --> 06:05.600
So our founder, Jake Clampka, realized that there is this mismatch and formed the company.

06:05.600 --> 06:11.200
But of course, academics aren't, you know, able to pay a fee for education because they're

06:11.200 --> 06:13.880
usually pretty, you know, strapped for cash.

06:13.880 --> 06:18.040
So we find it really important to like make these free for the fellows and the company's

06:18.040 --> 06:19.680
sponsor of the program basically.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.680
Okay.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.440
And what is the typical fellow profile?

06:22.440 --> 06:28.320
It depends on the program. So in data science, it's typically a PhD in a quantitative field.

06:28.320 --> 06:33.160
So it does span traditional backgrounds like physics, math, computer science.

06:33.160 --> 06:37.920
But it also spans into, you know, biological sciences, even things like political science

06:37.920 --> 06:41.200
and linguistics, kind of a mix.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.320
So that's our data science program.

06:43.320 --> 06:47.800
But we also run a data engineering program, a health data program.

06:47.800 --> 06:51.200
And I'm in charge of the AI program that we run here in New York.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.200
Okay.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.480
AI program and the data science program are distinct.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.480
Yeah.

06:55.480 --> 06:56.480
That's correct.

06:56.480 --> 07:00.000
So the AI program is a little bit different in terms of backgrounds because we see this

07:00.000 --> 07:04.960
mismatch of what people want in the industry and where people are coming from.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.920
So often people in industry are looking for two broad buckets.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.920
One is like the AI engineer.

07:10.920 --> 07:15.560
So someone who has extreme engineering talent, maybe knows the machine learning parts quite

07:15.560 --> 07:19.400
well, but maybe not to the same degree that someone who's been doing research for a long

07:19.400 --> 07:20.400
time.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.400
Right.

07:21.400 --> 07:28.880
And so the AI is the idea that the AI program accommodates both this machine learning engineer

07:28.880 --> 07:35.360
and someone who's more traditionally like a data scientist, but focused on AI or that

07:35.360 --> 07:41.560
the data scientist goes through the data science program and the AI program kind of fills

07:41.560 --> 07:45.120
the rest of the need for this around this engineering role.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.120
Yeah.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.120
No, it's more of the former.

07:47.120 --> 07:48.120
So we do see.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.120
I thought for sure I was wrong as I was.

07:49.120 --> 07:54.400
Well, you nailed it quite right, actually, because like some of these deep learning models

07:54.400 --> 08:00.120
are quite specific, quite new and really cutting edge, the AI program tries to bring in people

08:00.120 --> 08:05.880
from that group of research into the program, which is not necessarily true for data science

08:05.880 --> 08:06.880
more generally.

08:06.880 --> 08:07.880
Okay.

08:07.880 --> 08:08.880
Got it.

08:08.880 --> 08:15.560
And so the program is kind of like this, you know, farm team feeder program kind of things

08:15.560 --> 08:20.280
specifically for academics that's not like your typical coding boot camp or something

08:20.280 --> 08:23.800
like that, where you're taking people off the street and training them up.

08:23.800 --> 08:30.240
So we actually do admit people from industry, but only for our currently at least for our

08:30.240 --> 08:35.280
data engineering and AI programs, again, on this engineering front for AI, for instance,

08:35.280 --> 08:37.960
some of the best engineers are people in industry.

08:37.960 --> 08:43.440
We've had people from teams like Google, LinkedIn, Salesforce, top engineers who want to move

08:43.440 --> 08:46.000
more into AI come through our programs.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.000
Okay.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
Oh, wow.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.600
And so you talked a little bit about it.

08:51.600 --> 08:57.120
Some of the missing, the things that the industry is looking for that are missing at like

08:57.120 --> 08:58.120
a really high level.

08:58.120 --> 09:02.160
Can you go a little bit more deep on that like what?

09:02.160 --> 09:05.640
What are the things that you're really trying to teach these folks as they come through

09:05.640 --> 09:06.640
the program?

09:06.640 --> 09:13.040
Well, often the people who are coming into our program have like 95 to 99% of the technical

09:13.040 --> 09:14.040
skills you need.

09:14.040 --> 09:18.600
So they often come in with an experience say deep in computer vision and are well suited

09:18.600 --> 09:23.240
for those types of roles, but they don't know like the trade-offs and how people are actually

09:23.240 --> 09:26.200
using this in practice on real teams.

09:26.200 --> 09:31.680
And so one of the things we do is to help give them this idea of not only like scoping

09:31.680 --> 09:36.480
and appropriately like doing a project that speaks to the type of work that they're going

09:36.480 --> 09:41.600
to be doing in industry, but we bring in top mentors from teams who tell them about the

09:41.600 --> 09:46.200
work they're doing, help them understand what's like the most important thing and what

09:46.200 --> 09:48.640
are the critical challenges they're currently facing.

09:48.640 --> 09:52.480
And that sort of information is something that you it's really hard to get isolated on

09:52.480 --> 09:54.760
your own in a black box.

09:54.760 --> 10:02.120
And is it like project oriented or is it more traditional just you know model by model

10:02.120 --> 10:03.440
or field by field?

10:03.440 --> 10:08.920
Yeah, we find it's really important to not have like coursework or book work.

10:08.920 --> 10:15.080
It's all project oriented so the fellows execute a significant like data science, data engineering,

10:15.080 --> 10:19.680
AI projects during their time at insight and it's done in a collaborative way.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.800
So it's a very collaborative environment.

10:21.800 --> 10:26.640
It's full time so everyone's together in a room, super smart people and they leverage

10:26.640 --> 10:30.840
off each other's knowledge because one person might be a deep expert in NLP.

10:30.840 --> 10:35.040
The other one may know nothing about it when they start talking they learn much more

10:35.040 --> 10:38.480
rapidly than if you they were told to like go off in a corner and read a book.

10:38.480 --> 10:41.640
And how many people in a given cohort?

10:41.640 --> 10:45.720
So there's roughly about 30 people in each cohort.

10:45.720 --> 10:49.520
We're currently in four cities and we run those three times a year.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.920
So that's gives you a little bit of a scale there.

10:51.920 --> 10:52.920
What cities?

10:52.920 --> 11:00.040
So we started out in Palo Alto in 2012, are in New York, Boston and Seattle and we also run

11:00.040 --> 11:01.040
a remote program.

11:01.040 --> 11:03.520
I could have guessed those right.

11:03.520 --> 11:10.120
And are you expanding more cities or are you adding more programs like what's the expansion

11:10.120 --> 11:11.120
plan if any?

11:11.120 --> 11:12.640
Yeah, that's a great question.

11:12.640 --> 11:16.560
So to give you a little understanding of our previous expansion, we kicked off New

11:16.560 --> 11:20.880
York in 2014, along with a new program in data engineering.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.040
So we started just data science.

11:23.040 --> 11:26.160
We then launched Boston focused on health data.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.600
That was also in 2014 I believe.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.440
And then most recently Seattle and data science.

11:31.440 --> 11:36.800
This last year was our first launch of the AI program, which started off in Palo Alto,

11:36.800 --> 11:39.360
ran for the first time in New York over the summer.

11:39.360 --> 11:41.760
So that's like our historical growth.

11:41.760 --> 11:46.120
We're planning to move into new cities in the coming future, possibly in international

11:46.120 --> 11:52.160
locations and thinking heavily about new programs as they come up in industry.

11:52.160 --> 11:57.040
The goal really is like to live on this edge of the mismatch between what companies need

11:57.040 --> 12:02.240
and are struggling to find good people in and where there's a gap in terms of talent

12:02.240 --> 12:05.360
and how can we bridge that gap?

12:05.360 --> 12:10.240
It strikes me that it's, it strikes me that you have to address some of these challenges

12:10.240 --> 12:13.640
and this kind of impedance mismatch via projects.

12:13.640 --> 12:19.360
But also it's challenging to do so because you don't know what you don't know kind of

12:19.360 --> 12:20.360
problem, right?

12:20.360 --> 12:26.320
And so how do you supplement the project work with, you know, the things that they need

12:26.320 --> 12:29.400
to know or is it just, you know, go bang your head against the wall and figure it out

12:29.400 --> 12:33.360
and when you finally figure out what you don't know, we'll be here to answer the question

12:33.360 --> 12:34.360
for you.

12:34.360 --> 12:35.360
Yeah.

12:35.360 --> 12:40.720
So as program directors, as the people who run these programs, their job is to ensure

12:40.720 --> 12:45.880
that they have the resources to overcome technical hurdles as they approach them.

12:45.880 --> 12:50.320
We encourage them to first dive into it and hit the walls themselves, but then just

12:50.320 --> 12:54.360
basically give them the right tools and guidance to overcome those technical hurdles.

12:54.360 --> 12:59.320
Some of that might become, come from us, like as people who run the programs, but we have

12:59.320 --> 13:03.600
over 1200 people who have gone through our programs currently and they come back and

13:03.600 --> 13:08.160
regularly mentor the people in the program, not only on the technical front, but also

13:08.160 --> 13:13.160
like what is it like to be a data scientist at X company and so on?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.320
Very cool.

13:14.320 --> 13:20.800
And so is the program run as a single project, kind of like a capstone thing or is it a

13:20.800 --> 13:23.000
series of smaller projects?

13:23.000 --> 13:29.000
Yeah, it is just a single project because we want it to have a significant amount of

13:29.000 --> 13:33.720
depth that it's like, impressive to see what someone can actually accomplish in just three

13:33.720 --> 13:35.320
or four weeks' time.

13:35.320 --> 13:38.960
Later on, the program, the fellows are going around and presenting this work as a way

13:38.960 --> 13:43.600
to warm start the interview process with companies that are interested in meaning, sure.

13:43.600 --> 13:49.000
And are the projects things that they work on individually or in as part of teams, understanding

13:49.000 --> 13:53.440
that there's collaboration and people helping each other, but do I, you know, are folks

13:53.440 --> 13:56.480
grouped into smaller teams to work on things?

13:56.480 --> 14:00.320
Yeah, it's really individual based because ultimately these people are hoping to launch

14:00.320 --> 14:04.800
their new career and when they're going to meet a new hiring manager and having some

14:04.800 --> 14:08.480
of their first interviews, being able to talk about something they concretely did and

14:08.480 --> 14:12.400
not having mixed signals of who did what, it's really important.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.400
Okay.

14:13.400 --> 14:17.080
I guess I was wondering if, you know, if you had any startups come out of this, like if

14:17.080 --> 14:22.520
someone, you know, if teams, I guess, or maybe if individuals, like, puts, built something

14:22.520 --> 14:26.680
as part of this program and decided, well, you know, forget industry, I'm going to, well,

14:26.680 --> 14:30.840
forget a job, I'm going to start a company around this thing that I did.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.720
Yeah, there's been a few examples of that.

14:33.720 --> 14:39.200
We're seeing more of it sort of come about, especially with the AI program in particular,

14:39.200 --> 14:43.920
because there's a new sort of green space that's being created around AI startups.

14:43.920 --> 14:48.640
And so we're working closely with fellows who are interested in launching these new

14:48.640 --> 14:53.160
initiatives, as well as ones who want something like a more traditional path.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.160
Okay.

14:54.160 --> 15:01.320
And so if you could give a list of folks who, or if you could give folks who, you know,

15:01.320 --> 15:06.560
are similarly situated in academia or have, you know, strong backgrounds in the theory

15:06.560 --> 15:12.840
of machine learning and AI, but not the practical experience, if you can give those folks a list

15:12.840 --> 15:20.000
of, you know, you tell me how long, one, three, five, ten things to go, you know, figure

15:20.000 --> 15:26.720
out or learn about in lieu of an experience like insight, like what's on that list?

15:26.720 --> 15:32.640
Often for people, especially in pure academics, a little bit about tooling, so some of them

15:32.640 --> 15:38.400
might be using a language like MATLAB or R or other languages that maybe aren't sort

15:38.400 --> 15:43.440
of industry standard, making sure that you have the tooling to do that.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.040
Secondly is sort of like the techniques.

15:46.040 --> 15:50.360
Often when you're doing a PhD, you get a book learning of, you know, the broad landscape

15:50.360 --> 15:55.800
of, you know, machine learning, deep learning, and then you dive deeply on one specific model.

15:55.800 --> 16:00.640
But often when you're on these teams, you want to be able to speak to more broad topics.

16:00.640 --> 16:06.280
So not just knowing one type of NLP, but knowing the broad spectrum in a more deep way.

16:06.280 --> 16:10.440
And so the way you might be able to do that is to actually take on concrete projects

16:10.440 --> 16:16.960
with not just clean data sets that come from like Kaggle or some machine learning depository,

16:16.960 --> 16:21.920
but actually real live data that either you scraped or you've gotten from like a messy

16:21.920 --> 16:26.160
dump of data and dealing with those problems that come up when you're trying to implement

16:26.160 --> 16:30.080
something that's more realistic that companies have to deal with.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.080
Okay.

16:31.080 --> 16:35.880
So two things, anything, and that's consistent with, so yesterday I was interviewing the

16:35.880 --> 16:42.720
startups that are part of the AI Nexus lab and I asked them all like what are the biggest

16:42.720 --> 16:47.840
challenges they're experiencing and your latter point dealing with, you know, acquiring

16:47.840 --> 16:54.080
and annotating and generally dealing with messy data is was universally like the number

16:54.080 --> 16:57.800
one challenge that they face and sounds like it's not just startups.

16:57.800 --> 17:01.600
It's that's what industry folks are telling you as well and anything else beyond those

17:01.600 --> 17:02.600
two.

17:02.600 --> 17:08.800
I think a lot of it too is like knowing how data fits in terms of strategy for an organization.

17:08.800 --> 17:13.000
I think a lot of people who are academics think, oh, you just go and do your machine learning

17:13.000 --> 17:15.200
model and check that box.

17:15.200 --> 17:20.800
But in fact, like being able to evaluate how core to the company's mission where work

17:20.800 --> 17:25.120
is and what opportunities you're going to have is a very challenging space and often

17:25.120 --> 17:29.520
it'll affect how happy you are, how will you fit into a particular job.

17:29.520 --> 17:33.680
So on that front, it's more about getting out, trying to find ways to network and learn

17:33.680 --> 17:38.160
more about, learn more from people in industry and get a sense of like what does it mean

17:38.160 --> 17:44.160
to be at a big enterprise company who's focused on NLP versus a startup that's doing computer

17:44.160 --> 17:45.160
vision stuff.

17:45.160 --> 17:49.920
Those are broadly different motivations and problems that those, those organizations

17:49.920 --> 17:50.920
have.

17:50.920 --> 17:51.920
Awesome.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.400
Well, what's next for insight?

17:53.400 --> 17:57.080
We talked a little bit about expansion, but any other, you know, programs or things

17:57.080 --> 17:58.840
that you'd want folks to know about?

17:58.840 --> 18:02.840
Yeah, we're currently thinking of ways that we might be able to work more closely with

18:02.840 --> 18:08.800
some of the teams that we work with, specifically around like helping them overcome technical

18:08.800 --> 18:14.320
hurdles because the depth of technical knowledge on our teams is quite strong and we do a lot

18:14.320 --> 18:19.480
of like in-house research in order to stay on top of the type of work that our fellows

18:19.480 --> 18:20.480
are doing.

18:20.480 --> 18:21.480
Okay.

18:21.480 --> 18:22.480
Interesting.

18:22.480 --> 18:24.320
How big is that research team?

18:24.320 --> 18:30.480
Well, so everyone's sort of like all the technical team members at insight do their own like

18:30.480 --> 18:34.360
either projects or keeping up with the latest journals.

18:34.360 --> 18:37.440
So it's not like a strongly unified team.

18:37.440 --> 18:41.440
It's more like everyone knows that they want it and they're excited to do it because frankly

18:41.440 --> 18:45.320
almost all the technical team members were people who went through the program.

18:45.320 --> 18:49.360
And so they themselves are very excited by this type of work and are eager to do it.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.360
Okay.

18:50.360 --> 18:51.360
Awesome.

18:51.360 --> 18:56.720
And work and folks learn more and like what's the, is there a link to the application or

18:56.720 --> 18:59.240
you know, what's the process for folks that are interested?

18:59.240 --> 19:00.240
Yeah.

19:00.240 --> 19:04.760
You can find all the information on our website insight data science.com.

19:04.760 --> 19:09.080
There's links to all of our programs including the white papers, which actually do a really

19:09.080 --> 19:13.080
great job of like laying out what is the difference between data science, what is the difference

19:13.080 --> 19:16.720
between data engineering, what is the difference between AI and all those things.

19:16.720 --> 19:17.720
Right.

19:17.720 --> 19:21.000
And a lot of people, especially from academia and other places like that is a hard thing

19:21.000 --> 19:24.640
to parse and it's still like kind of a hard thing to parse for a lot of people in general.

19:24.640 --> 19:25.640
Right.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.560
So great information there, including our blog posts, which give you a sense of like the

19:28.560 --> 19:30.240
type of work fellows do.

19:30.240 --> 19:31.240
Okay.

19:31.240 --> 19:34.320
And then the applications, we run these programs roughly three times a year.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.040
They can go to the apply page, simple web form.

19:37.040 --> 19:41.160
And then there's next steps if the application seems like it's good fit.

19:41.160 --> 19:42.160
Cool.

19:42.160 --> 19:44.080
That sounds like an amazing opportunity for folks.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.080
Yeah.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.080
I think so.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.080
Awesome.

19:47.080 --> 19:48.920
Well, thanks so much Ross for taking the time to chat with me.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.320
I enjoyed learning about the program.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.320
Yeah.

19:51.320 --> 19:52.320
Thank you.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.320
Awesome.
