00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,240
Hello and welcome to another episode of Tumel Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

2
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,240
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,820
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:29,680
This time around, we're doing something special here on the show and I'm really excited

5
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,620
to share it with you.

6
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:36,720
My producer and I spent some time in New York City this week, guests of the fine folks

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:43,040
from the future labs at NYU Tandon and FF Venture Capital, who are sponsors of this

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:51,080
week's show and the organizations behind the NYU FF VC AI Nexus Lab startup accelerator

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:53,160
program.

10
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,960
You might recall that I mentioned the future labs AI Summit last week, an event hosted

11
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,440
by the AI Nexus Lab to showcase the startups in their first batch, as well as the impressive

12
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,880
AI talent in the New York City ecosystem.

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,680
We attended this event on Wednesday afternoon and had an amazing time.

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,520
We got to give out a bunch of Twimmel stickers, meet some fans of the show, and check out

15
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,320
a great set of speakers.

16
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,320
I particularly enjoyed watching AI luminaries Gary Marcus and Jan LeCoon, both NYU faculty

17
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,400
and longtime friends, taking swipes at one another from the stage.

18
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,720
It was great.

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,080
I tweeted some of the highlights, which you can check out by looking me up on Twitter at

20
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,960
at Sam Charrington.

21
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,800
We had our mobile studio set up in a backstage dressing room and over the next few weeks we'll

22
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,600
be sharing some great discussions we had with some of the speakers at the event.

23
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,720
But first, we've got a monster of a show for you this week.

24
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,200
Backed from the future labs incubator space, we spoke with founders from the five companies

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,160
in the inaugural batch of the AI Nexus Lab program.

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:08,080
Hello Vera, Clustera, behold.ai, Cambrian intelligence, and Alpha Vertex.

27
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,800
These companies are doing some really interesting things and I think you'll enjoy hearing their

28
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,280
stories.

29
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,480
We also spent some time chatting with Steve Cuyin, the managing director of future labs,

30
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,320
but what makes the AI Nexus Lab program so special?

31
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,720
We're releasing all six of these interviews simultaneously for your binge listening

32
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,240
pleasure as Twilmultalk number 18, parts one through five.

33
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,760
Before we get started though, if you like what you hear, you might be interested to know

34
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,760
that applications are now open for the next AI Nexus Lab cohort.

35
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:49,200
The program gives companies $100,000 in investment capital, four months of customized programming

36
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,440
plus three additional months of free space, along with curated mentorship from leading

37
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,200
NYU academics and New York City investors, pro bono services from partners like lawyers

38
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,520
and designers, plus a paid four student fellow for the duration of the program.

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,120
Additionally, each company is partnered with an AI Nexus Lab corporate pilot partner,

40
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,440
which in the last cohort included Daimler, Quantopia, and Tough Mudder.

41
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,680
The application deadline for the program is coming up quickly.

42
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,120
It's May 3rd, and the cohort starts on July 10th.

43
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:32,240

45
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:42,280
And now, on Tourship.

46
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,520
Hello everyone, this is Sam Charrington from this week in Machine Learning and AI, and

47
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:53,000
I am live here at the NYU Future Labs Accelerator Space, and I'll be talking to several of the

48
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,200
companies from the NYU AI Nexus Accelerator.

49
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,440
And the first up here is Hello Vera.

50
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:07,120
And I'm here with James Fan and Liang Liang Zhao.

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,280
Guys, why don't you say hi?

52
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,440
So tell us a little bit about Hello Vera.

53
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,960
Yes, Hello Vera.

54
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:23,160
We are applying artificial intelligence technology to the problem of customer service.

55
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,960
As you know, customer service is a major pain point for a lot of enterprises.

56
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,840
It requires a lot of human agents.

57
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,480
It's a very costly operation, often it costs $2 for a human agent to send you an email

58
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,400
and the $5 to answer a phone call.

59
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,640
With all the money spent, customer satisfaction actually is all the time low.

60
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,680
So last year, I went to talk to Liang Liang and they said, you know what, this is a problem

61
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,080
that artificial intelligence can help a lot.

62
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,320
You know what makes human hate to do this job is this is very repetitive.

63
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:03,480
If you look at the top customer service issues, they're almost always the same issues repeating

64
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,360
over and over.

65
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,320
So that's a perfect fit for AI because the repetitive nature makes it easy for AI to

66
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,720
learn to recognize the patterns in it.

67
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,920
And then there's also a lot of data in this domain.

68
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:21,360
Every company keeps track of the previously solved tickets and how human agents have solved

69
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
the tickets.

70
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,000
You know, data is the lifeline of artificial intelligence, right?

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,080
So this data, we can use machine learning technology to learn how to resolve it just

72
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,000
like a human would.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,680
And what's better is, when you once you deploy, you have additional new data coming in.

74
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,600
So the AI technology for customer service will get better and better after it gets deployed.

75
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,000
So you're part of this accelerator now, how long have you been doing this?

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,480
We started last year, so we just about a year.

77
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,480
Okay.

78
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:03,400
And there have been a number of companies going after the customer support, the customer

79
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,800
support market, and trying to apply machine learning and AI, everything from startups to

80
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,840
you know, big companies in a space like Zendesk and others, what is unique about your

81
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:14,840
approach?

82
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,840
Right.

83
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:23,280
So if you look at the space in this, there are three type of companies.

84
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:27,920
There's one type that's doing essentially a frequently asked question search type of

85
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,720
things.

86
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,120
You know, that has a limited capabilities.

87
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,640
A second type is what we call agent assist, basically they provide tools to make human

88
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,440
agents to do their job more efficiently.

89
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,600
That's nice, but your human agent's still the bottleneck.

90
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,680
If your human agent go home, your customers won't get their questions answered until they

91
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,360
come back again.

92
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:57,360
The third type is these chat platforms that if your company have enough technology, techies

93
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:05,560
available, you can tell them to use the chat platform builders to build a chatbot.

94
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:11,000
One thing is very important to know is most of these chatbots are very script based.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,920
So if you have scripts, then one thing you find out very quickly is once you deploy, customers

96
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,200
will never behave the way you imagine they were, they don't follow the script.

97
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,600
And then your chatbot just falls apart.

98
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,480
So our approach is where you're taking machine learning data driven approach.

99
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:33,600
So it's a lot more robust and as we have more and more data, it actually gets better

100
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,600
and better.

101
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,720
And our bot actually is autonomous.

102
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,000
It gives answers in real time, instantaneously.

103
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Okay.

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,040
Can you tell me a little bit more about that?

105
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,200
I think most people who are doing AI and machine learning would characterize it as data

106
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
driven.

107
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,560
What specifically are you doing to collect and process this data to make your bot smarter?

108
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,560
Yes.

109
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,840
We have come up with a proprietary machine learning algorithm based on deep learning.

110
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,160
It's able to be a number of deep learning based approach, state or deep learning approaches,

111
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,680
a number of natural language processing tasks, as well as a number of benchmark data sets.

112
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:23,320
Our deep learning program is able to take advantage of all the data in customer service

113
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,840
domain, even starting with a small number of data, but its performance continues to improve

114
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,080
as the data gets more and more available.

115
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,320
How much data does a customer typically need to have to start off with?

116
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,240
We can start off with a very little data.

117
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:51,280
We can start off with just a dozen, two dozen instances with a dozen or two dozen question

118
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,280
answer pairs.

119
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,600
Okay.

120
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,760
And then we are able to start with running and produce answers.

121
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,320
When you're, so you start with your couple dozen question answer pairs, as you increase

122
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:13,480
the amount of data, do you also have to increase, are you also increasing labeled data or do

123
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,480
you have a way to do kind of online labeling?

124
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,480
Right.

125
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:25,880
We are actually taking advantage of users response by observing user response to infer the

126
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:31,000
label automatically and then we can able to take advantage of that.

127
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Okay.

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,720
I mentioned a bunch of technologies, deep learning and LP and others, how does that all fit

129
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,920
together to allow you to do all this?

130
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,400
So this is actually, I guess it's fairly obvious to us because we've been working in this

131
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,520
space for a long time.

132
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,600
My background is in question answering.

133
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
Okay.

134
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,880
Not enough background is machine learning.

135
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:01,320
We made IBM several years ago as researchers where you used to be at IBM research in New York

136
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,760
or in Yorktown right here outside of New York.

137
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,200
So when I was at IBM, one of the things is, I was one of the main leads for this IBM Watson

138
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,880
question answering system that you may have seen on TV that we can change at jeopardy.

139
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,760
So I've been working in this question answering domain for a long time.

140
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,400
So one of the things for us, in order to solve customer service issues, you need to figure

141
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,560
out what customer wants, understand what customer wants and the delivered answer they were

142
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,560
looking for.

143
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,160
So in order to do that, you need to use a variety of natural language processing techniques

144
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:42,560
as well as using machine learning techniques to recognize, understand what customers needs

145
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,560
are and the figure of the right answer.

146
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:54,200
And so let's take one of those deep learning, for example, how exactly are you, does deep

147
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,400
learning play into what you do?

148
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,440
Yes, so deep learning is very nice in terms of what can take full advantage of all the

149
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,800
available data to deliver high performance.

150
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,600
And as I mentioned, you know, in customer service, you can actually get quite a bit data

151
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,040
compared to a lot of other natural language processing tasks.

152
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,560
Often you can have supervised data based on the prior approach and we are taking full

153
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,280
advantage using deep learning to deliver a better performance.

154
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:30,880
And so did you, did you base your deep learning models based on, you know, some of the contemporary

155
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,040
industry research, or did you develop them all from scratch?

156
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,320
What helped you get to where you are now?

157
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,280
We are researchers, so we are very familiar with the latest trends in the research community,

158
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,800
latest works.

159
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,360
The specific deep learning approach is what we have come up on our own.

160
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:55,520
Yeah, there are a lot of things we can see about deep learning, probably the time is not

161
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
limited.

162
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
Let's get started.

163
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Yeah, just self-promoting.

164
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:04,560
I have a class teaching, I'm teaching a class at Columbia University on deep learning.

165
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,560
All the slides online, so welcome to our chat.

166
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,560
Okay.

167
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,080
Columbia class, what's the name of the class?

168
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:16,680
The deep learning for language, speech, and innovation.

169
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,680
And innovation?

170
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:26,880
Yeah, and I'm probing a little bit into how you guys are using deep learning because I

171
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,720
find that the listeners want, like, stuff that they can go and apply.

172
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:37,200
What would you tell folks that want to apply deep learning to building their own, you

173
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,520
know, speech models, and maybe even applying it to customer service?

174
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,120
What have you learned that someone else could go use?

175
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:53,240
Right, so I don't know about speech in particular, but for natural language processing, the key

176
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,120
issue is sparsity.

177
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,720
You tend to have a very high-dimensional sparse space you are working in.

178
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,880
And you want to use deep learning.

179
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:11,640
You want to reduce this dimension, high-dimension, often you have million dimension, highly-sparse

180
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,640
features.

181
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,640
You want to reduce it into a lower-dimension, dense feature space that can take advantage

182
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,480
of other aspects of deep learning easily.

183
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:27,080
And what are the features in the space that you guys are working in?

184
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,320
We use a variety of those features.

185
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,040
We actually tend to get extremely sparse, high-dimension features.

186
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:40,320
Typically, it's word, phrase, other linguistic features, etc., etc.

187
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,560
In any particular technique that you're using for the dimensionality reduction?

188
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:49,400
We are using our own proprietary projection technique.

189
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,480
Okay, for dimension reduction.

190
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,480
Okay.

191
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,520
And so how about on the NLP side of things?

192
00:13:55,520 --> 00:14:01,160
Anything interesting you can share about your approach with NLP?

193
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:07,240
One thing I can mention is, in order to, a lot of time you have, you want to start, you

194
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,200
want to have a co-start, a co-start is very important.

195
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:19,560
What it means co-start is, if you have limited amount of data, you still want to use a deep

196
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:25,520
learning approach, a co-start can give you high performance even with limited amount

197
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,720
of data.

198
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,920
And so to achieve the ability to do a cold start, are you using transfer learning or are

199
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,240
there other techniques that you're taking advantage of?

200
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,720
Yeah, we, that's one of the core technology we have.

201
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,160
It's the proprietary machine learning technique that actually can do co-start very well.

202
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
Okay.

203
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
Okay.

204
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,840
Tell me where you are as a company and where the product is as a company, are you generally

205
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,960
available?

206
00:14:53,960 --> 00:15:00,560
So our customers are large enterprises, usually we talk to customer service directors in

207
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,880
large enterprises, we apparently have two pilot partners we work with, and then we

208
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:12,000
previously licensed our technology to a Fortune 500 company for their in-house intelligent

209
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,120
agent development.

210
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:21,640
And what can you, what can you say about the kind of the process for going into a new

211
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:28,480
customer, when you, you know, they say, hey, this sounds great, we want to deploy this.

212
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,480
What does that look like?

213
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,360
What do they have to do?

214
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,240
Usually we make this process really simple, we, we go give them a demo, we, by the time

215
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,760
we talk to them, we already have a demo, using their data, they're publicly available data

216
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:49,040
up and running, so they can interact with an agent bot for their domain by the time we

217
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,200
walk in the door.

218
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,200
What does that mean?

219
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,680
They're publicly available data, most companies don't have like their support.

220
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,680
Oh, they do.

221
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,680
So think about it.

222
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,880
So for example, think about their tweets.

223
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:05,320
Oh, okay, they, they, a lot of companies provide customer service to the point, and that

224
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
data is public.

225
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,320
Okay.

226
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:12,680
And we can show how an agent behave on tweets based on their existing human agent tweets.

227
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,680
Okay.

228
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,640
So then we already have something by the time we walk in the door.

229
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,400
And of course, that's just a start, right?

230
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,920
We have, if we have more data from them, do deeper integration, our AI technology can

231
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,240
do a lot more.

232
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Okay.

233
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:33,920
And then the AI will become smarter, smarter, when he learned to interact with customer

234
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,760
and agents.

235
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:43,000
How well does, are there any issues associated with transferring or, you know, build training

236
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,480
a model on social data and then sending it off to, to go after emails?

237
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,000
Does it transfer very well or other tricks that you need to do?

238
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,640
So, so there is a little bit, the language usage, if you will, right?

239
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,960
If you look at the way people write tweets, the English is slightly different from the way

240
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,880
they write emails.

241
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,600
And you can even say, if people are on the mobile platform, then they tend to use short

242
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,600
hands for words that you otherwise wouldn't say in, if you're typing out on a full-size

243
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,600
keyboard.

244
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,360
But other than that, yes, we will be able to handle this.

245
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:29,440
So you go in, you are able to demonstrate some value to them up front based on the social

246
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,440
interactions.

247
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:37,200
And then they say, let's do this and they want to pull in, you know, more of their proprietary

248
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,200
data.

249
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:44,280
Are they, are you able to hook up to their existing systems and what systems are those,

250
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,080
are those email, or are they something like a Zendesk or a support system, or...

251
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,080
Right.

252
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,840
So you have this seamless integration with existing ticketing systems they have, whether

253
00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:00,760
that's Zendesk, Salesforce, or Oracle, or any other ticketing system.

254
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,480
So that means it's very easy for them to integrate with our system.

255
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,920
And then do they have to, do you have some kind of console that they use to label and tag

256
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,920
different interactions, or does the system do it all for them?

257
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:25,080
So we provide a dashboard which gives them a 30,000 feet overview of how things are going.

258
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,760
They can look at how many tickets are coming in, how many tickets are resolved, where the

259
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:34,080
tickets are coming from, et cetera, et cetera, and they can learn about what are the tickets

260
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,920
that stop being resolved, et cetera, et cetera.

261
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:45,360
And do you, I imagine that I'm thinking of like a, kind of, you have all these tickets

262
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:52,800
right, you have some that are being resolved, and are you showing them, is the system

263
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,120
able to figure out and display confidence levels, like, you know, we're pretty sure we

264
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,760
nail these, these, and not so sure.

265
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,400
How does that, is that just displayed on the dashboard?

266
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Yeah.

267
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,040
So we, they can store by the confidence, they can store by the time, they can store

268
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,880
by a number of these criteria, they can do the filtering to, to run report, look at

269
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,720
the tickets.

270
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:24,200
There are a number of ways for them to, to, to check to run analytics on, on their system.

271
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,600
And then I would imagine, if you're doing this a scale, another thing that would be important

272
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,960
is, for the, the things that you don't, that you haven't been able to resolve correlating

273
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,800
them so that, you know, we've got, you know, a thousand things here that we had no ability

274
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:45,760
to help out with, but we think that, you know, these two hundred are all kind of about the

275
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,760
same thing.

276
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:50,840
Is, is that something that you guys, yeah, that, that's a great idea.

277
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,600
That's exactly the direction we are heading as well.

278
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
Okay.

279
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Yeah.

280
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Maybe you should work with that.

281
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:03,080
Can you give it to the other, what are the other things that, that, you know, on that

282
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,600
topic, what are the things that are, you know, either on your roadmap or more generally,

283
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:14,120
things that you think this space needs to evolve to be able to do in order to fully realize

284
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,880
the vision for customers?

285
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,880
Yeah.

286
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,680
So I think, I think we are in, in the right space.

287
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:27,000
Our claim is, we think this space that will see more and more issues automatically resolved

288
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,480
by AI.

289
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,400
Imagine 10 years from now, I will say, overwhelming majority of customer service requests will

290
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:42,320
be automatically responded immediately, only when you have rare cases that requires human

291
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,200
attention and you'll take a little bit longer from human to come back.

292
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,160
And that's, that's across multiple channels.

293
00:20:52,160 --> 00:21:01,960
It's not just email, but also chat, social media, texting, etc., etc.

294
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,880
How did you, of all the things that you could have applied your backgrounds to, you know,

295
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,720
deep learning, NLP, all that stuff is super hot.

296
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,200
How did you come up with customer service?

297
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:21,160
So here's a story, how I thought it was a story, yes, that's always story, right?

298
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:27,240
I bought this CPU from New Egg and the New Egg has this price matching policy, right?

299
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:34,280
So the price dropped, so I called them, I was on hold and then I talked to the agent.

300
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,880
But that wasn't the first time I do this, I've done this before, this price matching

301
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
on New Egg before.

302
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,680
So I know exactly the set of questions they ask and exactly how this process works.

303
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,680
Okay.

304
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:48,760
So as I was going through this, I was, I was, I'll hold and I realized, you know, as annoying

305
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:54,440
as it is for me, that aging on the other side, he probably even more annoyed because every

306
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:58,240
day he's going through the same process over and over.

307
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,600
And that's something AI must be able to do.

308
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,800
So that's where I thought, hey, maybe I wanted to talk about, hey, maybe that's something

309
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,840
we should use AI to, to resolve, address this pain point.

310
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,440
Nice, nice.

311
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:21,040
Tell me a little bit about one of the things that companies that are, you know, marketing

312
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:27,920
AI technologies to lines of business like support, you know, have to grapple with this

313
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,240
issue of, are we, you know, replacing people, you know, augmenting people, you know, what

314
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,840
are the kinds of questions that your customers are asking and how do you help them think

315
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:43,400
through, you know, what the role of AI within, you know, with automation and these kinds

316
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
of environments?

317
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Yeah.

318
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:52,840
So clients, their number one concern is customer satisfaction and our goals are aligned.

319
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,760
Our goal is to improve customer satisfaction.

320
00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:00,840
If you look at the customer service, if you can get a 24 hour response time for email,

321
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,560
that's considered good.

322
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:07,920
And only less than half the company can achieve that goal.

323
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:14,200
By having AI there, we can reduce the response time significantly and improving the customer

324
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,120
satisfaction.

325
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,000
And from the agent point of view, what we're doing is actually making their jobs more interesting

326
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,560
instead of doing the same thing over and over, they get to do things different and more

327
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:34,800
difficult, more challenging customer service issues, making a meaningful job for those,

328
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,640
so can deliver customer satisfaction and customers.

329
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,640
Okay.

330
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,680
So the reason why the response times are so slow because they don't have enough and they

331
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,160
can't afford enough customer support people.

332
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,840
So if you can help them use those people more effectively, then it's a win-win for everybody.

333
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,840
Yeah.

334
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,840
Exactly.

335
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,840
Right.

336
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,080
Anything else you'd like to add or how can folks, you know, find you and learn more?

Awesome.

341
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,360
