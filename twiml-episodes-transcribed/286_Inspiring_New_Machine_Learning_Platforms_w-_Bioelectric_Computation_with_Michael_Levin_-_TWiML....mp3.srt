Looking forward to seeing you there.

20
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,920
All right, everyone. I am here with Michael Levin.

21
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:51,520
Michael is a professor of biology and director of the Allen Discovery Center at Tufts University.

22
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,120
Michael, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

23
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,320
Thank you so much, pleasure to be here.

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,960
So you gave a talk just this afternoon to a gigantic room here at the Neurops conference.

25
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,080
Your talk was on a couple of themes that I have found fascinating just from the summary

26
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,760
of it, developmental bioelectricity and some of the implications for machine learning.

27
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:20,240
Why don't we have you get started by telling us a little bit about your background and

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,320
then we'll dive into the topic of your talk.

29
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,320
Sure.

30
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,160
My background originally was computer science.

31
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,200
I did software engineering for a number of years.

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,320
I got an undergrad degree in computer science.

33
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,440
I then went to graduate school for biology.

34
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,880
So I have a PhD in genetics and then I did postdoctoral training in cell biology and my lab

35
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,960
does a number of things in developmental biology and regenerative biology and computer science

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:51,040
all around the theme of information processing and computation in living systems.

37
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,240
So we are interested in how living biological systems process information and compute at

38
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,240
all scales, molecular tissue level, cell level, behavioral and so on.

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:07,920
Maybe you can give us kind of a broad survey of what the current thinking is around biological

40
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:08,920
computation.

41
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,040
It's not something that I've had a lot of exposure to.

42
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,280
No, and this is very much an emerging field and in fact there are lots of divergent opinions

43
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,000
and approaches at this point in this area.

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,280
It's a very exciting time.

45
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,960
My particular area comes in trying to understand how cells and tissues interact to revise the

46
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,960
anatomical plan of the body.

47
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,960
So we all start life as a single cell.

48
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:38,280
The fertilized egg gives rise to a bunch of early embryonic cells and these have to arrange

49
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,800
themselves into a particular anatomical structure.

50
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,000
So it might be a tree or a snake or an elephant or a human or whatever.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,520
But all of these cells have to figure out what to do to make this appropriate structure and

52
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,200
in fact it's much more than simply creating that structure.

53
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,240
Some animals are highly regenerative which means that you can for example if certain body

54
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,880
parts are amputated they will regrow those parts, so salamanders will regrow legs and

55
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,920
eyes and jaws and portions of the brain.

56
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,200
And these kind of examples and many others that I show today illustrate a remarkable capability

57
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,480
of biological systems to do flexible dynamic remodeling that is they don't simply create

58
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,680
a structure as some sort of a pre-written set of instructions but they can modify on

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,560
the fly to repair towards a particular goal state, a coherent organism.

60
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,120
So when a salamander regenerates its limb for example, it stops exactly when the limb

61
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,480
reaches its correct size and shape.

62
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,240
And so the question then for regenerative medicine is not only to try to trigger this

63
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,800
kind of regenerative ability, we certainly work on this in our lab is to try to kickstart

64
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,760
regeneration in human patients down the line but also to understand how the whole system

65
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:55,080
knows when to stop and for us regeneration is primarily a computational problem, the

66
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,240
tissues need to know that they've been damaged, they need to know what to do to repair and

67
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,520
they need to know when it's done.

68
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,520
And these are all questions that really are very much not understood today.

69
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,320
This is kind of blowing my mind I think for those of us outside of the field of biology

70
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,920
like we know that bodies do these things and you know the answer is just oh it's DNA right

71
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,160
the DNA controls all of this stuff but to think of it as a computational process that's

72
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,800
a totally new way of thinking about it for me.

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,840
Yeah so this is very common and in fact so I gave a version of this talk to a bunch

74
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:33,880
of middle school kids last year and I asked them I showed them a picture of an egg and I asked

75
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,080
them what actually determines what comes out of this egg it could be a snake, a turtle,

76
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,360
a dinosaur or whatever and even the nine year olds all said DNA it's DNA.

77
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,680
Well in a certain sense it is DNA but the thing to realize is that if in this age of genomics

78
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,120
if you actually sequence the genome understand the genome says has information about proteins

79
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,960
there is nothing directly that you could read out of a genome that would tell you how

80
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,280
many limbs and the creature was going to have or what type of a body symmetry it was going

81
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,560
to have whether it was going to be regenerative or not or any of these other things there

82
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,680
none of this is directly encoded in the DNA what you see in the DNA is just the proteins.

83
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,320
How do we know like have we cracked the code to I mean we know we can sequence the genome

84
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,880
and know the protein sequence but how do we know that that isn't somehow encoding

85
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,440
you know some of these more discrete properties.

86
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,800
Well it's a subtle thing so what the DNA I'll jump right into the kind of the middle

87
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,960
of the talk so what I did at the beginning of the talk was to try to set up a couple

88
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:43,000
of things that may be surprising to people so one is this amazing ability of bodies to

89
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
repair themselves.

90
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,680
I showed one for example this creature known as the planarion flatworm and these flatworms

91
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,440
are able to regenerate any part of their body so they can be chopped into pieces.

92
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,520
Every piece knows what a complete planarion looks like it regrows exactly what's necessary

93
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,840
no more no less.

94
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,960
I also showed unicellular organisms that have one cell that are just a no brain just one

95
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,400
cell but that are incredibly adept at behavior at changing their body changing their structure

96
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,280
in order to fit their environment and so on so I tried to get across the importance of

97
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,400
understanding this kind of decision making in biological tissues.

98
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,040
Now the DNA code has been cracked we know we know exactly what the DNA actually encodes

99
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:25,080
the DNA actually encodes proteins.

100
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,360
Now down the line of course in an important sense the DNA produces everything you need

101
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,160
for the hardware of the body so the proteins that are in the genome that's what your

102
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,480
body is going to be made of okay so so hardware is critical without hardware you get nothing

103
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:44,000
however hardware is only half the story so the hardware that is produced by the DNA some

104
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,880
of these proteins are electrical conduits known as ion channels and the thing about these

105
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:55,000
ion channels is they can operate as little transistors they can some of them are voltage

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,400
gated current conductances just like transistors and this means that the hardware produced

107
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,360
by that genome is electrically active and it's not only electrically active but the circuits

108
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,600
that are present in these cells produce some very complex behaviors that allow symmetry

109
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,720
breaking self-organization and decision making in terms of pattern control at the large

110
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,320
scale so whole tissues whole organs whole appendages of bodies so so yes the DNA is critical

111
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,120
in that it establishes the hardware but the software that runs on this hardware is

112
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:31,720
not directly encoded anywhere in the DNA it is the result of the electrical activity another

113
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,160
way the DNA establishes the hardware which creates the software that controls all these things

114
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,840
essentially there's a there's a default software that will run on this hardware if it's

115
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:47,240
unperturbed but the cool thing about the software is that it's very it's very plastic and

116
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,640
it's written and and it operates in such a way that it's it makes it very easy for us

117
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,760
to rewrite it and so that means that we can intervene and I show numerous examples of

118
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,120
of us learning to intervene in the software to make the to make the body into shapes that

119
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:09,480
are entirely not what the genome default is so for talking about things like crisper or not

120
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,600
at all no so no genomic and once again no not whatsoever so the interesting thing about this

121
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,560
approach what makes it different is that another point I tried to make in the talk is that

122
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,680
computer science the reason the reason computer science was able to drive this incredible

123
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:30,120
revolution in information technology is that we moved from having to program at the level of

124
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,720
hardware which is where we were in the 40s you know if you wanted to program a computer you had

125
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,600
to get in there and shift wires around that was how we program but now because of the appreciation

126
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:44,600
of the hardware software distinction we are able to work at these in these high level programming

127
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,600
formalisms where you can think about the information flow the algorithm and you're not worried about

128
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,640
what the underlying hardware is because if the hardware is good enough it can run lots of different

129
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,720
kinds of software and at that point you can forget about the hardware and really focus on the algorithm

130
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,160
our biological hardware is good enough it is it is complex enough that it is able to run all

131
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,440
sorts of interesting physiological software there is some default that comes with if you don't touch

132
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,280
it this is what it's going to do but it is also a label such that we can rewrite it and so what I've

133
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:21,240
shown is rewriting the software without touching the hardware meaning control what happens by input

134
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,800
and experience rather than by changing the circuitry the there are two analogies that I will put

135
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:31,880
in forward one is at this point we program the compute we program our computers not by getting

136
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,280
in there and melting bits of silicon here and there but we have a keyboard we have a way of

137
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:41,400
entering information not re not rewiring the the physical hardware so everybody understands

138
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,400
that the same piece of hardware if it's if it's decent can run lots of different types of software

139
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:50,600
and the way you change it is by providing inputs that shift the electrical dynamics of the system

140
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:56,920
without having to change the structure of it the other analogies with the brain so the DNA certainly

141
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:01,400
includes all of the proteins instructions for all of the proteins that are required to make up your

142
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,440
brain but the information content of your brain is nowhere in the genome and you couldn't dream of

143
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,880
reading out the content of a person's memories and their mind or animals by looking at the genome

144
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,360
what you may recover from the genome is some default instinctual behavior so for example

145
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,640
let's say some insects wasps you know they're born knowing how to build a you know a thing to catch

146
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,360
prey and all this so the genome certainly gives rise to a neural network whose default behavior

147
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,120
includes these kinds of interesting things that insects do but other animals are also able to

148
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,080
learn and this means that you can have experiential inputs information that they get through the

149
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,200
visual through other senses that radically change what their behavior is going to be down the line

150
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:49,240
many circuits in the body have this kind of interesting plastic property so some of the things

151
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,880
that I've shown today for example one of the one of the examples was we can take a flatworm

152
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,640
that has a very particular shaped head and we can very transiently briefly alter the electrical

153
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:05,880
properties of that of that animal such that when it regenerates a new head it will make heads

154
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:11,240
appropriate to other species of flatworms other species 150 million years different so the shape

155
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,400
of the head is different the shape of the brain is different the stem cell distribution is

156
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:21,000
appropriate to a completely different animal 150 million years distant the genome is untouched

157
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,120
there's that we did not touch the genomic sequence because what the genomic sequence encodes

158
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,160
is a body that can build a number of different types of structures one of those structures is this

159
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:38,280
other type of plenary and head I've shown other examples where we can induce different parts of

160
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:43,560
the body so for example we can make a chunk of the gut of a frog embryo become an eye and again

161
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,120
this is this is the same thing because one of the things these electrical as it turns out

162
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:54,440
one of the things these electrical networks do is they specify large scale anatomical

163
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:01,240
decisions for the body and so the decision of what organ shall I make at any given space in

164
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:06,760
the any given location in the body is dictated by the outcome of a complex electrical circuit

165
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,680
downstream of that electrical circuit are all the familiar things people have heard about so

166
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:16,040
transcriptional cascades genes turning on and off physical forces tension stresses between cells

167
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:23,640
cells moving around chromatin states so all of these kinds of things but many of these important

168
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,560
decisions are made upstream by an electrical circuit and we have the opportunity to intervene

169
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:34,600
and I've shown I showed a number of examples of this where we can repair things that for example

170
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:41,160
animals in which defects have been induced in genes that are required for brain development for

171
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:48,360
example so we showed a is a bioelectrical fix which is a strategy that repairs their brain so

172
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:54,040
basically by forcing the appropriate electrical states in that region of the body they will build

173
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,800
a correct brain with the correct structure correct function and even correct behavior so

174
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,960
these animals get their IQs back despite the fact that they've had a genetic mutation that

175
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,800
normally takes out the brain completely or that they've been exposed to a variety of

176
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,520
horrible toeratogens that normally cause really terrible defects so there's the genome there's

177
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:17,560
the default set of things that happen normally but that layer is very rich and we get to intervene

178
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:22,680
and make a number of changes this is incredible this kind of suggests that at least at some point

179
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:28,040
you know there's a possibility of bioelectric medicine or we have any you know for humans do we

180
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,160
have any you know early indications of that being possible yeah very much so so so we're working

181
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,440
exactly on this we're working on applications like limb regeneration tumor reprogramming repair

182
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:44,120
of birth defects all of these things I think are going to be part of human medicine and one of

183
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:50,840
the important things is that something like 20% of all drugs are ion channels blockers or activators

184
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,800
so this means that there's a huge kind of already of starting to do this well not so so they're

185
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,680
all used for things like cardiac arrhythmias epilepsy so so people use them to target neurons

186
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:09,160
but my big message today was that neurons are simply a sped up a sort of accelerated version

187
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:15,960
of much more primitive ancient cells so cells were were were processing information in networks

188
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,760
long before brains and neurons came on the scene and while all of these drugs right now are being

189
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:28,760
are being developed for problems in in cardiac and neural and neural kinds of syndromes they form

190
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,760
this amazing toolkit of electrosuticals that we've begun to apply them towards problems in tumor

191
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,800
reprogramming regenerative induction repair and so on and so I absolutely think this is going

192
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,320
to be part of human medicine yeah one of the things that you were talking about in your talk

193
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:51,080
was this notion of right rewriting pattern memories is that you know this general concept that

194
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,720
we've been discussing or is there is more specific meaning to that well I can give you a specific

195
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:02,440
example but it's part of that same that same idea one of the things that we we we know is that

196
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,200
even our unicellular ancestors so single cells before they became multicellular already had

197
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:14,040
a lot of the machinery that we associate with decision making and cognition so synaptic proteins

198
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,400
eye on channels um neuro transmitters these things are extremely ancient and cells and tissues

199
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:26,600
were processing this information before we had brains uh this is um the the the the way that they

200
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:32,920
that they do this is by storing a bioelectric prepatterns that are um guideposts for what they're

201
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:38,760
going to do if they're damaged so we I show today an example where we can take a flower and in an

202
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:43,560
intact flower you can actually see we've developed techniques to visualize some of these electrical

203
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:48,840
memories we can see these as stable electrical states and tissues and we can go in and rewrite them

204
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,240
and when we rewrite them what happens is initially nothing because that that memory is latent

205
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,160
it's not being used but if that animal gets injured in the future so let's say we cut its head

206
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,800
and its tail off that middle fragment with a rewritten pattern memory will then go on to

207
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,960
regenerate two heads one at each end so no tail two heads at each end and this is because we gave

208
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,360
it a false memory we gave it a false now this is a different kind of memory it's not the kind of

209
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,600
memory that lives in the brain about behavior this is a memory that's distributed across the whole

210
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:22,120
body that determines the behavior of the cells as they will try to recreate what they think a worm

211
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,200
looks like and this representation of the fact that a worm is supposed to have one head and one

212
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,800
tail is not set in stone we can rewrite it and that's what we've done it also calls to mind the

213
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:39,800
whole idea of biological memory systems like the you know the human brain from a kind of storage

214
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:46,760
perspective is a way more efficient memory store than DRAM you know that we use in computers is

215
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,680
are there clear implications to that yes I absolutely so there are a number of applications of

216
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:58,920
this work to machine learning into AI in general certainly living tissue is an incredibly dense

217
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:05,320
information medium there are networks made of cells within with inside of each cell there are

218
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,920
incredibly complex molecular and also some some cellular networks things like the cytoskeleton

219
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:17,000
which process information in a distributed fashion in an incredibly dense and rich way so so I

220
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,480
think as as new media as new excitable unconventional media for computation biological tissues have

221
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,160
a lot to teach us I think that's that's absolutely true the other the is some of the other

222
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:37,480
implications are that biological systems are very very good at adaptively altering their behavior

223
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,480
and function in light of novel stressors so the the the problem that we a or a problem that we

224
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:47,240
currently have in machine learning where some of these applications are really brittle the very

225
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,240
good at doing one thing you shift them to a slightly different problem and everything falls apart

226
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,720
living things are the exact opposite of that we have many examples of living structures that can

227
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:03,480
adaptively respond to novel stressors in in a very kind of efficient way and and this is

228
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,320
something that we badly need in in robotics and machine learning and I think we're going to be able

229
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,800
to get that by observing how cells and tissues make decisions in the kinds of experiments that we

230
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:19,640
deal with a lot of the mechanisms of machine learning are you know the manipulation of probability

231
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:28,440
distributions do these kinds of bioelectric systems and signals within within the body or other

232
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:35,080
organisms do they exhibit the same kind same kind of probabilistic nature they do they do so so

233
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:41,800
we've we've we've characterized several kinds of stochastic decision making but pretty much we

234
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:49,000
have a we have an interesting review on this on this whole question pretty much every major concept

235
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,320
in neuroscience and cognitive science that we've been able to find has an analog in somatic

236
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:00,920
decision making so everything you can think of from from memories to optical illusions to false

237
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:08,520
memories to forgetting to inference to making mistakes to calculating forward do for expectations

238
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,600
in terms of anticipation all of these concepts and many more have exact analogs outside the body

239
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,840
and I think one outside the brain rather and I think one of the major implications of all this

240
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:26,040
is that in developing new AI and machine learning technologies we should not be trying to mimic

241
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:33,480
the human brain I think that a focus on architectures that try to mimic specific regions of the brain

242
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:39,640
or specific processes in the brain or or specific architectures really looking at one very narrow

243
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,840
and and fairly recent evolutionary development the the kinds of things that we really want which

244
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:51,640
is robust distributed highly plastic performance and decision making these were things that were

245
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,080
invented long before brains came on the scene and those those basic mechanisms still remain to be

246
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:05,880
investigated and implemented in in machine learning. Are there any kind of concrete examples of

247
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:12,040
the intersection of machine learning and developmental bio electricity to date or are you projecting

248
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:16,760
into the future into a direction we need to go? There's two I think there's two branches of this

249
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,880
on the one hand it's the question of what can machine learning do for regenerative medicine

250
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:28,680
and we have begun to develop and we need a lot more help with this and a lot more progress is

251
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:35,080
available this is a hugely exciting frontier area of using machine learning technology and

252
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:42,840
strategies to help developmental biologists solve the problem of of pattern control what we what

253
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:49,720
biologists are very very good at is characterizing the molecular details of the hardware we are

254
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,000
basically where computer science was in the 40s all we do is try to interface with the hardware

255
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,440
we try to push push around single molecules you know whether the the the fanciest papers in nature

256
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:04,440
are all about how somebody can do something at single molecule resolution this is what we're very

257
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:10,680
good at or terrible at is solving the inverse problem of asking what do we need to tweak at the

258
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:15,720
low level to get a desired systems level outcome so if somebody's if if we have a fetus that's

259
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:22,360
going to have three fingers instead of five the question of what exactly do we need to tweak at

260
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,560
the lowest level to get a particular outcome or to fix a certain organ or the shape of the face

261
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:34,680
or something like this we're actually really really bad at that and so using meanwhile the data

262
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,840
on these low level pathways grows exponentially so so people keep sequencing things the the this

263
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:47,880
kind of deep data is just increasing in an incredible fashion but but this is already exceeded

264
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:53,800
the human ability to synthesize all of these data into some sort of model that can be that can

265
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,920
be reversed so that we can ask what would we have to do to get a particular anatomical outcome

266
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:03,400
so machine learning tools to help us with this problem are absolutely essential for regenerative

267
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:07,800
medicine to move forward in and we've had a little bit of success with us we've developed some

268
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,880
some genetic algorithm based machine learning platforms that have actually helped us discover

269
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,760
models of how some of these things work it's it's kind of amazing we we made what I think is the

270
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:25,240
first is a couple years ago what I think is the first example of a model in developmental biology

271
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,960
that was discovered by a non-human intelligence so basically of a platform that was able to

272
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,280
derive a model not just crunch the numbers but actually come up with a theory of what was going

273
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,000
on what was going on inside that plenary and flatworm that was better able to explain all the

274
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,760
experiments than existing models that humans have come up with so I think this is the tip of the

275
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:49,080
iceberg we have to do do better with this and give people tools to help extract wisdom from

276
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,480
this mountain of data that we have going in the opposite direction this is really just starting

277
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,200
and I don't have anything specific to point to other than people have started to look at things

278
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:05,320
like slime molds like ant colonies like bacterial biofilms as models for computation and there are

279
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,880
people like Andrew Ratamatsky and others who are using some of these kinds of unconventional media

280
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:18,120
as a very simple computers with the idea of understanding how they do what they do and trying to

281
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,640
implement some of these advantages in robotics and and we're doing this too we have collaborations

282
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,440
with people like Josh Bondgard at University of Vermont who make robots and trying to really

283
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,560
squeeze some some insights out of these biological systems for much better technology.

284
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,680
Really fascinating work Michael thanks so much for taking the time to share with us any kind of

285
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:46,200
final thoughts or suggestions for folks that want to dig into this in a little bit more detail.

286
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,080
Yeah the biggest thing I can I can suggest is to drop me an email because we are always very

287
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,760
interested in collaborating with people from the machine learning community I think there are

288
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:01,080
huge opportunities in both directions for enriching the progress and so you can reach me at

289

290
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,120
all of the all of the data we have there's a lot of code that we've written and I would love to

291
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:16,280
talk to experts in this field for working together. Fantastic thanks so much Michael thank you very
