00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,880
Hey, what's up everyone? Sam Charrington here, host of this week in Machine Learning

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,360
and AI Podcast, bringing you a look at my recent trip to the Consumer Electronic Show

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,000
and Las Vegas.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,280
CES is one of those things that's hard to fully comprehend without having seen, so I thought

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:21,360
it'd be fun to give you a look at it from my vantage point.

6
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,920
In this special YouTube exclusive, we're going to check out some of the interesting examples

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,600
of Machine Learning and AI that I found at the event.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,200
As you'd expect, there were a ton of robots on display at CES this year, but this enormous

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,600
combine harvester in the John Deere booth might be one of the biggest bots you'll ever

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,600
see.

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,200
I spent some time speaking with Dears Tavanga, Ciavora, learning about the autonomy and

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,320
computer vision tech built into this bad boy.

13
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,320
Check it out.

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,600
I'm here at the John Deere booth with Tavanga, who is telling me that there is a long history

15
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,600
of autonomy in these foreign vehicles, you said you've been doing it for how long?

16
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,600
Certainly.

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,200
John Deere has been doing a self-driving for over 15 years now, and we actually have the

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,600
accuracy level with our equipment down to plus or minus 2.5 centimeters of accuracy

19
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,840
for a piece of equipment of this size and scale.

20
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,080
So, yeah, here at CES this year we're excited about telling that story, and also many of

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,600
the other technologies we continue to evolve.

22
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,920
Here at the stand, we've been talking through some of our advancements in machine learning

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,160
and computer vision, and also looking at we're going next with artificial intelligence

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,360
or recent purchase of blue river technologies, and really how John Deere is trying to help

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,880
farmers continue to feed the world.

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,600
And you mentioned that there's computer vision and work at work in this combine.

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,600
So, what's a lot of that?

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,880
So, one thing we're really excited about with the new S700 series, Combine, what you're

29
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
seeing here.

30
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,840
We have some camera technology that's now embedded into the key aspects of the Combine.

31
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,000
So, what you're seeing here is the grain elevator, right?

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,600
Think of the Combine as a factory on wheels that's going through that corn field harvesting,

33
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:09,480
and what's coming out up here is actually the desired product, Dipper, a harvesting corn

34
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,320
for example, there's going to be kernels coming up here, and what's coming out the back

35
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,920
of the Combine is going to be compost, right?

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,920
So, it's going to be chopped up pieces of stock leaves, and all of that, and stuff you don't

37
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
want.

38
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,160
Well, yes, actually farmers actually do want to keep that on the field because then it

39
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,000
puts nutrients back into the soil, right?

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,400
So, hey, they're here, they're just done for.

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:37,560
So, what I was talking through earlier is, as that material is coming up, now our equipment

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:44,360
is able to allow the operator of the equipment to also program, and in essence have the machine

43
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,480
make those adjustments for them, which is an essence taken care of what is the farmer's

44
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,480
payday, right?

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,320
So, they've been investing quite a bit, and so that crop cycle, so it's making those adjustments

46
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,520
for them on the fly.

47
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:01,120
These days, the average farmer for the U.S. farmer is about 5,000 acres, and for these guys,

48
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,080
it's a very narrow window of time, so there are times working, you know, 12 to 16 hour

49
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,080
days.

50
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,040
So, both through driving or self-driving equipment, through this computer vision and automation,

51
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,240
this and our equipment today, it actually helps them do so more productively.

52
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,920
Right, and with the computer vision in particular, the result is higher yield and less foreign

53
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,920
matter in the...

54
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
Certainly, certainly.

55
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,560
So, you know, think about this way.

56
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,560
As we mentioned earlier, as they're going through harvesting, that's the farmer's payday,

57
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,560
right?

58
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,280
So, we're trying to help them maintain the best quality grain that's collected, and

59
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,280
also make sure that with those tailings or what's coming out of the back of the combine,

60
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,040
they aren't losing any of that grain also.

61
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
Awesome.

62
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,040
Thank you.

63
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,400
Pretty cool, right?

64
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,640
Of course, there were also a ton of drones here at CES.

65
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:53,960
While they're getting smarter and smarter each year, one startup is attempting to give

66
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,280
drones superhero-like powers.

67
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,280
All right, cool.

68
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,280
I'm here with Leah with AstroAR.

69
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,800
What's AstroAR up to?

70
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Oh, man.

71
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
Okay.

72
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
So, we build drones that stop bullets.

73
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,840
We've developed a sensor array.

74
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,080
We're performing sensor fusion directly on the drone.

75
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,080
It's all edge.

76
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,720
And Vidya Inception partner, that's how we're able to do this.

77
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,520
That's how we're able to get the type of hardware necessary to run those machine learning

78
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:23,600
algorithms directly on the drone, doing all of this edge millimeter wave radio frequency,

79
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,600
combined with computer vision, and other sensors I can't really delve into.

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,880
But I assure you the ability to detect the difference between a fake gun and a real gun,

81
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,600
a loaded gun and an unloaded gun, we can read the writing on the facts in the shell casings

82
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,600
loaded into the gun.

83
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Wow.

84
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,880
And now when I hear a drone that stops bullets, I think of like Wonder Woman bracelets and

85
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,840
like getting in front of the bullets in real time, that's not really what this is doing.

86
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,160
Not exactly.

87
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Because the drone is able to identify the gun, the presence of a firearm in advance, we

88
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,360
identify this as an anomaly, not a firearm.

89
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,560
It's just an object of interest for which a police officer is made aware of.

90
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,440
We're not trying to take anybody's guns, but you can't shoot people.

91
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,920
The drone will take up a position that we refer to as guardian angel mode.

92
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,200
We'll get ready to get involved.

93
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,280
Now, it assesses threat based on the proximity of a hand to a gun, any hand, any gun.

94
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,240
So yes, they are absolutely, they're absolutely capable of getting in the way from that vantage

95
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,240
point.

96
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,680
And also, there is a human reflex that we are exploiting in order to ensure that this

97
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
works.

98
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:33,080
Do you remember, do you remember how Sarah Connor, she's running at that security guy?

99
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:37,840
He knows how dangerous she is and yet, when she tosses the keys to him, his hands come

100
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,840
up.

101
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,840
Yeah.

102
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,840
Yeah.

103
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,840
That is a human reflex.

104
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,840
It is universal.

105
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,840
The drones will rush you.

106
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,080
They will make themselves the most interesting thing in your world for about the next 30

107
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,080
seconds.

108
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,600
They will be extremely difficult to ignore.

109
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,440
It's like ignoring a flying blender.

110
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:59,920
If you're familiar with the canine technique of bark and hold, it's a canine can be trained

111
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:03,680
to rush someone, they'll jump up and down and bark.

112
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Yeah.

113
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,680
Bark, bark, bark, bark.

114
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,680
Yeah.

115
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,040
You're getting a live pseudo live demonstration of bark and hold here.

116
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Yeah.

117
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,040
I'm a bark and hold.

118
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,880
It's what that's called, when police do it.

119
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,000
And it's impossible to ignore that dog.

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,160
Exactly the same principle.

121
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,360
It is impossible to ignore those rotors.

122
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,600
Those rotors are, it's loud, it's making noise.

123
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,920
We have red and blue.

124
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,360
You're absolutely right.

125
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,360
Yeah.

126
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,840
So you've got millimeter wave technology that sounds like it can see through walls and

127
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,560
objects and determined.

128
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,360
The sensors that we use are actually capable of detecting cancer over the air.

129
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,600
We repurpose them for this.

130
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Okay.

131
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
And so you're just.

132
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,800
They originally designed to perform a, it's basically a handheld MRI.

133
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Okay.

134
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Yeah.

135
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
And so what's the range?

136
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
10 meters.

137
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,800
Okay.

138
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
It's about 30 feet.

139
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,120
Now these work best in pairs.

140
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,640
So about 60 feet.

141
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,640
Yeah.

142
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,640
Okay.

143
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:05,640
And so it detects that there's a gun present and kind of takes a guardian angel position.

144
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,640
And it also sounds like you're doing some kind of pose detection to deter, like pose detection.

145
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,640
Do it to a certain extent, to a certain extent.

146
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,640
Yes.

147
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
This.

148
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,640
It's probably.

149
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,640
It's predicted by.

150
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,640
Yeah.

151
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
The city of hand to gun.

152
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
Okay.

153
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:28,640
That hand touches that gun and it's your program activates.

154
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,640
The only thing getting shot is a drone.

155
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Yeah.

156
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,640
Right.

157
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Yeah.

158
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
That's this is the armor.

159
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,640
Oh, this is one of the armors.

160
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,640
This is the raw armor.

161
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Raw.

162
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:44,640
The produce armor has a backing of ceramic or Kevlar or you know, it's built up with you.

163
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,640
Build a proof of acrylic.

164
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Okay.

165
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,640
It's a composite.

166
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
It is a composite.

167
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,640
And I mean, believe it or not, we actually have bulletproof panions.

168
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,640
I know, right?

169
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
I'm not even kidding.

170
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,640
I'm not kidding.

171
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,640
It works.

172
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,640
What can I say?

173
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,640
So I mentioned the.

174
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Come on over.

175
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,640
Come on over.

176
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,640
What's that?

177
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Move out of the way.

178
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,640
Dude, you're blocking our.

179
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,640
Yeah.

180
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
I mentioned the trajectory thing.

181
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
The pose detection.

182
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Yeah.

183
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
Because you mentioned trajectory tracking.

184
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,640
Yeah, trajectory tracking.

185
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,640
The has has most.

186
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,640
It's most focused on what is the gun doing in the hand.

187
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,640
So it kind of estimates the departure angle of the bullet from the gun and gets in the way based on that.

188
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Yeah.

189
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
I mean, you're going to.

190
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
It's also trying to provoke you to aim at it.

191
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Okay.

192
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
Yeah.

193
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:31,640
So this is very much an active process that it is trying to get you to, hey, I'm over here.

194
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:32,640
Hey, I'm over here.

195
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
Pay attention to me.

196
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,640
Um, for God's sakes, we make the armor shiny.

197
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Okay.

198
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,640
And so it sounds like it's pretty, uh, inference heavy.

199
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,640
You're not kind of sending information to a cloud and waiting for.

200
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
We're not.

201
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,640
We absolutely.

202
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,640
If we tried to send this over the cloud, someone would get killed.

203
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,640
So what are you using on device?

204
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Uh, no, we're like I said, we're an Nvidia inception startup.

205
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,640
We are, uh, we're also arrow partners and we are.

206
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
It's like a Jetson or.

207
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,640
Uh, what's the Xavier?

208
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,640
Okay.

209
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,640
Yeah, we're using Xavier's.

210
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,640
I know Xavier's.

211
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
These are TX 2's.

212
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
We're.

213
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
We're not going to bring.

214
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
We're not going to bring the Xavier's.

215
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
Well, taking that down out the block.

216
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,640
Sorry, guys.

217
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Um, yeah.

218
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
And this is the model of the.

219
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Uh, yeah, that's what's going on.

220
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,640
That's being too arrow.

221
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Let's throw that we use.

222
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,640
As you can see, we also incorporate.

223
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
These are, this is a D415.

224
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,640
Um, that we've incorporated.

225
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
We have an excellent relationship with Intel.

226
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
An excellent relationship with Nvidia.

227
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,640
An excellent relationship with arrow.

228
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Um, and we are producing some custom hardware, some custom

229
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,640
silicon in order to achieve these purposes.

230
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,640
So what are the key things you've had to learn from a machine learning

231
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,640
and AI perspective or deep learning perspective?

232
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,640
A lot easier and a lot more straightforward than people seem to think.

233
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:43,640
Okay.

234
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Yeah.

235
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,640
I mean, quite frankly, this has much.

236
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,640
That and the FBI doesn't like it when I talk about this too much.

237
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,640
I mean, I want to, I want to deep dive this.

238
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,640
I love it.

239
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,640
So I mean.

240
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
But there's only so much I can say.

241
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,640
Okay.

242
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Yeah.

243
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,640
Got it.

244
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,640
Well, very cool application.

245
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,640
I hope this works out.

246
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,640
Absolutely, absolutely.

247
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Oh, there's one last thing I would like to say.

248
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
No, we do not weaponize the drones ever under any circumstances.

249
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,640
We will not add pepper spray.

250
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,640
We will not add a taser.

251
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,640
We will not add anything that will make this into a weapon.

252
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,640
It is a shield that is its job.

253
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
Yes, you can defeat it with a t-shirt.

254
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,640
You go right ahead.

255
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,640
That's like messing with the cops canine.

256
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
You see what happens.

257
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,640
Yeah.

258
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,640
Now, you wouldn't know it by the name, but CES continues to showcase

259
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,640
more and more enterprise-oriented innovations each year.

260
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:34,640
One enterprise robotics vendor, Omron, uses a ping pong playing robot

261
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,640
that's actually not for sale to demonstrate their industrial chops.

262
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,640
How did this work?

263
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,640
So this is forpious.

264
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,640
Our fifth generation AI equipped table tennis shooter

265
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,640
and essentially it uses machine vision to monitor the player

266
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,640
to watch the player's body language also how they swing the paddle

267
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,640
and then also how the where the ball is.

268
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,640
And use AI to compare that to how it was taught from an expert player.

269
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,640
So it'll use that and actually try to teach the player to get better.

270
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,640
So it uses the vision to analyze, you know, to see where the ball is.

271
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,640
It uses the AI to analyze how the player is playing against the other

272
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
and how to help them improve.

273
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,640
And it also uses IT control to be able to get the robotics in the right place

274
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,640
to be able to actually play and keep the rallies going.

275
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
Okay, and how many cameras are involved?

276
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,640
There's five cameras.

277
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,640
Five.

278
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,640
Yeah.

279
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,640
Where are they located?

280
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:26,640
So they're actually in the front.

281
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,640
So if you look in front, they're all facing the player looking down

282
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,640
and again watching the player, watching the paddle, watching the ball.

283
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,640
And this isn't a product you sell.

284
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
What's the, why do you show this here?

285
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,640
Yeah, even though we do get offers to sell it,

286
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
it is actually just a demonstration of our technology.

287
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:45,640
We actually, we use the same technology in industrial automation,

288
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,640
healthcare, in mobility, and also energy management.

289
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,640
So this is, this is kind of fun, but those other places are what it does for a living.

290
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,640
Okay.

291
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,640
So here's an industrial automation application of some of the same technology you've seen before.

292
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,640
If you look at the robot behind me, it's doing a pick and place application

293
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,640
which is very typical in a factory automation setting.

294
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
Kind of pick and place.

295
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,640
So basically picking up something from one conveyor to one place

296
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
and sorting it and putting it somewhere else.

297
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
Okay.

298
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,640
So it's a job that is not really good for humans to do because it's repetitive.

299
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:17,640
So it's an example of being able to take an unsafe job

300
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,640
and even be able to do it with a robot.

301
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,640
And it's using the same technologies in terms of computer vision

302
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,640
and path planning and the like.

303
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Right.

304
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:26,640
Exactly.

305
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,640
So if the, there is, there's vision similar to what's being used in portbius

306
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,640
looking at the conveyor line to find and locate the items that are on the conveyor line.

307
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,640
And then the same robot that's usually used for the paddle is also being used

308
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,640
in a pick and place application here.

309
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,640
If you were a fan of our AI in sports series last year,

310
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,640
you would love CES.

311
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,640
There were a bunch of really exciting sports tech applications on display there.

312
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,640
One interesting one was this AI powered boxing trainer,

313
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:57,640
bot boxer, which can be yours for just $20,000.

314
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,640
This is Bob Boxer.

315
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,640
It's an intelligent luching bag.

316
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,640
It can move.

317
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,640
But you can also see your shots.

318
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,640
So it tries to attract multiple points to your body

319
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,640
and tries to predict where the shot is going to come from.

320
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,640
So it's using computer vision to do that?

321
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,640
It's using computer vision.

322
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,640
Yeah.

323
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,640
And with time, it also learns your style.

324
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
Okay.

325
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,640
And so it can look at you and it can try and tease you.

326
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,640
It can, you know, it can see.

327
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,640
It can see you winding up a shot.

328
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Okay. It's going to predict where the shot is heading from.

329
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,640
And how's it doing that?

330
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:35,640
We're tracking the upper body angles

331
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
and using that to predict what shot.

332
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,640
We use multiple track points.

333
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,640
You can see you doing this.

334
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,640
Telegraphing a shot.

335
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,640
And it also understands what you're trying to trick.

336
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Like, good boxes, good boxes.

337
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,640
They strategize.

338
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:55,640
They would come up with one angle and then they struck it.

339
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640
It's trying to get another.

340
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
So, buy boxes.

341
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,640
You can also understand these things.

342
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,640
Center for different levels.

343
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,640
You can try it.

344
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,640
You can try it.

345
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,640
You know, dodge the shot.

346
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,640
But here, you know, you can, you can work on your,

347
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,640
you can work on your boxing technique,

348
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,640
but it's also an awesome upper body cardio workout technique.

349
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,640
We have different modes.

350
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
We have training modes.

351
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
You can work on your different punches.

352
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,640
We'll give you standard boxing combination.

353
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,640
Combination of jab is across the hooks.

354
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,640
And it'll build you a workout routine.

355
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,640
Awesome.

356
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,640
Yeah, thank you.

357
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,640
One of the product categories I was most excited about at CES

358
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,640
was health and fitness technology.

359
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,640
Here, we speak with Frank McGillan of Quell,

360
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,640
a wearable task with delivering chronic pain relief

361
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,640
using AI and neuro technology.

362
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,640
I'm here with Frank McGillan with Quell.

363
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,640
What's Quell doing?

364
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,640
So Quell is the first pain relief solution

365
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,640
to integrate neuro technology plus AI

366
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,640
to deliver personalized approach to treating chronic pain.

367
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,640
All right, so let's break that apart.

368
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
So neuro technology.

369
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,640
Neuro technology.

370
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Yeah, yeah.

371
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,640
What is the neuro technology aspect of the problem?

372
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,640
So neuro technology is stimulating sensory nerves

373
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,640
with high frequency, high power, electrical stimulation.

374
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,640
And it triggers the body's natural pain blocking mechanism.

375
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,640
Okay.

376
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,640
After first generation product in 2015,

377
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,640
and this year we brought AI to make this product even smarter

378
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,640
and react better to the patient's needs.

379
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,640
And so how specifically are you using AI?

380
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Yeah, well, we're tapped into.

381
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:30,640
We have 70,000 users from our first generation product

382
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:33,640
who volunteered their health profile information.

383
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
So we're able to look at everything from,

384
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,640
you know, where do they have pain?

385
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,640
How long have they had pain?

386
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
Other health conditions.

387
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,640
It's body mass, age, all those factors.

388
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,640
They were applied machine learning to that data,

389
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,640
to look at clusters,

390
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,640
to find similarities in clusters.

391
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,640
And we've built that into a smart algorithm

392
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,640
into the growl device.

393
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,640
So when a new user gets quell,

394
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,640
they're benefiting from all the learning we have

395
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,640
from those 70,000 people.

396
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,640
Okay.

397
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,640
So what's an example of something

398
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,640
that machine learning helps you do better?

399
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,640
Yeah.

400
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,640
So we found that, you know, certain phenotypes of pain sufferers

401
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,640
that are normal calibration may misjudge

402
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,640
what their dosage should be.

403
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,640
They say that their dose should be lower or higher,

404
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
for example, than what they really need.

405
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
And my dosage, we're talking about the amount of electrical

406
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
which is an elation.

407
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
Yeah, exactly.

408
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
Exactly.

409
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,640
So in the key to getting quality relief

410
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,640
is getting the dosage right.

411
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,640
You know, if you think about it,

412
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,640
if you're taking pain medication,

413
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,640
if you're taking 10 milligrams and you need 100,

414
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,640
you're not going to see relief.

415
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,640
Well, the same thing with neuro stimulation

416
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,640
or electrical therapy.

417
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,640
So based on our smart algorithm,

418
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:44,640
we're now actually factoring in, you know,

419
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,640
hundreds of variables in addition to this

420
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,640
nervous sensitivity test we do when you first use the product.

421
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
Okay, awesome.

422
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,640
And do you have, it looks like a band that you wear.

423
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,640
You don't happen to have one on your knee.

424
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,640
I actually do.

425
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,640
So, you know, it's born under your leg here.

426
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,640
Okay.

427
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,640
And it's controlled through the app.

428
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,640
So we have a swell app here which lets you

429
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,640
help you manage the device.

430
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,640
We provide a lot of tracking information.

431
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,640
So we're not only collecting some of this profile data,

432
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,640
but we're also collecting things like activity,

433
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
gate, sleep.

434
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
So we provide a lot of tracking information.

435
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,640
And again, we're using this data not only to make the device smarter,

436
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,640
but also helping improve in the real world

437
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
how to achieve recovery pain relief.

438
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,640
Okay. And are there other examples of where machine learning

439
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,640
AI have come into play beyond the calibration?

440
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,640
So that's our first step.

441
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Okay.

442
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
You know, we're really, again, trying to make sure we benefit

443
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,640
from all the data we've collected from our current users.

444
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,640
Yeah, what we're looking at for next step is how to apply that,

445
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,640
not only in that initial calibration,

446
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,640
but on an ongoing basis.

447
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
Okay.

448
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Awesome. Thanks so much, Frank.

449
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,640
Cool.

450
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Thank you.

451
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
Perhaps my least favorite category at CES

452
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,640
was so-called smart cities.

453
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,640
Not because they're not smart,

454
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,640
but rather because too often it's just a thinly veiled euphemism

455
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,640
for the surveillance state.

456
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,640
That said, my conversation with Zemanthus was interesting

457
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,640
because they claim to fix something that we all hate.

458
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,640
Traffic.

459
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,640
All right, cool. So I'm here with Alexandros from Zemanthus.

460
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,640
What is Zemanthus up to?

461
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,640
Zemanthus, we are predicting what will happen

462
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,640
in your traffic route before you get there.

463
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:30,640
So we can give you, for instance, information

464
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,640
about an upcoming traffic jam, 30 minutes or one hour

465
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
or two hours into the future.

466
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
And the beauty of it is, you can avoid it.

467
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
If you know it's going to happen.

468
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,640
Now, in order to do this,

469
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,640
you need some advanced mathematics.

470
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
And this is where Xemanthus came in.

471
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,640
We have a patented algorithm already

472
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,640
that combines machine learning and stochastic modeling

473
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,640
in order to produce this advanced forecasting

474
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,640
of your future routes to work or home.

475
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,640
So you can actually get there in time before anyone else.

476
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,640
But of course it's not just for just private users.

477
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:09,640
The municipality is gained because there is reduction in fuel.

478
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,640
There is reduction in congestion.

479
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,640
There is reduction in pollutants for the environment.

480
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,640
So everybody gains by avoiding a congestion, for instance.

481
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,640
So the idea is that you're combining statistical models

482
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,640
with more model-based approaches.

483
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,640
Exactly.

484
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,640
So machine learning is, as you know,

485
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,640
useful to predict patterns in the usual historic information.

486
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,640
So machine learning finds out what is usually going to happen

487
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,640
in traffic.

488
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,640
But to figure out what will happen in the future,

489
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,640
the patterns is not always very accurate

490
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,640
because traffic is chaotic phenomena.

491
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,640
So to figure out what happens in the future,

492
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,640
we use our own stochastic algorithms.

493
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:54,640
Which is like predicting what will happen in the stock market

494
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,640
together with the machine learning.

495
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
And those two, combined together,

496
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,640
allow us to have amazing accuracy for future events

497
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,640
before they occur.

498
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Okay. And so these are like your kind of jamming machine learning

499
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,640
models and like Markov processes,

500
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,640
MM1 cues and MMN cues and all that kind of stuff.

501
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,640
So it is Markov modeling together with Monte Carlo

502
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,640
for the simulations.

503
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
Exactly.

504
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,640
Okay. So primarily simulation-based.

505
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:21,640
Okay.

506
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Because once you simulate based on the real data,

507
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,640
what will happen, then you can start avoiding the problems.

508
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
Okay.

509
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
Because you know where they will occur.

510
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,640
In that location of the road in 30 minutes,

511
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,640
I'll have a traffic jam.

512
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,640
I know what to do now.

513
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
Okay.

514
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,640
You've got some of the use cases here

515
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,640
and you're also displaying some of the results you've seen.

516
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,640
This is an example in Sweden.

517
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,640
We got real data in blue versus green are predictions.

518
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,640
Which is right on top of each other.

519
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
Yeah.

520
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,640
And this is over several days we can do that.

521
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,640
Okay.

522
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,640
An amazing thing, which is really important,

523
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,640
is this graph in the bottom.

524
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:02,640
So down here, you have the usual traffic jam,

525
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,640
but then on the 23rd of November,

526
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,640
there is no traffic congestion.

527
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,640
Yet we predicted that.

528
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,640
They won't be any.

529
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,640
Okay.

530
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
You know what happened on the 23rd of November?

531
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,640
Looks like black Friday.

532
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
It's a black Friday.

533
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,640
Okay.

534
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,640
And you know why this is amazing?

535
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
If you go around,

536
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,640
any machine learning algorithm will predict the pattern.

537
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,640
Every, you know, five o'clock,

538
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
you have a traffic jam.

539
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,640
But they won't predict it's a black Friday.

540
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,640
We predicted it was a black Friday.

541
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,640
Not traffic jam.

542
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,640
It seems like it would depend on what kind of features

543
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,640
you're using, like if you're,

544
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,640
if your feature engineering kind of tags historical data

545
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
with, you know, events like back Friday

546
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,640
would do a better job of predicting it.

547
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,640
So what allowed your approach to do a better?

548
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,640
A stochastic pattern, the algorithm is what allows that.

549
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,640
Because it's not only looking at the patterns,

550
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,640
which are real cool,

551
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,640
but says what will happen in the future based

552
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,640
on the current information.

553
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,640
And then the stochastic algorithm takes over for the future.

554
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,640
And never, ever hit the congestion

555
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,640
because it was a black Friday.

556
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,640
I don't know how it happened.

557
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,640
Because I don't control the stochastic.

558
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,640
It's a market process.

559
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,640
It's a random thing.

560
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,640
You will do its own thing.

561
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,640
But the figure did it out on its own.

562
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,640
That's why we saw this.

563
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,640
It was an amazing result.

564
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,640
And so the data sources that you've played around with

565
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,640
are primarily traffic-based or there are others.

566
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,640
So we use whatever is provided.

567
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,640
In this case, we have cameras and video.

568
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,640
So we use that.

569
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,640
But we can use RFID to detect as you name it.

570
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,640
Whatever we are provided, we use it.

571
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,640
It can all go in as input in the algorithm.

572
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,640
It doesn't care.

573
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,640
And what was the origin of the technology?

574
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
The origin is my own because I'm a mathematician.

575
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,640
So I actually created my own stochastic model

576
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,640
because I work in traffic.

577
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
To simulate traffic.

578
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,640
And because it's a chaotic phenomenon,

579
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
it was research for me.

580
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,640
But I saw the obvious advantage here.

581
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,640
So I created a company.

582
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,640
Okay.

583
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,640
And so have you published on this at all?

584
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,640
Yes.

585
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,640
After we did the pattern, then we published it.

586
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,640
Okay. And where can we find that?

587
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,640
What's the name of the paper that folks should look at?

588
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,640
There are several papers now.

589
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,640
Okay.

590
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,640
I've been giving different conferences,

591
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,640
the information.

592
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,640
So I've published a number of papers by now.

593
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,640
Any particular one we can start out with?

594
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,640
Yeah.

595
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Asymmetric simple exclusion processes.

596
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,640
Asymmetric simple exclusion processes.

597
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,640
For traffic dynamics, yes.

598
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,640
Okay. Awesome.

599
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,640
Yeah.

600
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,640
Alexandra, thank you so much.

601
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,640
Autonomous vehicles come in all different shapes, sizes,

602
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,640
form factors at CES.

603
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,640
And one of the most impactful applications

604
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,640
targets people with limited mobility.

605
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,640
Check out this clip for a look at a computer vision equipped wheelchair

606
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,640
developed by HuBox Robotics,

607
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,640
a startup partnering with Intel.

608
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,640
You can see all my facial expressions

609
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,640
and all the data I can capture.

610
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,640
All the points.

611
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:04,640
So this is what is running inside the Intel Nug.

612
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:14,640
So in real time, you can capture facial expressions in a more precise way

613
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,640
than any other technology you do.

614
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,640
So which allows us to use the kids to stop the wheelchair,

615
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,640
open mouth to go to one side,

616
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,640
let me just turn them.

617
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,640
Turn them off.

618
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,640
Nice.

619
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,640
And a kids to stop.

620
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,640
Raise that eyebrow.

621
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,640
Kids to stop.

622
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,640
Open mouth.

623
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,640
And kids to stop.

624
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,640
And a quick smile.

625
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,640
And move forward.

626
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
And even a tongue out.

627
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,640
Sometimes I can hold back.

628
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,640
So you see the precision.

629
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,640
You see the quality of the capture and facial expressions

630
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,640
in the technology.

631
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,640
So this is what we are delivering to the market

632
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,640
using terrorism scammer and also the Intel Nug.

633
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,640
It's our own work computer that I have here

634
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,640
underneath the wheelchair.

635
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,640
So we are processing everything locally

636
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,640
to capture those facial expressions.

637
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,640
So far we can capture 10 facial expressions.

638
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,640
You can use five of them to control your wheelchair.

639
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:40,640
And the other ones you can talk to Alexa by Amazon for example.

640
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:51,640
So from AI perspective in this based on a supervised type of model

641
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,640
did you train it on?

642
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,640
It's already pre-trained.

643
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:00,640
So what we did was we create a huge data set of 3D faces

644
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,640
because we are using 3D technology.

645
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,640
We pre-trained it to classify 10 facial expressions.

646
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,640
I'll give you an example.

647
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,640
We are able to classify a full smile, a half smile,

648
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,640
and a shy smile for example.

649
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,640
So this is huge, right?

650
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,640
And using 3D technology we are able to do this

651
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,640
regardless of the light condition.

652
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,640
So what we did was we create two layers.

653
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:24,640
This is 2TAC, right?

654
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,640
But we create two layers.

655
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,640
One, using machine learning.

656
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,640
So we can classify those facial expressions.

657
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,640
And the second layer, we use some eristics.

658
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,640
So I have never met before, but if we smile right now,

659
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,640
I can tell that you are smiling, right?

660
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,640
So we just touched algorithm to get back there.

661
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,640
So we have two layers.

662
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,640
One machine learning.

663
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
And now we have our eristics.

664
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,640
So we start to optimize this technology

665
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,640
using the intention of open Vino.

666
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,640
So now we can open Vino.

667
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,640
So now we can have a deep learning layer.

668
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,640
So 3 layers, machine learning, eristics,

669
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,640
and also deep learning.

670
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,640
And we can do this all offline, all offline,

671
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,640
just using the knock here underneath the wheelchair.

672
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,640
So here I can perform some facial expressions.

673
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,640
Just turn on.

674
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
I can't remember the numbers.

675
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,640
I can't remember, however,

676
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
you know, the numbers are there.

677
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
They think like a background.

678
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
It's left on the ground.

679
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
A pretty smile to move forward.

680
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
It's right there.

681
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
I can't remember the numbers.

682
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,640
Raised eyebrow.

683
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
I can't remember.

684
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
And even a dongle.

685
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
I can't move backwards.

686
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
So they're just taking the...

687
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,640
Cool.

688
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Thank you.

689
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,640
