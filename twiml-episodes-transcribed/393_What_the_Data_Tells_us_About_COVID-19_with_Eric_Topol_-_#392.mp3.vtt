Welcome to the Twimal AI Podcast.

00:13.400 --> 00:18.200
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:18.200 --> 00:32.120
All right, everyone. I am pleased to be here with Eric Topol. Eric is Professor of Molecular

00:32.120 --> 00:37.680
Medicine at Scripps Research, as well as the Director and Founder of the Scripps Research

00:37.680 --> 00:41.920
Translational Institute. Eric, welcome to the Twimal AI Podcast.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.600
Thanks very much, Sam. Great to be with you.

00:44.600 --> 00:51.680
I am really excited to have you on the show. I've been a fan of your Twitter feed for

00:51.680 --> 00:58.760
quite some time. You have been one of the resources that I've tended to turn to to try to understand

00:58.760 --> 01:04.560
the COVID-19 and coronavirus situation as it's been evolving. So thank you very much for

01:04.560 --> 01:10.800
that. I'm really looking forward to digging into talking about your perspective on that.

01:10.800 --> 01:15.440
But before we do, I'd love to have you share a little bit about your background. You're

01:15.440 --> 01:22.240
trained as a cardiologist if I'm correct. I imagine that a lot of cardiologists have their

01:22.240 --> 01:28.280
time well full studying the heart, but you've managed to really dig into the role that technology

01:28.280 --> 01:34.440
plays in medicine and in particular, artificial intelligence. How did that all come about?

01:34.440 --> 01:41.160
Well, it's interesting how I got into this, Sam. Back in college, I was in genetics. The

01:41.160 --> 01:48.280
major, and I always loved that area, but I drifted to cardiology, got into the interventional

01:48.280 --> 01:53.440
that is putting its stems and balloons, arteries, and whatnot. But I mostly got back to the

01:53.440 --> 02:01.840
genetics in the mid-90s to try to understand why people had heart attacks or heart disease.

02:01.840 --> 02:10.560
And then, when I got to San Diego in 2006, I started up this new institute. I realized genetics

02:10.560 --> 02:15.680
wasn't going to do enough. We needed sensors and other layers of data to understand each

02:15.680 --> 02:22.840
person. And that led to the total kind of digital medicine, the interest. And then became pretty

02:22.840 --> 02:27.640
natural that if you have a genome and you have continuous sensor data, you need some advanced

02:27.640 --> 02:32.400
analytics to really understand what's going on. So that's kind of the progression how it

02:32.400 --> 02:40.600
all came to pass. That is understanding each person who is unique in every layer of biology,

02:40.600 --> 02:48.320
physiology, their environment, and anatomy. So this is kind of the story how it's unfolded.

02:48.320 --> 02:57.520
Great. So in terms of COVID-19 and coronavirus, at least as far as the work from home and

02:57.520 --> 03:03.560
quarantines and all that goes, many of us are recently passing a hundred days in for

03:03.560 --> 03:09.280
folks that have been studying it closely. We're quite a bit beyond that in terms of it's

03:09.280 --> 03:12.880
having been on the scene. Maybe we can start by having you share a little bit of your

03:12.880 --> 03:20.960
take on kind of where we are with our understanding of the disease and how that's evolved over

03:20.960 --> 03:27.520
the past few months. It's been amazing really how six months time we've learned quite a bit

03:27.520 --> 03:34.560
and still every day we learn more. So at first it was built as a respiratory virus. And then

03:34.560 --> 03:40.800
we learned that because it goes after the ACE2 receptor, it actually goes to many different

03:40.800 --> 03:48.320
organs, especially the heart, kidneys, and to some extent, pancreatic and brain liver. So it turned

03:48.320 --> 03:56.960
out that what was just a lung disease became complete body potential for this virus to have

03:56.960 --> 04:03.440
its impact. And so the other thing that kind of been shocking is the spectrum here that you can

04:03.440 --> 04:11.760
have people 30% or more who experience no symptoms whatsoever. And then you have 1% or less

04:11.760 --> 04:18.960
that it can be fatal. So it's quite a spectrum. And then you know people who are this without

04:18.960 --> 04:26.800
symptom group up to a half may even have internal damage or hurt that they don't even know about.

04:26.800 --> 04:34.720
So for example with lung CT scan in four different series we've seen this evidence of lung effects

04:34.720 --> 04:41.360
that they had no idea they had symptoms. So this is a really challenging virus. No wonder we

04:41.360 --> 04:50.960
have a global pandemic because it is unique. It's a stealth spread but it can be fatal. And the

04:50.960 --> 04:56.080
other thing I think that's becoming more evidence than the recent weeks is the cornicity issue.

04:56.640 --> 05:02.640
A lot of people don't get fully recovered can linger for a long time. That may be part of the

05:02.640 --> 05:09.840
immunologic reaction why people feel really washed out and you still have problems with breathing

05:09.840 --> 05:15.440
and other issues. And so we're just starting to learn about that and not of course discouraging too.

05:16.240 --> 05:24.960
Early on as the disease emerged and the scientific community and in particular the data science

05:24.960 --> 05:30.480
and machine learning community heard about this. You know lots of folks wanted to jump in and

05:30.480 --> 05:38.000
help understand this and people really struggle to make sense of data. I think my sense is that

05:38.000 --> 05:43.280
we're still struggling. There are still lots of different representations, lots of challenges

05:43.280 --> 05:49.760
with getting clean data but I'm curious your take on how data has impacted our understanding

05:49.760 --> 05:55.600
of the disease in particular and what we've learned in the past six months.

05:56.240 --> 06:00.720
Well we have learned in the United States does them have very good arms around their data

06:01.360 --> 06:07.200
and that's been a more challenging. So most countries where there's a national data

06:07.200 --> 06:15.440
dashboard we have nothing. The CDC basically didn't show up and there is this bootstrapping

06:15.440 --> 06:22.640
COVID-19 tracking project that was developed by the Atlantic and volunteers and that's actually

06:22.640 --> 06:29.760
collecting the data going to 56 different websites every day to try to call the number of people

06:29.760 --> 06:35.760
who are tested at the results and whatever they can get which is limited. So we don't know at any

06:35.760 --> 06:42.400
given moment how many people are in the ICU, how many ICU beds are available in hospitals and

06:42.400 --> 06:48.560
you know the demographics and so many things. We just have a sense that the people were affected,

06:48.560 --> 06:54.560
infected, have shifted to a younger group since the reopening started to begin but we're in a

06:54.560 --> 07:00.320
country that's leading the epicenter of this pandemic and it just shows you how we don't have

07:00.320 --> 07:07.120
the data, the input. You've got some real powerful output. Are you finding that are there any

07:07.120 --> 07:14.800
particular analyses that you've seen emerged that you're finding particularly helpful in understanding

07:14.800 --> 07:21.600
the epidemic? Well one of the most impressive things is that during this surge that started

07:21.600 --> 07:29.040
you know in mid-June in the US where we have this extraordinary steep slope of new cases. Now you know

07:29.040 --> 07:35.280
well 40,000 and even today during testimony Tony Fauci mentioned it could get up to 100,000

07:36.240 --> 07:43.280
but today we keep seeing a reduction in the death rate which is an incredible divergence

07:43.280 --> 07:50.400
that's poorly understood. That could just represent a significant lag. It also could represent

07:50.400 --> 07:56.720
that younger people are affected and they're now showing up in hospitals more and they may take

07:56.720 --> 08:02.000
time to see that or for that to reverberate in their own communities but because of not having

08:02.000 --> 08:07.760
data we're more hampered. We're compromised and understanding having an absolute analysis of

08:08.800 --> 08:15.920
at a macro level that's quite important. Yeah. You've also been involved in some of the efforts

08:15.920 --> 08:23.680
around contact tracing and wearables and other technological interventions to you know both

08:23.680 --> 08:29.520
understand and treat maybe you can give us a lay of the land of you know what's what's happening

08:29.520 --> 08:35.520
there. Starting with contact tracing and some of the the applications and implications.

08:35.520 --> 08:41.440
Yeah so it's interesting contact tracing is being used now in many countries but it hasn't

08:41.440 --> 08:50.160
been validated and so it requires a large portion of the people in that country or place to use it

08:50.160 --> 08:57.280
but also because it can generate false positives it could create lots of issues on privacy and

08:57.280 --> 09:04.800
confusion and so it's alluring from a clever technical standpoint of using smartphone

09:04.800 --> 09:11.280
chirps to help alert people and try to prevent spread and as you well know we don't have enough

09:11.280 --> 09:17.280
human contact tracing people so it could be a booster but it remained

09:17.920 --> 09:24.000
unvalidated and has privacy concerns. Well we've been working with this digital surveillance

09:24.000 --> 09:32.480
music smartwatches or fitness wristband and we have almost 40,000 people now in the US where we're

09:32.480 --> 09:39.600
getting their continuous heart rate physical activity and they have it on during sleep we have

09:39.600 --> 09:44.160
that both metrics and we already are seeing signals that we may be able to pick up

09:44.800 --> 09:51.520
the cluster of people so we have all 50 states covered and as we get more and more people in

09:51.520 --> 09:56.240
in hundreds of thousands and not millions we hopefully can stay ahead of the pandemic because

09:57.520 --> 10:04.640
you hear task task tests but you can't test 330 million people no less once one off but on

10:04.640 --> 10:12.160
our frequent basis so the digital continuous with recurrent neural network analytics to understand

10:12.160 --> 10:19.520
where and when there may be a burden cluster and then do guided testing and conflict tracing

10:20.320 --> 10:26.080
and isolation that we think could turn out to be a way to start to get some control of

10:26.080 --> 10:33.680
an unambated unbridled or increasing cases which is accompanied now by increase in hospitalizations

10:33.680 --> 10:40.160
in the state where this has been chiefly occurring. So this system that you're working on it's

10:41.120 --> 10:47.600
not about contact tracing but about identifying the disease and individuals preemptively based

10:47.600 --> 10:52.240
on different signals you're able to pick up from the smartwatches and fitness meters.

10:52.240 --> 10:57.520
Right we have done that work with flu a flu like I almost published in

10:57.520 --> 11:06.640
earlier this year that we could pick up flu throughout five states exclusively well better than

11:06.640 --> 11:14.880
other CDC methods of today earlier and as accurate. So the hope is that we can use that but there

11:14.880 --> 11:21.680
are other alternatives for there's some akinza smart thermometer that's out there in more

11:21.680 --> 11:27.120
than a million Americans that take their temperature each day at least one and that's been helpful

11:27.120 --> 11:33.360
to localize the tensile cluster there's also you know things like the URA rain which has got

11:34.160 --> 11:40.560
lots of metrics that it captures through the rain chips inside the interlining so

11:41.360 --> 11:46.560
orthogonal data from many sources could be helpful but the reason why we picked the smartwatches

11:46.560 --> 11:53.120
we had published data and because a hundred million people in the US already have a fitness

11:53.120 --> 12:00.080
band or a smartwatch so it's passive and we could get a large number quickly and of course

12:00.080 --> 12:08.160
they relies on AI analytics to help localize where there is a potential issue it's not good at

12:08.160 --> 12:15.200
individual level it's really only useful to look at a special temporal geographic type

12:15.200 --> 12:22.640
caution okay when you say it's not good at an at an individual level meaning are you trying to

12:22.640 --> 12:30.240
identify the individuals that may have the disease based on the the data that you're collecting

12:30.960 --> 12:36.080
and what way if if you are doing that and what ways that not useful for the individuals it just

12:36.080 --> 12:42.640
not accurate enough to a signal for that individual to go do take action yeah exactly so let's

12:42.640 --> 12:47.600
say Sam you had an increased rest in heart rate which is the chief metric and it went out from

12:47.600 --> 12:57.120
your normal just from 60 to 70 okay and your step decrease and your sleep increase those would

12:57.120 --> 13:04.560
all be the three parameters that might forget you had 2019 but on an individual singlet on it

13:04.560 --> 13:09.760
we you know you could have many others but if I found out that all your neighbors all your

13:09.760 --> 13:17.040
networks were showing similar signs I'd say that's a signal so it's just not sharp enough I'd

13:17.040 --> 13:23.120
add a one to you choosing you got a pretty coarse metrics to to look at for an individual

13:23.520 --> 13:29.440
exactly or some of the are there you know technologies out there and some of these smartwatches

13:29.440 --> 13:34.800
that you know can give you more granularity in terms of you know temperature I you know what would

13:34.800 --> 13:41.360
you what would you wish you had access to to make it more useful for an individual well if we got

13:41.360 --> 13:48.080
both body temperature accurately and oximetry the oxygen saturation of the body which now

13:48.080 --> 13:55.200
the smartwatches have or are can activity we we could probably start getting more granular and

13:55.200 --> 14:01.280
and get signals that would be useful potentially at an individual level but a lot of people never

14:01.280 --> 14:09.200
have fever at least half or not more and oximetry the oxygen saturation you know that's not

14:09.200 --> 14:16.960
going to drop down until the disease or the infection is further along but what's interesting

14:16.960 --> 14:24.240
you bring up here is that because the asymptomatic carrier rate is high 30% or we think that

14:24.240 --> 14:30.880
third people will have defines will have the higher heart rate because we know some of them have internal

14:30.880 --> 14:37.280
hits or by ordinance at least the lungs so we think we'll be able to pick those up and that's

14:37.280 --> 14:42.080
going to be important because otherwise these people would never know that they had an infection

14:42.640 --> 14:49.680
yeah they were I think that the stats early on we're saying that or the stories early on we're

14:49.680 --> 14:56.320
talking about folks we're losing I forget the specific percentage of lung capacity long term

14:56.320 --> 15:02.480
even post disease and I think I always took that to be you know those folks that were you know

15:02.480 --> 15:07.920
seriously affected and ended up on respiratory you know ventilators and the like

15:08.800 --> 15:14.240
is what you're saying that you know even the asymptomatic folks will have that kind of

15:14.240 --> 15:20.400
long-term effect do we know kind of the magnitude of potential long-term effects or the range of

15:20.400 --> 15:26.320
long-term effects for the you know this huge population of asymptomatic folks yeah we don't know

15:26.320 --> 15:32.960
unfortunately because we only had those four series they did the CAT scans of the lungs they

15:32.960 --> 15:39.680
didn't repeat any CAT scans we do know that their lung abnormalities were similar to those who had

15:39.680 --> 15:45.520
symptoms and we don't even have enough follow-up on the people with symptoms to know how soon

15:45.520 --> 15:52.560
that that resolved most likely it resolves in most people but there may be some group we don't

15:52.560 --> 16:00.160
know how frequent where it becomes an enduring issue and there isn't complete resolution and that

16:00.160 --> 16:09.040
may be partly mediated by the immune response that it just is not either sufficient or hyperactive

16:09.040 --> 16:14.800
you know there's many different kind of responses here it's the way people handle this virus is

16:14.800 --> 16:25.040
so heterogeneous yeah yeah in your book you talk quite a bit about deep phenotyping kind of this

16:25.040 --> 16:30.720
really deep understanding of the individual on you know lots of different levels

16:30.720 --> 16:40.080
you know how far have we gone with kind of trying to you know correlate some of that phenotyping data

16:40.080 --> 16:46.320
to information about COVID to understand you know what might make someone the asymptomatic

16:46.320 --> 16:54.080
having asymptomatic response versus what makes someone likely to you know have a more serious

16:54.080 --> 16:59.520
response yeah that's a great question because is it just viral load or does some of that come from

16:59.520 --> 17:05.200
the phenotype of the individual yeah it does come from the phenotype as well there's been now

17:05.840 --> 17:13.280
several genomic studies getting back to my grounding when I the air add particularly

17:13.280 --> 17:18.400
like to work in but there's been the so-called genome-wide association studies where you don't

17:18.400 --> 17:24.000
consume anything you just let the genome talk and there's been two of those and they both

17:24.000 --> 17:31.600
found that the blood type ABL blood type that the A type is got some intrigues risk perhaps 20 or

17:31.600 --> 17:38.640
30 percent whereas all blood type has protective effects and there's also a locust on chromosome 3

17:38.640 --> 17:46.080
which is many different immune receptor genes that lights up it's even that's even more prominent

17:46.080 --> 17:54.240
so there are some genomic aspects of each of that that modulate our response there's immune

17:54.240 --> 18:00.000
aspects that are tied to that but also in addition to that that are starting to show up we have

18:00.000 --> 18:07.840
seen like for example there's a very rare syndrome in kids like Kawasaki's disease that is a tie to

18:07.840 --> 18:15.200
the at least some of the kids have an immune system abnormality because 70 some of

18:15.200 --> 18:21.200
some of these people of the kids that get this are actually very healthy they never had any preexisting

18:21.200 --> 18:29.040
condition but there's something the glitch in their immune response whereas a hyper immune response

18:29.040 --> 18:34.160
that a couple of weeks after an infection leads to their rare condition of multi-system and

18:34.160 --> 18:42.160
inflammatory syndrome so-called MIS-C and this is a significant can be fatal in two to four

18:42.160 --> 18:48.560
percent of children even though it's very rare so there's a continuum here and it is not just the

18:48.560 --> 18:57.360
virus not just the setting but also the host the the individual you think about kind of where we've

18:58.000 --> 19:04.640
come over the past six months and the the role that artificial intelligence could play

19:05.680 --> 19:10.960
you know what are some of the things that you know you'd love to see or you know will expect

19:10.960 --> 19:17.680
to see or think that um you know are missing in the way we've applied AI to to this particular

19:17.680 --> 19:25.280
situation well we touched on one which is better detection before an outbreak really gets legs

19:26.000 --> 19:31.520
and now I think we will be able to get to that it's already getting to be the case in Germany

19:31.520 --> 19:36.000
and in China we're behind my we're behind everything here but hopefully we'll get there

19:36.000 --> 19:43.120
another important application Sam is can people who are presenting to an emergency room

19:43.120 --> 19:49.440
or telemedicine at their sick and then confirmed that they have an infection and should we

19:49.440 --> 19:54.800
admit them to the hospital or let them stay home and I think we're going to see algorithms that

19:54.800 --> 20:00.720
will help guide that because we want to keep people out of the hospital so they can stay in the

20:00.720 --> 20:07.680
convenience their home with their family loved ones and also the expense of the hospital and hospitals

20:07.680 --> 20:12.960
in some areas are already maximizing capacity so I think AI is going to help that we've got to get

20:12.960 --> 20:20.240
validated algorithms to prove it yeah uh the other area that I think that's got lots of potential

20:20.240 --> 20:27.680
is to support clinicians so that for example right now um there's some difficult choices like

20:27.680 --> 20:38.400
should you use a blood pen should you put a patient on a ventilator and if we can get all the data

20:38.400 --> 20:46.640
of not the individual but also as new data comes in from literature all a process we can help

20:46.640 --> 20:53.520
clinicians to make better decisions more accurate interpretations of the overwhelming data that

20:53.520 --> 21:02.880
they're doing. One of the conversations in the book that I thought was most interesting was

21:03.520 --> 21:09.600
and when you started to you were kind of bringing in this concept of system one and system two

21:09.600 --> 21:16.480
thinking and how you were just talking about you know what happens when a patient presents in a

21:16.480 --> 21:23.840
hospital uh how a lot of the success of medicine if you can put it like that is based on kind of

21:23.840 --> 21:29.680
system one immediate responses and how a lot of medical training is honing that you know system one

21:29.680 --> 21:40.320
response uh and you know there's a clear parallel between that system one thinking and uh what

21:40.320 --> 21:44.560
machine learning is currently good at what deep learning is currently good at Andrew Wang says

21:44.560 --> 21:50.480
you know machine learning is best for anything that a computer can do or that a human can do and

21:50.480 --> 21:58.320
less than a second kind of these snap uh judgment and responses um yeah I was wondering if you

21:58.320 --> 22:04.000
can elaborate a little bit on um you know this whole idea of system one and system two and the

22:04.000 --> 22:09.680
interplay with AI yeah I know it's really important and fundamental actually I hear because

22:09.680 --> 22:18.480
doctors make a lot of mistakes by reflexive thinking instead of reflective system two thing

22:19.280 --> 22:25.760
uh Danny Connerman kind of nailed it in terms of that our brain makes reflex

22:25.760 --> 22:30.560
judgments and decisions and in medicine that may not be good for person health

22:31.360 --> 22:38.080
in fact it leads to a lot of diagnostic inaccuracy whereas if we had the machine support

22:38.080 --> 22:45.280
then it would be more time to switch in to reflective system two thinking and get more

22:45.280 --> 22:51.120
accurate so you have both a combined effect of the machine processing data for that person

22:52.160 --> 23:00.560
but also the gift of time to think which is not enough of in medicine today that's the ultimate

23:00.560 --> 23:06.960
gift that AI can bring to medicine is the gift of time. There was some data points that you presented

23:06.960 --> 23:15.200
that's if I interpreted them correctly seem to be suggesting that when doctors actually do think

23:15.200 --> 23:23.040
they're uh the accuracy of their diagnoses decreases that seem to suggest that you know that when

23:23.040 --> 23:28.720
they you know hone their kind of reflexive you know thinking and kind of make these immediate

23:29.680 --> 23:36.000
judgments that they they tended to make better diagnoses am I interpreting that you know those

23:36.000 --> 23:41.600
data points correctly and and how does you know how do we kind of integrate that with you know

23:41.600 --> 23:46.880
giving doctors more time to to think about um you know what they're seeing. Well I think that's

23:46.880 --> 23:54.320
a little off Sam I think that what the data showed for example if as a doctor I keep if I think

23:54.320 --> 24:02.720
of the diagnosis in the first five minutes in working with a patient I think of it on a list

24:02.720 --> 24:08.720
then the accuracy is pretty good but if it doesn't come to mind the accuracy dropped off from

24:08.720 --> 24:15.520
you know whatever 90 plus percent to 20 some percent and so the point thing is humans are biased

24:15.520 --> 24:22.480
and so are of course all conditions of caring for patients and we have 180 different types of

24:22.480 --> 24:32.480
bias yep and so that bias it's in the way of that reflexive thinking and so when you have support from

24:32.480 --> 24:39.920
validated algorithms that can you know handle this data and you can provide that oversight for

24:39.920 --> 24:45.600
example in that example that example I just gave you might not have included in your mental

24:45.600 --> 24:52.160
list the diagnosis the patient actually had is you just didn't come to mind but you got prompted

24:52.960 --> 24:58.960
because the algorithm suggested that there's a probability of whatever 20 x percent

24:58.960 --> 25:03.920
this dialogue should be considered and then now you're thinking about that it never was in your

25:03.920 --> 25:12.560
mind so that's uh I think availability bias and I think that's this one example of many whereby

25:12.560 --> 25:21.920
you seem support and a human oversight is the best combination. You're thinking about medicine

25:21.920 --> 25:30.000
you know more broadly you know where what are you excited about seeing in terms of AI since you've

25:30.000 --> 25:36.000
you know started researching this and wrote the book. Well there's kind of a short term and a

25:36.000 --> 25:45.440
longer term expectation short term the accuracy of image interpretation should go way up I mean

25:45.440 --> 25:53.760
it really has all the potential and we'll see it not just in radiology dermatology pathology all

25:53.760 --> 25:59.360
aspects of medicine cardiology and what's interesting is that the mode for the randomized trials

25:59.360 --> 26:05.840
have been a gastroenterology to pick up pilots randomized throughout six of them and ophthalmology

26:05.840 --> 26:13.120
is leading the charge in terms of every potential serious eye condition to be better diagnosed with

26:14.160 --> 26:20.480
support through deep neural networks so that's the short term and I'll add in that short term

26:20.480 --> 26:28.720
getting rid of keyboard in the doctor's office then it depends on that is using the voice and

26:28.720 --> 26:35.680
synthetic notes instead of having to lose that intimate eye contact it's vital for the human

26:35.680 --> 26:42.320
connection and that's a segue to the longer term which is restoring the medical

26:43.120 --> 26:49.680
intimate relationship with trust the human connection between patients and their doctors and

26:49.680 --> 26:57.120
nurses and that's where I think we have this unparalleled opportunity if we work on it and the

26:57.120 --> 27:06.640
premise there is that you know by you know shifting from a keyboard oriented interaction to

27:06.640 --> 27:13.680
voice the doctor can be more present with the patient and establish that trust or do you see a

27:13.680 --> 27:20.320
more direct role for AI in that establishing that trust relationship well you certainly brought

27:20.320 --> 27:27.600
up one key way which is the ability to actually talk to patients be with them have a presence

27:28.800 --> 27:35.520
but we also review the fact that it's impossible for any person now any doctor or nurse clinician

27:35.520 --> 27:43.600
to review all that data and you know use instead of that time where it would detract from the patient

27:43.600 --> 27:51.120
interaction that would be processed and crystallized for that condition but the other part that we

27:51.120 --> 27:59.120
haven't brought up really is the patient economy so most of the common diagnoses like a skin

27:59.120 --> 28:05.040
rash or a lesion an ear infection in the child a urinary tract infection heart rhythm

28:05.040 --> 28:13.360
abnormalities both on and on AI tool will give patient a doctorless diagnostic capability they've

28:13.360 --> 28:19.920
never had before we've already started seeing that so we can shift the interaction between

28:19.920 --> 28:25.760
doctors and patients the more important matters like the treatment for that condition that

28:25.760 --> 28:33.280
was diagnosed by them or things that are of important nature like a new diagnosis of cancer

28:33.280 --> 28:39.360
neurodegenerative disease or heart disease something like that so the whole idea is that we can

28:39.360 --> 28:48.320
use this foundation of analytic to restore the immunity in those machines keep getting smarter

28:48.320 --> 28:54.960
hopefully humans can get more human. We first started seeing a lot of the successes around

28:55.760 --> 29:08.080
machine assisted or machine identification of things in medical imagery a lot of the media

29:08.080 --> 29:16.960
and conversations were around AI replacing radiologists and the like I think in I hope and you

29:16.960 --> 29:23.920
know the community of this podcast where beyond that but do you feel like as a broader community

29:23.920 --> 29:29.600
you know we're beyond that are we still you know struggling with this kind of either or

29:29.600 --> 29:36.080
relationship between physicians and AI and technology in general really great question

29:36.080 --> 29:43.280
the problem is that we're still in the mindset like when Gary Pesborough played big blue

29:43.280 --> 29:50.560
and chess and we're still there almost all the papers that come out comparing the algorithmic

29:51.120 --> 30:00.320
versus the doctor rather than the deep neural network data versus the combination of that and

30:00.320 --> 30:08.240
stuff so whether it's radiologic images or pathology specimens or whatever it is God Sam we don't

30:08.240 --> 30:13.200
we're not in the mode generally there's been a few papers that looked at that but most of them are

30:13.200 --> 30:19.840
painting machines versus man which is the wrong that's not wait it's going to go all night

30:19.840 --> 30:28.000
in the future so we're still stuck in that mode of the classic I guess competition and it's

30:28.000 --> 30:33.760
silly eventually we'll get beyond that but though there's very limited studies that have really

30:33.760 --> 30:40.400
looked at the way it stimulates how medicine will ultimately be practiced when we're at full

30:40.400 --> 30:46.320
machine support yeah there was one that comes to mind out of one of the medical centers in Boston

30:46.320 --> 30:54.000
I believe they were looking at breast cancer imagery and this was you know three four years ago

30:54.000 --> 31:01.600
I was one of the first ones that looked at doctor versus you know algorithm versus doctor plus

31:01.600 --> 31:07.040
algorithm and it was you know their result was clear that the doctor you know and the algorithm

31:07.040 --> 31:14.080
performed much better than either alone has you've said that you know there haven't been enough

31:14.080 --> 31:18.880
studies there but has that have we seen any replication of that across different you know

31:18.880 --> 31:25.120
types of images and diseases yes the problem is most of the studies that have been done now hundreds

31:25.120 --> 31:30.800
of them are retrospective okay so what they're doing they're just going back and they have pristine

31:30.800 --> 31:37.200
data set and then they're testing their and validating their algorithm and saying well look this

31:37.200 --> 31:44.400
works as well or better often claiming superior performance the only way to really do it right

31:44.400 --> 31:50.560
as you're getting to which is showing that the combination is better than machine long or the

31:50.560 --> 31:58.000
doctoral is a prospective study and there are some of those perhaps you know more than 10 now

31:58.000 --> 32:04.640
approaching 20 but those are much fewer and far between that they're just we need more of those

32:04.640 --> 32:09.920
just like we need more randomized trials and it's all the way is it just a matter of time or is it

32:09.920 --> 32:16.320
uh the cost and you know complexity or other factors associated with these prospective studies

32:16.320 --> 32:23.680
well the convenience is that there's these large annotated data set what it's shifted for AIDS

32:23.680 --> 32:29.040
or cardiograms or mammograms as you mentioned and they and skin regions they just get used

32:29.040 --> 32:34.960
over and over again whereas to do it right you've got to have developed your own new large

32:34.960 --> 32:41.760
annotated data sets and that is what the challenge is that you as you touch on its expense it takes time

32:41.760 --> 32:48.240
it has been done uh but you know I think we need more of that uh that'll help with you

32:48.240 --> 32:56.320
mm-hmm are there any particular studies that you are currently tracking that you know seem you

32:56.320 --> 33:00.720
know interesting and promising well we're just about to start one where we think it's exciting

33:00.720 --> 33:07.680
about diabetes okay believe it or not if you're a diabetic now the only algorithm you have to

33:07.680 --> 33:16.400
support you is your glucose is going up or down if you have a glucose sensor which is pretty

33:16.400 --> 33:24.080
incredible it's 2020 I think and that's the best we can do right so we're working on a multi-dimensional

33:24.080 --> 33:31.520
prospective study and a thousand people with type 2 diabetes with a glucose sensor taking pictures

33:31.520 --> 33:37.520
of everything they eat and drink getting their gut microbiome their genome their physical activity

33:37.520 --> 33:42.640
their sleep their stress you know everything you can think of and developing an algorithm to help

33:42.640 --> 33:51.360
them manage based on their data their glucose regulation and we know that certain foods have a

33:51.360 --> 34:00.000
completely disparate response and on an individual basis so we hope that we can do is provide each

34:00.000 --> 34:08.480
person in the future as this ideally is validated and expanded much better than your glucose is

34:08.480 --> 34:13.680
going up or down yeah I mean it's just it's just incredible and that's just kind of where the field

34:13.680 --> 34:21.360
is right now we're we're at a primitive state where we have so much vast potential in front of us

34:21.360 --> 34:29.200
yeah you your example kind of points out this idea of personalized medicine that has been I

34:29.200 --> 34:38.320
think that probably grew out of the the work in genomics 10 20 years ago and I'm curious your

34:38.320 --> 34:44.480
assessment of how close we've gotten to that or you know where we've we've had success with that

34:44.480 --> 34:49.520
it certainly doesn't seem from my perspective as a layperson and a consumer of medicine that

34:50.080 --> 34:55.440
when I'm going to the doctor my experience is particularly personalized based on you know genome

34:55.440 --> 35:00.640
and and all these things in spite of the fact that a lot of the things that we said we would need

35:00.640 --> 35:07.280
in order to get there the the cost and time of doing a whole sequence on an individual you know

35:07.280 --> 35:12.320
we've achieved a lot of those milestones you know what you what and where are we and what's

35:12.320 --> 35:19.200
lacking yeah well it's funny you mentioned that because last Friday during 26 with the 20th

35:19.200 --> 35:26.320
anniversary of the human the genome sequence graph you know the White House the whole fanfare

35:27.040 --> 35:31.920
and those 20 years has been remarkable progress but not in the things that you're getting at which

35:31.920 --> 35:40.000
is rare doesn't is unknown to these is in cancer that is the sequence helping to guide therapies

35:40.000 --> 35:46.800
many patients in people in women who are pregnant to help guide whether they made the harboring

35:46.800 --> 35:52.240
serious chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus without having to go through amniocentesis

35:52.240 --> 36:01.280
there's been select major transformative progress but it hasn't been made and as you said the

36:01.280 --> 36:08.000
sequence can be done for thousand dollars which is still expensive but compared to a lot of other

36:08.000 --> 36:14.800
tests we do in medicine like cat scans in MRI it's not that crazy but it isn't accepted by the

36:14.800 --> 36:20.000
medical community yet there's still lots of resistance and unfortunately that is holding us back

36:20.000 --> 36:26.960
and also we don't interpret the genome adequately because we need hundreds of millions if not

36:26.960 --> 36:33.840
billions to be able to get the most extract the most information from a genome for that person

36:33.840 --> 36:40.880
so we're still on that kind of early stage we're only limited health systems have started to

36:40.880 --> 36:47.120
implement it like geising or in Pennsylvania but most places are not using dynamics on a

36:47.120 --> 36:52.880
wide scale basis yet they're holding back part of it's been the cost and the reimbursement

36:52.880 --> 36:58.720
of lack of education of clinicians and a bunch of other factors but eventually I think we'll get

36:58.720 --> 37:05.200
there but I have to agree with you that a 20 years post genome sequence in some respects it's

37:05.200 --> 37:11.840
been disappointing when you say millions or billions you know we'll need millions or billions

37:11.840 --> 37:18.800
what are you referring to samples or something else yes if we had millions of people

37:18.800 --> 37:27.200
sent to people sequence and then with their phenotype that would follow because your phenotype

37:27.200 --> 37:31.760
today may change you may have a heart attack or you may have a new diagnosis of whatever

37:32.560 --> 37:40.640
so if we want to have all that data things like your response to medication and all sorts of things

37:41.200 --> 37:46.960
if we had a common data set with that large number of genome with the accompanying

37:46.960 --> 37:52.640
technical information then it becomes more valuable then it gets to mind a dream state or fantasy

37:52.640 --> 38:01.760
thing of the planetary health system where you have a digital twin infrastructure so let's say you

38:01.760 --> 38:10.400
got sick Sam and I can take your data put it into the resource find it six twin of your that

38:10.400 --> 38:15.600
match on every possible way which way and nearest neighbor analysis and then I get

38:15.600 --> 38:21.440
saying hmm this is your best treatment is your best outcomes or I can say here's how we prevent

38:21.440 --> 38:27.280
the condition but we are a long ways from that we can't even get the resource really built

38:27.280 --> 38:33.680
uh no less all the countries to work together to develop this planetary learning health system

38:33.680 --> 38:40.080
but theoretically possible and we are seeing it starting in areas in specific areas like cancer

38:40.080 --> 38:46.400
hopefully we'll see it much more in general in the future yeah that brings some on you know as

38:46.400 --> 38:52.400
did our conversation about contact tracing earlier on you know issues around privacy and others

38:52.400 --> 39:02.240
that you need to be accounted for in you know realizing visions like like yours anything interesting

39:02.240 --> 39:09.040
happening in that space yeah it's funny you have to love that too um kypholini and I

39:09.040 --> 39:14.960
published a paper on this nature biotent it takes the planet and basically we wouldn't

39:14.960 --> 39:19.440
believe in and talk about this this planetary health system or this you know massive information

39:19.440 --> 39:27.840
ignored without iterating AI so the data never left the place and basically you know the algorithm

39:27.840 --> 39:35.760
can't do the data to preserve the privacy and security and homomorphic encryption so the new tools

39:35.760 --> 39:43.040
are now available that weren't necessarily refined to more recently that are going to help

39:43.040 --> 39:52.000
achieve this ideal of privacy protecting privacy uh and uh having the data in such a state that

39:52.640 --> 39:58.560
the chances of having like we have today uh breaches and hacks and all sorts of

39:58.560 --> 40:05.680
of course nature of uh important precious data that we can avoid that so that's the whole that

40:05.680 --> 40:11.280
will employ these new methods that are actually pretty exciting because without them these idea

40:11.280 --> 40:17.680
would be ill-conceived great great all right thanks so much for taking the time to chat with us

40:17.680 --> 40:25.440
and share a bit about your perspective on uh the field and the pandemic any parting thoughts

40:25.440 --> 40:30.800
or words for our audience no i really enjoyed the conversations and we've had so many great

40:30.800 --> 40:38.400
questions and hopefully that listeners will get some ideas about where the field can go

40:38.400 --> 40:45.440
because it really is exciting uh and it could be the most important impact on medicine going

40:45.440 --> 40:51.280
forward the likes of which we've not ever seen before it may not be seen for generations

40:51.280 --> 41:01.600
