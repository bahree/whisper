00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,880
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,120
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:27,680
This week on the podcast features a series of conversations with speakers from the AI

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,520
Summit in New York City.

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,800
The theme of that conference and this series is AI in the Enterprise, and I think you'll

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,640
find a really interesting mix of both technical and case study oriented discussions this week.

8
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,000
Please note that on Wednesday, December 13th, we'll be holding our last Twimble online

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,960
meet-up of the year.

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,120
Bring your thoughts on the top machine learning and AI stories of 2017 for our discussion segment,

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,440
and for our main presentation, Bruno Gonzales will be discussing the paper, understanding

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,600
deep learning requires rethinking generalization by Shi Yuan Zhang from MIT and Google Brain

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,920
and others.

15
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,440
Today, I'm joined by Brian Gross, head of digital innovation for the Mexico City-based

16
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,240
airline Aero Mexico.

17
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,040
Aero Mexico is using AI techniques like neural nets to build a chatbot that responds to

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,160
its customers inquiries.

19
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,920
In our conversation, Brian describes how he views the chatbot landscape, shares his

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,360
thoughts on the platform requirements that establish enterprises like Aero Mexico have

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:39,800
for their bots, and describes how Aero Mexico plans to stay ahead of the curve.

22
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,680
Be sure to post any feedback or questions you may have to the show notes page, which

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,720
And now on to the show.

34
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:49,320
All right, everyone, I am here on the line with Brian Gross, who is Vice President of

35
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,240
Digital Innovation at Aero Mexico.

36
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,840
Brian, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

37
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,480
Hey, thanks for inviting me to your podcast.

38
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,480
Absolutely.

39
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,240
I'm looking forward to chatting with you about what you're doing at Aero Mexico with AI.

40
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,160
Why don't we get started by having you tell us a little bit about your background, how

41
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,320
you got interested in artificial intelligence, and how you're using it at Aero Mexico?

42
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,400
Yeah, so my background has always been in delivery channels, even before the internet.

43
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,360
So back in banking, we had electronic banking, then we did the studies for internet banking.

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,600
So we're talking the late 90s here, giving away my age a little bit, but at delivering

45
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,160
services over the web, right, with that was starting.

46
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:38,440
Then I was at AT&T back in the 2010 around then, doing consumer cloud services.

47
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,480
So we were developing more things like music storage and photo storage in the cloud.

48
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,800
And those products, well, honestly, it didn't really take off, but it was an interesting

49
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,400
exploration of the cloud right at the beginning there.

50
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,200
And then about four years ago, through various contacts, I came to do a consulting study here

51
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,200
at Aero Mexico in Mexico City.

52
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,200
I am.

53
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,320
So I am from the United States, but I've been down here in Mexico City for four years.

54
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,480
And it's a very interesting company.

55
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,040
It was stayed on for almost three decades.

56
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,200
And there was a lot of interest in modernizing the company on all fronts.

57
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,080
So they had a bunch of new blood come in in 2013, 2014.

58
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,240
And I came here and did an analysis of what needed to be done.

59
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,960
So from there, we did, they asked me to stay on and do a complete digital transformation.

60
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,720
So we did a new website, new app, new key asking all of that was had an API underlying

61
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
it.

62
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,320
So all the business logic of the airline, like flights, prices, check in and stuff like

63
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,320
that.

64
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,920
So the first time uniform across all these different delivery channels, whereas previously

65
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,920
they were they were separate black boxes.

66
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:52,680
So this is a huge impact and you're talking about an environment which is very far behind

67
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,840
a place like the United States or Western Europe in terms of digitalization, you know, people

68
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,680
purchasing their tickets online.

69
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,760
So we went from about one quarter of, let's say that we call that the penetration rate.

70
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,720
So how many people buy their tickets on our direct website went from about one quarter

71
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,960
what you would typically see in the US to about, now we're about one half of that of

72
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
that index.

73
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,320
So we've made tremendous progress over those years.

74
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:23,040
And then once that set of products was mature back in the beginning of 2017, my boss asked

75
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:28,120
me to start an innovation area and said, look, you know, the definition is completely open.

76
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,960
So we have a bunch of initiatives in parallel, but one of the ones that we started focusing

77
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,360
on was messaging platforms.

78
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,160
So Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, which is really big, you know, most parts of the world outside

79
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,160
the US.

80
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,880
Yeah, but I mean here in Mexico, WhatsApp is absolutely everything you use it to talk

81
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,120
to your friends, your family, professionals, whatever you're constantly on, on WhatsApp,

82
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,000
Facebook Messenger is also there.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,800
And these platforms were starting to open up for, you know, more famously chatbots, but

84
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,840
I think more broadly and more importantly, delivering customer service and to some extent

85
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,640
it sails, you know, over those channels.

86
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,160
So we really started focusing on that, and that's the origin of the presentation, the

87
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,080
story that I'm going to share.

88
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,000
And you mentioned the presentation this week connected around a presentation that you're

89
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,240
going to be doing at the AI summit.

90
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:26,440
I'm curious when you think about chatbots and using them for customer service, are there

91
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,720
any companies that you think, who's your role model in this space?

92
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,360
Who's doing it really, really well?

93
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,640
Well, I think all of this is really, really new.

94
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,560
I mean, Facebook only came out with the chatbot platform for Messenger back in April of

95
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,280
2016.

96
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,160
So people are so exploring.

97
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,600
There is no real best practice.

98
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,960
If we look, we're lucky, though, because in the airline world, there is KLM out there

99
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,400
who's very innovative on many different things, and this is one of them.

100
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,080
So they were the first ones to come out with an airline chatbot.

101
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,840
So we kind of looked at what was going on with them.

102
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,880
But if you look at the vendor space, it's still a real niche match.

103
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,480
You have some of the big players like IBM, with Watson, and so forth.

104
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,080
You have a lot now of the big digital agencies and consulting companies that will tell you

105
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,760
that they can deliver this, but there's no mature robust model.

106
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,560
I mean, we have ours, and we're really happy with what we've developed.

107
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,960
But we're working with a local startup here in Mexico City called Yellow Chat, and they're

108
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,960
just really brilliant.

109
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,880
So I think together we've developed an ecosystem around messaging that includes AI that's

110
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,120
really set to do amazing things in customer service.

111
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:40,520
When you think about this ecosystem and AI, what are the other things that you're doing

112
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:48,800
beyond the chatbot that you put in the AI bucket, or to what extent are you, well, I guess

113
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,600
I don't want to throw in too many questions at once.

114
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,880
Why don't we start with the full breadth of what you're doing under the AI banner?

115
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,880
Yeah.

116
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
Exactly.

117
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
Good question.

118
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,360
So talking about this ecosystem or platform around messaging, there's maybe half a dozen

119
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,080
elements to that, and the chatbot is really only one, because after all, chat has existed

120
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:14,080
for, I don't know how long, probably a decade or longer, right, on, there's web chat.

121
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,960
We have on our site still, we have this web-based chat that is just, it's just an interface

122
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,800
for sending a message back and forth to an agent.

123
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,760
So nothing AI about that in the least.

124
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:31,320
So it's just saying chatbot doesn't make it AI, but you have the chatbot interface.

125
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:36,760
You have the neural network, which is really where the AI comes into play, and this is trained,

126
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,800
so we trained ours on four months' worth of chat and Twitter data, which allows a customer

127
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,640
to ask any kind of question, you know, they can phrase it any way they want.

128
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,240
And then the system is smart enough to pull out the intent from that question, and then

129
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,880
match it with one of hundreds of answers that pretty much is in, you know, like a database

130
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
type list.

131
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,000
So that's another important element.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,560
Taking it back a step and looking at it at a higher level, what services are we providing

133
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,560
on there?

134
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,120
So when you go into our chatbot or our messaging interface, I should say, it's actually

135
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,480
going to guide you based on intent down one of three paths.

136
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:15,240
So one is, yes, you can ask that open question, and the AI will pull back one of hundreds

137
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,320
of answers and help you along your way, right?

138
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,000
And we don't pretend that this is, you know, super future.

139
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,680
I mean, this is, it is where it is right now, and that means that we can give you hundreds

140
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,200
of good, but simple answers, right?

141
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,800
And then complicated is definitely going to a human agent.

142
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,080
So then we have option number two, which is human agent.

143
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,640
So that will be if we can't answer your questions from the neural network, or simply if you type

144
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,000
in the word help, it will give you the human agent.

145
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And then the third one is, if we detect that you want to do a certain task, we have predefined

146
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,520
tasks like search for flight, track the status of a flight, you know, is it on time or whatever.

147
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:57,920
We have recommendations for hotels and sightseeing in our destinations.

148
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,480
We have notifications so you can get push notifications about the status of a flight, and

149
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,800
we have a couple other things.

150
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,600
So then you go down this kind of predefined path where you're not asking open questions.

151
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,000
It's just very much pre-programmed.

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,440
And that kind of chatbot interaction has also existed for some time.

153
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,560
So we're in this mixed space, and then there's also a trick of, you know, making that work

154
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
together, right?

155
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,720
So if you're passing it off to the human, the human, you know, takes the session quickly,

156
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,120
attends to it, puts them back in the default mode, which will send it to the chatbot again,

157
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:33,040
you know, those kind of tasks are also important to sketch out and implement.

158
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,400
Can you talk a little bit about what some of your goals as a business are in going down

159
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
this path?

160
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,880
Is it, you talked a little bit about for your website, kind of driving consumers to book

161
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,400
tickets there, and as a bit of a travel geek, I know that there are, you know, one of the

162
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,960
drivers for airlines in doing that.

163
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:58,360
So in doing those types of things is to reduce commissions that they pay out to third parties.

164
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,840
Are there similar motivations here?

165
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,920
Is it, you know, based on quality of service?

166
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,240
What are you hoping to achieve?

167
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,240
Yeah.

168
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
So that's really changed a lot.

169
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:13,840
We have the luxury of having this innovation area that I had up, and they give me a bit

170
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,160
of latitude.

171
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,720
So I don't have to go after hard and fast business goal with some of this emerging technology.

172
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,600
So back in 2016, in April, when Facebook came out, everybody was saying, oh, this is

173
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,000
great for booking tickets sell, sell, sell.

174
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,920
So you know, we had that life for a year, and we were just seeing that no one was buying

175
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
tickets.

176
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:37,560
I mean, you know, I don't want to say the number, but it's very low actual number of tickets.

177
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,240
But a lot of shopping, a lot of questions, but we really saw those questions take off.

178
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,200
People loved it when we had infigues, and then we added the neural network that was around.

179
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,400
That was in the spring of this year.

180
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,480
So when we added the neural network, you know, we saw that take off.

181
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,560
So we saw that people wanted to use this channel for customer service, and it made sense.

182
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,400
Now, looking back with 2020 vision, you could say, yeah, yeah, you could have figured that

183
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:06,120
out a long, but I mean, realistically, we weren't experts in this, you know, so we saw

184
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,280
that customer service is really the killer user case for this, and also people shopping

185
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,280
for tickets.

186
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,920
It's perfectly fine with me if people want to shop for tickets on the chat, and then we

187
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,080
direct them to the website.

188
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,240
We're also in a market where a lot of people want to be attended to personally.

189
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,880
It's a very different culture from the United States.

190
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:30,040
You have people that simply are, they don't have 10 years of history of using Amazon and

191
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,760
eBay and all this stuff.

192
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,920
It's not in the culture.

193
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,200
So if you want us to transfer, you know, if they want us to transfer them over to a human

194
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,240
agent, I'm perfectly happy with that too.

195
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,400
Also direct sale for us, no commissions, you know, et cetera, and that's what we're working

196
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
on as well.

197
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,800
So we want to extend this platform to our call center personnel who will start picking

198
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:55,080
up the chat, adding a payment solution so that people can pay safely on their smartphones

199
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,760
while they're chatting to the agent, the agent won't ever see their data or anything

200
00:12:58,760 --> 00:12:59,760
like that.

201
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:07,080
So, yeah, it's a lot of different functions that work on the channel, but it is not actually

202
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,440
booking a ticket right with the chatbot.

203
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,400
It's also everything but that.

204
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
Okay.

205
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:22,160
I think if I'm correct, the airlines have a term for the number of people that are shopping

206
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:26,280
versus actually buying tickets, I think it's the book ratio.

207
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
Yeah, correct.

208
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:34,040
And so it's typically what you found in looking at the chatbot is pretty typical for other

209
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,200
types of booking experiences as well, right?

210
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,680
The number of tickets relative to the number of tire kickers, if you will, is pretty low.

211
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,680
Is that right?

212
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,040
Yeah, that's absolutely correct.

213
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,680
And that's what's happening on mobile anyway.

214
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,720
So even when you have an awesome mobile website, that was actually the first thing that we

215
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,960
did when we redid the website was we said it had to be responsive and the mobile experience

216
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:57,600
has to be as good as the desktop experience.

217
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:04,720
But even then we're seeing around 10% of our direct digital sales coming from cell phones,

218
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,800
even though the traffic is approaching 50%, right?

219
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,080
And for what I know from the US market, that's also typical.

220
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:16,680
Now the stats that you can actually get out in public are mostly about hotels or they

221
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,400
come from China, right?

222
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:23,160
So you're starting to see things like 30% of flight bookings in China, supposedly, are

223
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,440
coming from mobile, you know, most of the hotel bookings.

224
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,000
But in North America, we're still in the tens.

225
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,040
I'm kind of okay with that as long as we don't lose the customer.

226
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,600
The problem is the customer that shops on the mobile and then doesn't come back to us

227
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,760
when they come to the desktop.

228
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,320
So that's why we do want to keep trying to capture that payment.

229
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,160
You know, mobile website is another story, but here on the chatbot, that's why bringing

230
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:52,000
in the human agents who can close the sale, then there's a safe, secure payment method

231
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,040
and convenient on your cell phone.

232
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,560
So we can close that sale out and make sure we get that sale and not an online travel

233
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,560
agency.

234
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Right.

235
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,240
You mentioned that you're, and I forget the metric that you said, whether it was usage

236
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,160
or, or kind of the experience, increase significantly when you brought the neural network

237
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
online.

238
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
Can you elaborate on that?

239
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,760
What exactly was it about bringing on your own models that you train that, you know,

240
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,720
fundamentally changed the way people use the messaging experience?

241
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
Yeah.

242
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,760
When we first rolled out the chatbot in September 2016, we only had an FAQ section.

243
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:35,480
So it was limited to certain topics, yeah, like luggage and where do you fly and things

244
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
like that.

245
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,480
So it was very static and the chances that we would actually address the question that

246
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,880
you had were relatively small.

247
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:48,360
And now you can literally come into the chatbot and ask anything and we'll give you access

248
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,360
to hundreds and hundreds of, you know, basically any information we would provide over the

249
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,880
web and then some is available in the answers.

250
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,880
Okay.

251
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:02,880
One of the, I've talked to a number of companies that are either on the provider side

252
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,320
of chatbots or the customer side, such as yourself.

253
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:14,240
And, you know, there are a number of commercial chatbot platforms out there.

254
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,520
Are you using one of those?

255
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:20,080
It sounds like you're not that you've got something that was developed from scratch by this

256
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:26,640
startup or yeah, I think that the market is still developing in that sense.

257
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,760
So if you're looking at the needs of a large corporate customer like an airline, I have

258
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,360
not seen anybody out there that has a complete solution that has all of these elements.

259
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,480
So again, that's the chatbot, the AI, neural network, the human agents, the front end for

260
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:48,240
the human agents, the backend integration into your sales force or your other CRM.

261
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,960
So all of these elements together, nobody actually delivers that in a package right now that

262
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
I am aware of.

263
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,240
Now, someone can contact me and correct me, but we've done a lot of market research into

264
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,240
this.

265
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,280
And there's hundreds of chatbot providers that can provide you a chatbot.

266
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,360
And when we started looking into even some of the best of these, some of the real big

267
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:08,000
names that I don't think I should name on a podcast, but some of these names that have

268
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,080
been around for many years are still literally selling you just the interface for someone

269
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,800
to chat to a human agent, right?

270
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:21,720
And I just think, I think that's, I just would never start a project like that in 2017,

271
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,600
because, you know, where's your plan to have all those other elements I'm talking about?

272
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,080
It's finding dandy to have human agents, you need that, but you need all those other

273
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,960
elements in there.

274
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,280
So a couple of those big names, both global and regional, either provided that or there

275
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,120
was another one regional here in Latin America that had table-driven questions and answers.

276
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,480
So instead of AI and a neural network, you would actually type in the questions and answers

277
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,480
yourself.

278
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,160
And then they would help you out by adding some grammatical variations and verb conjugations

279
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,200
and stuff like that, but basically it was table-driven.

280
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,600
So you're also talking about an old technology.

281
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,720
And then you get, you know, other people coming to visit you and they've got elements, right?

282
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:04,600
They've got AI platforms, but they don't have all the other elements and integrations

283
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,600
built out.

284
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,000
And they'll gladly charge you hundreds of thousands of dollars to do that.

285
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,440
So I think it's a huge opportunity, particularly for a startup.

286
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,240
I think for this one here in Mexico, yellow chat, but also, you know, other ones around

287
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,560
the world to come with a full package, you know, if you come to someone like me and a corporate,

288
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,200
they don't necessarily know that they need this all.

289
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,120
We've discovered this and built this over a year.

290
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:31,440
So I think this is something you can take, kind of copy paste that whole modular concept

291
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,880
and start selling it out to corporate.

292
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,120
So I'm sure we'll start seeing that in the next year or two, you know, just like you

293
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,920
have companies that do that for e-commerce for you.

294
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,440
You'll have that for messaging.

295
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,440
All right.

296
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
All right.

297
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,000
Do you know if they're using any off-to-shelf pieces on the AI side of things?

298
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Yeah.

299
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,440
So no, we actually built the neural network custom because the idea was, well, we built

300
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,680
a company out of L.A. called IV.ai, I want to give them credit because that worked out

301
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,360
also very well for us.

302
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,640
The reason that a tailored approach was chosen wasn't particular.

303
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:08,960
The type of content, right?

304
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,360
So this is not only Spanish, it's not only the variety of Spanish that's spoken in Mexico.

305
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,280
It's the way that people express themselves when they're asking questions relating to our

306
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,520
services.

307
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,520
And that varies.

308
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,280
That's so different from even other verticals within Mexico that you have to have historical

309
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
data.

310
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,920
So this was done on a custom basis.

311
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:37,640
And did you evaluate platforms like API.ai and others and found that they couldn't handle

312
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,640
those particular issues for you?

313
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,240
Well, not me personally know.

314
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,160
So I depend on yellow chat for that.

315
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:49,000
And this is what they told me, you know, this was a bit what they told me about their internal

316
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,840
decision making, but we relied on them for that choice.

317
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
Got it.

318
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
All right.

319
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,840
Great.

320
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:58,240
And then where do you see AI going at, era, Mexico?

321
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,240
It's actually the main focus of our innovation area.

322
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,040
So I shouldn't mention the innovation area I'm in is within the commercial and customer service

323
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
area.

324
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,640
So not really in the operations, I'm not looking so much at how people, I don't know,

325
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,640
you know, pass through security gates or things like that.

326
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,240
I'm looking a lot at distribution and customer service solutions and AI has the ability to

327
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,040
help us automate but optimize more than anything a lot of different areas.

328
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,480
So one completely different application would be in our marketing area, right?

329
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,640
We have the ability now.

330
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,800
We have all the tools in place to send people an absolutely individual email.

331
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,520
You know, for millions of millions of people getting a different email, but there's actually,

332
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:45,200
you know, a lot of people will say they have this, but no one can actually help you construct

333
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,200
that email.

334
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,200
Okay.

335
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,360
We have all this all this data about you in our CRM.

336
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,160
We know all your personal data.

337
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,400
We can segment you.

338
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,800
We can guess at your income.

339
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,000
We know your geographical location.

340
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
We know what you've bought from us before or haven't bought from us.

341
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
All right.

342
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,240
And we also have stuff product that we need to push, right?

343
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,480
We have routes where there's a lot of seats available.

344
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,000
So how do you combine all that into millions of different emails?

345
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,720
So no one has a way to do that.

346
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,720
So really, now that's not necessarily AI to compose the email that, but you need some

347
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,560
powerful machines to do that.

348
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,920
But then you execute the campaign, you analyze it, and then you go ahead and you do better

349
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,080
the next time around.

350
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,040
Now that is machine learning, right?

351
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,200
And I think only machine learning can bring us to that scale.

352
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:35,200
So imagine the power of email marketing where the response rate is four or five times or

353
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,480
maybe even ten times what you had before in these generic things.

354
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,640
And it's not just email.

355
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,160
We also have the ability to do a different website for each individual with a tool called

356
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,480
optimizely.

357
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,560
We have our digital marketing where we put out our ads.

358
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:56,080
Now those are already highly tailored because the ad vendors provide a lot of tools to segment

359
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,720
target markets and even individuals, but having the CRM data directly feed into what we

360
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,720
request from those advertisers makes it still much more powerful.

361
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,320
So that's another area, but we can go on, basically harnessing all this fast data, big

362
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,560
data, which is such a buzzword, right?

363
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,240
But how do you actually do that?

364
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,960
So that's another area of focus.

365
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:29,360
Do you see this happening via a portfolio of essentially independent projects, or do

366
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:37,560
you see the evolution of a platform that provides some core sets of AI services that these

367
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:44,720
different teams can use to build AI into the things that they do, like the email marketing,

368
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,720
customer service, et cetera?

369
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,920
That's a really thought-provoking question because I'll tell you the one company that

370
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,720
has made their presence known in a big way is Google, right?

371
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,000
They have this big data platform and data crunching where you can pay as you go.

372
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,920
It's a very attractive option that everybody immediately got excited about.

373
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,240
And I'm sure there's actually competitors out there that have similar products.

374
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,680
Honestly, we haven't looked into that into the competitors and a lot of depth.

375
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:15,480
So definitely a platform will be there, but what's definitely missing is the strategic

376
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,480
direction, right?

377
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,880
A company like, we don't want to pay millions to some major consulting company to give

378
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,880
us direction.

379
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
That doesn't make sense.

380
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,320
I mean, there should be, I think we're going to coalesce around common sense directions

381
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,680
that big companies have to go in when it comes to an AI strategy.

382
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,280
But I don't think we're there yet.

383
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
Not at all.

384
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,280
I haven't seen that.

385
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:42,200
So I think for the moment, we're still in the phase of investigating in a very individual

386
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:48,280
way, the problems that we want to solve, so that that's not knowledge that is prepackaged

387
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,520
or readily accessible.

388
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,640
And I think that's why we'll see a lot of individual projects, even though we might

389
00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:00,480
all be on the same sort of big data platform as a tool.

390
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,680
Those types of platforms can be vendor delivered or can be an internal platform that develops

391
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,600
at Aero, Mexico, kind of for its own specific use cases.

392
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:20,160
It sounds like you're still at the stage where you're identifying use cases to experiment

393
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,640
with and use them as learning opportunities.

394
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,920
Is that a fair assessment?

395
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,920
Yeah.

396
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:26,920
That sounds about accurate.

397
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Yeah.

398
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,320
Also, keep in mind that we're about one tenth the size of large US airlines, right?

399
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,560
The digital were about 50% of the penetration that they have in terms of online sales.

400
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,120
So our budgets and our staffs are conventionally smaller.

401
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,760
So normally we would be looking for solutions to kind of thought to coalesce in the US,

402
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,200
start to be implemented, and then that stuff comes trickling down to Mexico.

403
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,880
But the fact that we are pushing ahead on these individual products starts to give us

404
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,480
a vision of maybe we're ahead of the game, certainly in Mexico, as to where that vision

405
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:10,080
is going to go around platform and strategy for AI as a layer that goes across the business.

406
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,680
That's a really good point.

407
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,680
Yeah.

408
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:18,000
And I think that's characteristic of companies, many, many companies in the US as well.

409
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,120
You mentioned an AI strategy.

410
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,920
Is that something that do you have an articulated AI strategy at this time at Aero, Mexico?

411
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,800
No, I think you're catching us in the phase where we're starting to look at where can

412
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,120
we apply this across the different things.

413
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:38,320
So I gave you a marketing example, but we're right in the middle of starting to sketch,

414
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:45,360
looking at customer service, customer experience, which is your whole end-to-end travel experience,

415
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,560
marketing, what else do we have here?

416
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:52,880
So basically everything in the commercial sales, of course, how we deal with our agency

417
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,080
customers, how we deal with our online travel agencies, how we deal with distribution

418
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,040
in general, metastures and stuff like that.

419
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,600
So there's opportunities there, I think, to optimize processes and do new things with

420
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
AI.

421
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,960
And we're starting to look at all those and make an inventory and see where we can get

422
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,960
the most bank for the buck in our next few projects.

423
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:13,960
Awesome.

424
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,960
Awesome.

425
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,680
And I imagine this feels a little bit like when folks are starting to grapple with mobile

426
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,160
and trying to figure out how that all is going to impact things and what's the right

427
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,840
place to start and what are the right tools and technologies.

428
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:37,720
Are there any lessons that you bring from previous waves of innovation to the way you're

429
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,600
tackling AI?

430
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,400
I think that's a really good analogy.

431
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,640
I haven't thought of that.

432
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,760
Remembering back a few years, I was very frustrated that you would read even sometimes

433
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:53,560
in very reputable, made-line publications, stuff that just confused all the different aspects

434
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
of mobile.

435
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,560
Right?

436
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,560
Right?

437
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,560
What's mobile?

438
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
So mobile payments.

439
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:03,280
Does that mean when you're buying something on a mobile website or does it mean when you're

440
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,640
tapping your phone someplace and you get all these people that would mix that all up together

441
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,960
and misuse that in fact to sell services and consulting?

442
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,280
So I think this is the same thing.

443
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:19,400
You've got to have an expert within the organization, in this case, that's me who's filtering through

444
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,520
all the noise and saying, okay, what is it that this really does?

445
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,920
So we've determined that this is really about optimizing, well, in the case of things like

446
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:35,800
marketing, it's about optimizing outputs, optimizing execution of processes as well as some

447
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,800
other things.

448
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,760
But knowing those things very clearly and what you're trying to achieve with that and not

449
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:46,760
just taking a technology and trying to find a solution, what do you call a solution in

450
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
search of a problem?

451
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
Right.

452
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,760
Exactly.

453
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,760
And in some sense, we did that.

454
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,800
Like when chatbots first came out, we just got on board and started playing around, you

455
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,160
know, for a few tens of thousands of dollars, basically, we were able to experiment and

456
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:04,320
that's valuable experience and everybody should try and have that innovation area that's

457
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,000
able to do that because that helps you sort out like what's really going on, right?

458
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,200
What is this really for?

459
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,440
But in parallel, yeah, building up a strategy where you're like, okay, what do I want to

460
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
achieve with this?

461
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
Right.

462
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
Awesome.

463
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,720
Well, Brian, I really appreciate you taking the time.

464
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,720
Is there anything else that you'd like to leave the audience with?

465
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,000
No, I think you hit upon a lot of the main points.

466
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
It's really good.

467
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,680
I just think this is an exciting time to be in AI.

468
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,880
There's a lot of discovery going on.

469
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,560
You know, we're in the process of, you know, these solutions like coalescing into kind

470
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,120
of a common sense across companies like this is what we need to do, right?

471
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,760
These are all the elements that go into a messaging, a chat, and AI platforms.

472
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,880
So it's great to be part of that.

473
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,520
And, you know, I think the audience, the conferences are all going to be having different roles

474
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,520
in that.

475
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,480
And I'm also looking forward to learning from all the other presentations, the conference

476
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,480
and all the other applications of AI and business that we can hopefully apply some of those

477
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,720
here at the airline.

478
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:02,720
Mm-hmm.

479
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,720
Fantastic.

480
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
Well, thanks, Brian.

481
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
It was great chatting with you.

482
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
I appreciate it.

483
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,720
All right.

484
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:15,040
Everyone, that's our show for today.

485
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:20,160
Thanks so much for listening and for your continued feedback and support.
