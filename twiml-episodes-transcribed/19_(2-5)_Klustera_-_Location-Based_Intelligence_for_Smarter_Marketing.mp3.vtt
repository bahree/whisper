00:00.000 --> 00:20.360
Alright everyone, I am here with Palo Martinez and Carlo Rodriguez from Clustera, live once

00:20.360 --> 00:32.240
again from NYU Future Labs and the AI Nexus Accelerator. Guys, say hi. Hi. So let's just jump

00:32.240 --> 00:36.920
right in and have you tell us a little bit about Clustera, what are you guys up to?

00:36.920 --> 00:42.760
Sure, well we started as a retail analytics company like enabling Carlo and I worked

00:42.760 --> 00:49.080
at a marketing innovation firm and we were wondering what could happen if Walmart had

00:49.080 --> 00:54.400
the same data that Amazon has. How could they grow their businesses? And the pursuit

00:54.400 --> 01:01.560
of that response took us to where we are now. We attract people's movements on physical

01:01.560 --> 01:09.760
spaces based on their anonymous Wi-Fi signals and we got some traction on that space but then

01:09.760 --> 01:15.880
we found out we realized that that wasn't like we're the value recited, right? Like just

01:15.880 --> 01:21.120
by tracking the people, what we understood, like working with some of the major players

01:21.120 --> 01:29.560
in the market in Mexico, such as Anhauser-Busch, Walmart and Valaris, that's a very large

01:29.560 --> 01:37.200
airline there, is that the real value resides in delivering relevant advertising to the

01:37.200 --> 01:45.160
users based on their behavior in the real world and that's where Clustera is now at.

01:45.160 --> 01:51.720
So you're not no longer focused on the Wi-Fi movement element of it or is that still part

01:51.720 --> 01:56.240
of the building block? Yeah, it's a bit of a block but instead of using the cell in

01:56.240 --> 02:01.760
the data as a dashboard or something like that, we use that data to correlate the behavior

02:01.760 --> 02:06.840
of the people with their profiles, the data we get and then we target those people.

02:06.840 --> 02:15.080
Okay, and so the general idea then is to allow so-called brick and mortar retailers to

02:15.080 --> 02:21.080
have more of the kind of give them, you know, with an online retailer, you know exactly

02:21.080 --> 02:28.040
what the customer does from their page path as well as maybe even heat map eye tracking

02:28.040 --> 02:33.040
that kind of stuff. And so this is trying to capture some of that same kind of insight

02:33.040 --> 02:37.960
for the brick and mortar retailer. Yes, to capture that insight but also to activate

02:37.960 --> 02:44.680
it. Okay, we realized that, for example, Google and Facebook, they're massive companies

02:44.680 --> 02:50.360
which their business model resides just in one simple idea is to make advertising more

02:50.360 --> 02:57.080
relevant to the people. I think that's why they're so big. But they are just like online

02:57.080 --> 03:04.280
to online. The things that you do online, they get transformed into online advertising.

03:04.280 --> 03:11.560
But no company yet has really tackled, really nailed how to take the offline behavior

03:11.560 --> 03:18.040
of the people and translate it into online advertising, which is important because online

03:18.040 --> 03:24.520
digital advertising is growing like two digits per year since I remember. So it's going

03:24.520 --> 03:31.960
to get just bigger and companies need that data to better deliver their campaigns.

03:31.960 --> 03:38.040
And so are you telling them, you're telling them with the data that you've collected,

03:38.040 --> 03:43.400
who to target, but what else are you telling them, how to target them, where to target them,

03:47.000 --> 03:51.160
and are you providing an advertising network or are you telling them which advertising

03:51.160 --> 03:56.520
networks to use? Tell me a little bit more about how a customer uses what you're providing.

03:56.520 --> 04:01.000
Sure. Well, first I'm going to give you like a glimpse of how the solution works.

04:01.000 --> 04:05.800
Okay. And then I'm going to let Carlo like go a little bit technically deeper.

04:05.800 --> 04:13.480
Okay. What we do is we interpret the, we hear the Wi-Fi signals of the smartphones.

04:13.480 --> 04:19.240
Right. And they have all the audience most know that the MAC address is like the anonymous

04:19.240 --> 04:27.000
device ID. We hear that and we can pinpoint where is that device located in a very,

04:27.000 --> 04:35.240
very accurate way. Instead of geofencing that has a 500 meter like accuracy,

04:35.240 --> 04:44.360
we have a 10 meter accuracy. So, so that's the first thing. Second, as people will

04:44.360 --> 04:50.840
gathering a lot of data from the city like the Google card does, we also map out the whole city,

04:50.840 --> 04:57.800
but the routers in the city. Okay. So we map the city literally, we like to

04:57.800 --> 05:06.280
do it, exactly where all the Wi-Fi is for time. Okay. And commercial, all pieces of space, and also

05:06.280 --> 05:07.720
organization. Oh, so we're not talking about movements within the store. We're talking about

05:07.720 --> 05:14.440
movements out the world. Yeah. Above. Like inbound and outbound. Okay. Well, or outside the store,

05:14.440 --> 05:20.920
like an urban level, like a city level, but also inside the store. Okay.

05:20.920 --> 05:29.640
Okay. And so you are collecting all this, this database, you're basically locating the

05:29.640 --> 05:33.320
individuals. And then what are you doing with that data? How are you aggregating it?

05:33.320 --> 05:41.000
Well, we aggregated as analytics, as Scarlett said, dashboards. Like, so our clients can understand

05:41.800 --> 05:49.000
when do they users arrive? How much time do they spend? How do they move inside the store?

05:49.000 --> 05:57.000
But also as users naturally connect to Wi-Fi on certain locations, then with the opt-in,

05:57.000 --> 06:05.480
like with the consent of the user, we can match their device IDs to their online profiles.

06:06.040 --> 06:13.080
And in that way, we can like make the whole cycle and start delivering smart campaigns.

06:13.080 --> 06:20.200
For example, one of our clients is a major burger chain in here in the US. And they're using

06:20.200 --> 06:27.800
our solution for a lot of stuff. But one of the main points is to understand how people,

06:27.800 --> 06:36.040
like their loyalty, their recency, how often do they go. And if they notice a pattern,

06:36.040 --> 06:43.400
and that's where one of the ways that we use machine learning and AI for our product,

06:43.400 --> 06:49.800
if we identify that the user is going to churn, like it's going to bail out for a competitor,

06:49.800 --> 06:55.800
because we compare their behavior to a lot of past behavior from other profiles.

06:56.920 --> 07:02.920
Then we send an aggressive campaign to that user, because we know that he is like in danger

07:02.920 --> 07:10.200
of bailing out of the brand. And so to make that a little bit more concrete,

07:11.960 --> 07:21.480
I'm a burger chain A customer. If I spend more time in an area that you might surmise,

07:21.480 --> 07:28.200
I'm sitting in a burger chain B, is that an example? Or are you finding deeper patterns

07:28.200 --> 07:35.000
that would suggest that I might be more likely to churn? Well, there are three main

07:36.200 --> 07:43.560
like things that we look at in building the model. Okay. First is as people connect to the places,

07:43.560 --> 07:52.440
well generally they connect to the places they go to eat, like to have food, that we can have

07:52.440 --> 07:59.960
like a sense of the competitors. If you go to somewhere, we can know if you have connected to

07:59.960 --> 08:07.080
some competitor. First, second, we can understand where people live and work based on their previous

08:07.080 --> 08:15.400
Wi-Fi locations. So we can understand the socio-economical status of the person in that sense,

08:15.400 --> 08:24.280
that it's like they comply with that. And third, we see the patterns of the visits,

08:24.280 --> 08:30.920
just like in Google Analytics, or in any like analytics, we have an analytics suite. You can see

08:30.920 --> 08:39.400
how often the person goes. If they go daily, if they go weekly, if they go two times a month.

08:39.400 --> 08:46.120
And then we compare that and we see, oh, we have seen some similar behaving customers that after

08:46.120 --> 08:53.720
bail, after not going to the burger chain in three weeks, we never see them again.

08:54.440 --> 08:59.640
That's when we know that we have to activate some campaign. Okay. Okay, interesting.

09:00.360 --> 09:03.400
Tell me a little bit about your backgrounds and how you arrived at this problem.

09:03.400 --> 09:09.320
Yeah, well, as Paul mentioned before, we met at the market in agency. I was a head of innovation.

09:09.320 --> 09:14.360
My background is at the telecommunications engineer. I was in a gig since I was a kid. I learned

09:14.360 --> 09:20.120
to call when I was 13, just from phone. And the thing is that it put me all through this to call

09:20.120 --> 09:25.400
this and everything. I went to Singularity University and I was being, I am a maker. I've been

09:25.400 --> 09:36.520
drones. Okay, sure. Well, we met there and at a marketing agency, I was a BP of analytics.

09:37.160 --> 09:43.880
And all my whole career was in the marketing and analytics space. I majored in, well,

09:43.880 --> 09:50.200
my knowledge in marketing, but I majored in applied statistics and then I studied a master's

09:50.200 --> 09:58.120
degree in analytical sciences. So I always like tried to solve marketing problems using analytics

09:58.120 --> 10:03.800
and data. And Carlo asked, he is very strong with technology and sensors. It was like a perfect match

10:03.800 --> 10:11.080
for this venture. One of the things that I'm sure you get asked a lot is around the privacy

10:11.080 --> 10:18.520
implications of what you're doing. How do you, you know, what are the questions that you're most

10:18.520 --> 10:28.120
asked around that? And how do you respond to those? Sure. Well, they ask us a lot of about that

10:28.120 --> 10:37.720
because it's like a sensical topic. We know that we're not the first company to aggregate customer

10:37.720 --> 10:44.520
behavior and activate campaigns. A lot of companies have done that before. And we know that we're

10:44.520 --> 10:49.960
not the only company that tracks people's movements with cell phones, with cell phone signals.

10:51.640 --> 10:58.360
But first and foremost, we know that if we that we have to put privacy at like the first of every

10:58.360 --> 11:05.800
decision that we make, because at the end of the day, we are not interested in individual

11:05.800 --> 11:11.160
behaviors, but on aggregated behaviors. Like that's why we're called clostera because of the

11:11.160 --> 11:19.640
cluster analysis that we do for the people. So in terms of how the two main questions that we

11:19.640 --> 11:29.080
get asked is this legal? And the answer is yes. We have a very solid legal framework that

11:30.280 --> 11:36.040
like allows, for example, to gather aggregated data and make sense of it in terms of

11:36.040 --> 11:43.960
dashboards of analytics without infraging any kind of privacy law or anything, nor in Latam or

11:43.960 --> 11:52.280
the US. And second is, well, if it's anonymous, how do you can activate campaigns? And the answer to

11:52.280 --> 12:01.400
that question is that when the user opts into our platform, they complied that we can use their

12:01.400 --> 12:08.760
data to send more relevant advertising. And that's what Google and Facebook does. They take,

12:09.480 --> 12:14.120
for example, your birthday and they send some special promotion because it's your birthday.

12:14.120 --> 12:19.080
I don't think that any of you can like argue or be mad about it.

12:20.200 --> 12:27.480
And so are all of the users opted in users? And what are they actually opting into? Is it

12:27.480 --> 12:32.440
some app that you're providing or something that the customer is providing that they want to get

12:32.440 --> 12:41.800
some value from? It's the Wi-Fi portal. And I get Wi-Fi networks. Okay. So and you guys are running

12:41.800 --> 12:47.480
the Wi-Fi networks. So you have agreements with existing Wi-Fi networks to do this? Both, both.

12:47.480 --> 12:56.520
Okay. Yeah, we can go and install just a sensor or like a Wi-Fi sensor. It's like a very small router.

12:56.520 --> 13:04.680
Okay. That goes up on top of the existing Wi-Fi technology that all our clients have.

13:05.240 --> 13:10.440
Or if there are some hotspot companies that we're partnering in Mexico, where we just

13:11.080 --> 13:18.520
like put our platform in their existing sensors and then we can match the user profiles.

13:18.520 --> 13:24.440
I was going to ask about this earlier and we'd moved on to something else. The degree to which

13:24.440 --> 13:30.360
the infrastructure needs to be changed in order to support what you're doing. And it sounds like

13:31.720 --> 13:38.440
it sounds like yes. So does that mean that in order to in order to grow you need to

13:39.640 --> 13:46.200
like who do you have to go after these Wi-Fi portal owners basically?

13:47.400 --> 13:53.640
What are they? But they're not the beneficiaries of analytics necessarily. That's the retailer.

13:53.640 --> 13:59.160
So what's in it for them? How do you make them want to get engaged with you guys?

13:59.960 --> 14:06.360
Well, first we give them the ability to better serve their clients without spending more,

14:06.360 --> 14:13.640
like without because they give a very simple dashboard, simple analytics of the Wi-Fi.

14:13.640 --> 14:21.160
And we tell them how if you put this code in your portal, then you will be able to give a better

14:21.160 --> 14:25.240
product to the client that is paying you and you don't have to pay anything.

14:25.720 --> 14:31.160
Okay. And it sounds like an interesting and complex ecosystem. So you've got the portal folks

14:31.160 --> 14:40.120
that they maybe are their clients like Starbucks or someone that's hosting that's providing

14:40.120 --> 14:50.040
at their location and then you guys are trying to use the data for the retailer. Well, it's more change. They already

14:50.040 --> 14:55.480
are providing Wi-Fi to their customers. In this case, these chains, they also like we get on top of

14:55.480 --> 15:01.880
what they have. And in this case, these chains always have contracts, maybe locations and that's

15:01.880 --> 15:08.920
what we also have. Okay. Okay. Makes sense. So maybe a little bit more on how you're using

15:08.920 --> 15:15.560
machine learning and AI to solve as what kinds of techniques and approaches come into play to

15:15.560 --> 15:21.000
solve this particular problem. Well, as I mentioned before, you see that part of the analytics

15:21.000 --> 15:25.240
is a building block towards the end product. That is the blockchain and audience. It's great,

15:25.240 --> 15:31.160
great targeting profiles for the people. In the case of the analytics literature to measure people,

15:31.160 --> 15:37.400
we need to identify which people is a visitor of the place and a passerby. Since from that

15:37.400 --> 15:44.920
perspective, we need to classify those type of customers. The raw data that we get is a very

15:44.920 --> 15:50.200
messy data because it's a lot of data that is coming from the cell phones is literally signals

15:50.200 --> 15:56.280
from the cell phones. And we use models to classify which one is in the store, which was passing

15:56.280 --> 16:01.960
in front of the store. And then after that, classify them in bucket like, okay, this is a new

16:01.960 --> 16:09.160
comer is a returning visitor, et cetera, et cetera. Yeah, also to predict future behavior. We get

16:09.160 --> 16:14.680
that asked a lot like, where is the AI and what you have because in some other companies is very

16:14.680 --> 16:23.080
straightforward. Right. However, in ourselves, we think like 10 years ago, maybe it was or 20 years

16:23.080 --> 16:30.280
ago, it was very hot to say you were an internet company. Sure. And now it's very hot to say we're

16:30.280 --> 16:39.160
you're an AI company. And we think that that it's going to like, how do you say that? Like,

16:39.160 --> 16:46.760
it's going to permeate in all companies. So maybe in one or two years, it's not going to make

16:46.760 --> 16:51.400
sense to say that you are an AI company. Sure. Everybody is doing that. It's like you say,

16:51.400 --> 16:58.120
I'm an electric electricity energy company now. Right. Just because you use electricity.

16:58.120 --> 17:05.400
This is a tool. Yeah. You are in the tool business selling pickaxes. Well, you sell pickaxes.

17:05.400 --> 17:10.920
In this case, we use the pickaxes to build stuff. Right. Right. And the folks that listen to

17:10.920 --> 17:15.240
the podcast like to hear about what kind of pickaxes you use. And it sounds like clustering is a big

17:15.960 --> 17:20.120
one of the big pickaxes. You want to mean you want me to get pretty technical on this? Sure.

17:20.120 --> 17:25.000
Sure. Well, you see we have many many many branches here. First of all,

17:25.000 --> 17:29.880
is that all the holidays come for that. Of course, we use the cloud. Otherwise, we

17:29.880 --> 17:35.720
don't have any any any any on premiums and stuff. And then first of all, all these cloud

17:35.720 --> 17:40.920
go through that the pipeline that is drawn on the spark. Okay. We use to classification

17:40.920 --> 17:45.400
sees a logistic regression and a decision tree. And based on that. What was the first one?

17:45.400 --> 17:50.280
A logistic regression. Just a regression. Got it. And a decision tree. And with that,

17:50.280 --> 17:57.960
we get to the analytic side and the first cluster, let's say, then we get the models for the

17:57.960 --> 18:03.640
clustering of the of the behavior of the people based on the profile and also the behavior they

18:05.480 --> 18:12.120
have some before. Yeah, that's my favorite part because we started using like her article clustering.

18:12.120 --> 18:17.000
But then we started pioneering with a technical, not pioneering, but using a technique called

18:17.000 --> 18:25.080
self-organizing maps that that it like takes all the features of the of the people and like makes

18:25.560 --> 18:31.960
like like self-organizing map. It's like a technique used more for like machine vision.

18:31.960 --> 18:37.960
Okay. Where we're using that to to make sense of all the the information of the of the data of

18:37.960 --> 18:47.240
the users and gather them into very more, more smart or smarter segments that if we use just plain

18:47.240 --> 18:52.360
clustering. Okay. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Yeah. And also we have different layers of information

18:52.360 --> 18:57.160
that we get from the people in the case of what is just analytics well is just an ID is your macadras.

18:57.160 --> 19:01.400
The macadras doesn't say anything about you. Right. That's why we are legal because it's not

19:01.400 --> 19:05.560
personal identifiable information. The macadras doesn't give you the names, they give you the

19:05.560 --> 19:08.680
phone numbers, they give you the email doesn't give you anything. Just the brand of the phone.

19:09.320 --> 19:14.040
Uh-huh. Okay. Well, how did you be having such a physical place? But in the case of the people

19:14.040 --> 19:20.280
opting in this in the Wi-Fi spots, we ask them to put an email. Oh, in these many 90% of the cases

19:20.840 --> 19:26.040
face to logging, social logging. Okay. And once we get the social logging, we can we can know the gender,

19:26.040 --> 19:33.160
the beard day, the likes, what pictures do they have like before. And based on that, we can literally

19:33.160 --> 19:38.680
create a really good profile of what about you because, okay, do I see you in a hotspot that is

19:38.680 --> 19:44.600
in a brewery or in a coffee place? And then I see you in another city, et cetera, et cetera.

19:44.600 --> 19:49.400
It's literally reflecting your behavior. Right. And then with those closer, with those

19:49.400 --> 19:56.600
audiences is where the way we make business. Okay. Okay. Well, that's exciting stuff. Can you

19:56.600 --> 20:01.880
maybe share anything else you'd like to add or maybe you can share how folks can find you and learn

20:01.880 --> 20:09.240
