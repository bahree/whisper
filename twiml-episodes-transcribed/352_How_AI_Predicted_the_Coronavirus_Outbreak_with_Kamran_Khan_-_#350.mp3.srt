Welcome to the Tumel AI Podcast. I'm your host, Sam Charrington.

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:28,240
Alright everyone, I am on the line with Cameron Khan. Cameron is founder and CEO of Blue Dot,

3
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,840
as well as a professor of medicine and public health at the University of Toronto.

4
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,840
Cameron, welcome to the Tumel AI Podcast. Thanks for having me. It's great to be here.

5
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:45,040
It is really, really exciting to chat with you. So you originally came on our radar as a result

6
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,880
of a wired article that came out not too long ago about how your company Blue Dot used AI to

7
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:59,280
be among the first to warn about the coronavirus. You probably have much more precise words

8
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,200
around exactly what the role that your company is playing in that. But let's start out by having

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:13,200
you share a little bit about your background and what brought you to apply machine learning

10
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,040
and artificial intelligence to this problem of early identification and warning of diseases.

11
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,240
Yeah, for sure. So maybe I'll start out by just providing a little bit of background about

12
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,040
myself and ultimately what was the motivation for this work. So, you know, I'm a practicing

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,480
infectious disease physician. I, you know, still just seeing a bunch of patients this morning with

14
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:42,960
tuberculosis and managing that and I'm originally from Toronto. You know, I did my medical school

15
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,560
training here. But I specialized in infectious diseases and public health and I was down in New

16
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:57,360
York finishing up my training in 2002 and then moved back to Toronto just before the SARS outbreak

17
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:05,760
happened. So Toronto, as I mentioned, is where I grew up and home. When I got here, you know,

18
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:15,840
shortly after arriving, we had this outbreak of the SARS coronavirus 17 years ago and it was

19
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,120
something that we didn't really even know what it was until it showed up in our hospitals in our

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,760
city. And as a physician specialized in infectious diseases and in public health, you know,

21
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,200
if I didn't know what this was, I don't know how anyone else would know what it was. And so it

22
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:41,280
really became apparent that we need better systems to be able to detect and anticipate how infectious

23
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,120
diseases might emerge and spread and we know that they do that really quickly. The reason why

24
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:55,200
this was such a profound event for me personally was, you know, I got to see the impact of SARS on

25
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:04,000
our city really in a up close and kind of personal way. One of my colleagues got infected with SARS

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,960
and we had other healthcare workers who got SARS and who actually died. We had 44 deaths. We had

27
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:16,320
an outbreak involving over 250 people that went on for four very long months. Oh wow.

28
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,600
And so you can just imagine the amount of mental and emotional fatigue that sets into your

29
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,640
healthcare workforce. When day in and day out, you're trying to confront this thing. There's a

30
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,040
lot of personal protective equipment and gear that you got to be working and wearing in your

31
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,880
environment. And you know, there's always the concern that, you know, would you potentially get

32
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,680
this next? And are you going to take it back home to your family? So there was certainly an enormous

33
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,720
amount of concern there. We saw our hospitals completely overwhelmed. They went into lockdown.

34
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,640
All elective procedures were canceled. Our public health system was overwhelmed. And even the city

35
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,720
took on a different feel. It was one where, you know, people stopped traveling to Toronto.

36
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,960
So we didn't have the same kinds of people gathering. You know, there were billions in financial

37
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,000
losses to the city. So this was a really profound event. And if we take a look at the big picture,

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,160
Toronto was just one of dozens of cities around the world that were going through this outbreak,

39
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,200
Singapore and Hong Kong and Taipei and others. In fact, these are some of the cities right now that

40
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:34,640
are experiencing outbreaks of this new coronavirus. So for me, I think one of the key things

41
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,120
really at that point was we need a better system. We need a better system to be able to detect

42
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,560
outbreaks more quickly. We need a better system to be able to anticipate how they would spread.

43
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,560
And we need a mechanism to be able to rapidly communicate that information.

44
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,760
Was Toronto unique among North American cities in the impact of the SARS virus? I remember,

45
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,200
obviously, hearing about it at the time, but it didn't feel nearly as personal. I'm based in St.

46
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,560
Louis, but travel extensively to New York and San Francisco and other cities in the US.

47
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,200
So there were actually dozens of imported cases of SARS into North America.

48
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,120
It just so happened, and this is a point that maybe I'll come back to later on that in Toronto,

49
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,240
one of the cases led to a whole bunch of other cases and triggered an outbreak.

50
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:32,000
In many of the other cities, the cases were identified, quickly isolated, and there wasn't secondary

51
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,040
transmission that went on to lead to a broader outbreak. So Vancouver had cases in Canada,

52
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,000
and there were a bunch of US cities that had travelers who were infected with SARS, but it did

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:51,040
not trigger an ongoing outbreak. So Toronto was one of those places where we had an outbreak that

54
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:58,240
everyone heard about simply because we had case after case going on over a four-month period.

55
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:08,160
And you refer to it as the SARS coronavirus. What's the relationship between SARS and

56
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:13,920
coronavirus? Or maybe just define coronavirus? Is it a part of a category of viruses?

57
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:21,760
So, coronavirus is there are sort of two groups. First of all, the coronavirus is largely because

58
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,840
of the way the virus looks. It almost looks a bit like a child drawing a picture of the sun

59
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,760
with these kind of surface proteins that go out. And there are two broad categories.

60
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:39,920
Coronavirus can just cause the common cold. So these are not that unusual. But there are novel

61
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:45,840
coronaviruses, new coronaviruses that may have made the leap from animals into humans. And there

62
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:53,280
are two other ones prior to this. SARS back in 2003, which we think probably came from civet cats,

63
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,120
maybe originally from bats to an intermediate animal and then over to humans. And then MERS,

64
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,320
which is the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, that really came on the scene in 2012,

65
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:11,440
has mostly been in the Middle East around, centered mostly around Saudi Arabia. And that's

66
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,480
another coronavirus that's thought to actually originate from camels and then has spread to humans

67
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:25,520
and causes severe respiratory illness as well. The animal that is the source of this new coronavirus

68
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,720
is still being evaluated. You know, the Pangolin is one of the candidate animals that is being

69
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:38,400
discussed. But genetically, this is, you know, almost 80% similar to the SARS coronavirus. So they

70
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,560
sort of fall into the same family. You could almost think of them a bit like being cousins, if you

71
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:54,400
will, related in many ways genetically. And so the virus came about via mutation, I would imagine.

72
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,320
Is that the right term? Is that how these viruses get started? Not necessarily a mutation per se,

73
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:06,400
but what happens is they have a, what we call a zoonotic spillover. And what I mean by that is,

74
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:13,600
this virus is found in an animal, a human comes in contact with the virus and it just so happens

75
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:21,520
that the virus is sufficiently adapted to be able to replicate in human cells and then ultimately

76
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:29,840
become a human pathogen or a human disease. So that is, you know, this is similar to what we saw

77
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,480
during the SARS coronavirus. In fact, there's a bit of deja vu with this story here, which is,

78
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:43,040
if we look back to 2003, this was a pneumonia that developed in association with presumably

79
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,480
exposure to a live animal market that then triggered that outbreak. And here we are again,

80
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:56,160
17 years later, with another coronavirus associated with a live animal market that is now

81
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:03,120
created the next outbreak. And this one has, you know, some similarities and some differences from

82
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,640
SARS, but certainly is a much larger outbreak. It has now surpassed SARS, you know, many fold in

83
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:17,280
terms of number of cases. And even now the total number of deaths has surpassed what we saw in 2003

84
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:24,240
with the SARS outbreak. Talk a little bit about the role of early warning and the importance of

85
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,000
or the motivation for what you're doing at Blue Dot. Let me just tell you a little bit about the

86
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,360
the kind of evolution. So first of all, as I mentioned, I'm a practicing physician. I'm an

87
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:43,680
epidemiologist by training. So after the SARS outbreak ended, you know, one of the things that

88
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,560
first came to my mind was let's not do this again. Let's think about another way that perhaps we

89
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:55,120
could better anticipate this. And I spent the next 10 years as a scientist and as a professor at the

90
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,160
University of Toronto studying outbreaks trying to understand, are there ways that we could better

91
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,560
anticipate how these diseases spread around the world? Now we know that ultimately these diseases

92
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,320
that affect humans are spread by the movements of humans. And the long distant movements of people

93
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,320
this generally occurs through commercial air travel around the world and this network, which is

94
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,200
you know, it's not even 100 years old of commercial air travel has really transformed how people

95
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,400
move around the world and ultimately how microbes move around the world. So I spent, you know,

96
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:37,760
the next 10 years studying that and realized from various outbreaks that you actually could start

97
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:44,720
to potentially anticipate how these diseases would spread. I started working with billions of

98
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:52,000
anonymized passenger flight itinerary tickets and sales and those types of data. You know,

99
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,280
it kind of dawned on me that I could learn and understand that C-164 or 16B or something was

100
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:05,680
available and 16A was taken. There had to be some kind of data system that was accounting for all

101
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:10,560
of these types of transactions and after studying a little bit of the information systems in the

102
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:19,920
airlines, realized that there were billions of ticket sales data that actually could be utilized

103
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,000
to understand how the whole world is connected and how people are moving around the planet.

104
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:31,120
So after doing that for 10 years and realizing that there was some rhyme and reason to all of this,

105
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:38,320
um, started thinking more and more about how do we move quickly? In the academic world,

106
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,640
um, you know, when we publish in the scientific literature, it's a pretty lengthy process and it

107
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:51,840
often takes months or, you know, maybe even in some cases even take years to conduct a scientific

108
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:58,800
study, generate the results, submit it for peer review by the scientific community, have that

109
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,000
reviewed if the article is rejected, do it again, if it's accepted, it goes to the editors,

110
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
they review it and so on and so forth. And that's a fairly lengthy process.

111
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,840
Um, but of course, the diseases don't wait for the reviewers to review the science,

112
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:20,160
they spread in hours and days. And so we needed a better system, one that was more agile to be

113
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,520
able to respond to this. And that was for me the motivation for, uh, founding blue dot and creating

114
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:34,560
this as a digital health company. Um, I will clearly say I am not a serial entrepreneur who's

115
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,080
done this 20 times. I had never even imagined creating a company. If someone had said that to me

116
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,760
when I was going through medical school, I would have thought I was some kind of joke,

117
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,640
but ultimately really what I was trying to do was to solve a problem. And, uh, you know,

118
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,000
we have a number of organizations here in Toronto, maybe similar in in in St. Louis or other parts

119
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,080
of the United States that are really here to start supporting, um, an entrepreneurial spirit,

120
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,360
amongst those in the university system to say, well, maybe you can take a leap of faith and maybe

121
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,960
you can accelerate that discovery and scale the implementation of discovery, uh, using business

122
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:18,320
as a vehicle to do that. So, so that was the motivation behind launching blue dot. And what I will

123
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,280
say is that we have been for the last six and a half years building, uh, what we call a global

124
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:32,880
early warning system for infectious diseases. And I'll be happy to, you know, uh, um, to kind of

125
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:40,160
describe what that is and how we use data and things like machine learning and and other types of,

126
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:48,160
analytical approaches and and pieces of technology to build a system that can detect outbreaks,

127
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:52,640
faster than we have in the past, uh, assess how they might spread around the world and what the

128
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:58,400
consequences might be and then actually generate information to disseminate it. So we're literally

129
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,040
spreading insights and knowledge about the disease faster than the disease is spreading itself.

130
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:10,320
So that's really been our overarching, uh, approach, uh, in in terms of how we have been thinking

131
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,840
about infectious diseases, not just big outbreaks like the current coronavirus, but, you know,

132
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,360
we're dealing with the resurgence of measles. We're dealing with, you know,

133
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,880
Lyme disease expanding. We are, we're dealing with a world, unfortunately, a world of infectious

134
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,920
diseases where outbreaks and these threats are becoming more frequent. The outbreaks are becoming

135
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,520
larger and they're having larger and larger and more disruptive consequences. Let's definitely

136
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:44,480
talk a little bit more about how your technology is applied to identifying and warning about the

137
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,040
spread of these diseases. You mentioned that one of the data sets you started looking at was this

138
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,880
airline data. I can imagine how that can tell you a lot about the spread of the disease. A lot

139
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:05,840
more than it would tell you help you identify new outbreaks. Uh, so presumably there are other

140
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:12,560
datasets that you're using and have access to to help with that. Absolutely. Let me break it down

141
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:20,000
into kind of four chunks, if you will. The first thing is surveillance and it's picking up information

142
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,680
about what's happening and what threats may be occurring and those threats could come from

143
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,480
mother nature. They could come from accidents in the lab. They could come from deliberate

144
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,760
acts of terrorism. So there are many different ways that outbreaks it can begin. So I'm going to

145
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,480
come back and I'll take a deeper dive into surveillance and sort of detection of threats.

146
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,520
The second piece is understanding dispersion and, you know, as I mentioned, humans are the vectors

147
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:53,840
that move these diseases around the world now in these, you know, planes that fly all across

148
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:00,560
the planet. We have the ability to travel in ways that are completely unprecedented across the

149
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:08,160
you know, circumnavigate the entire globe in, you know, 24 hours. The third piece after dispersion

150
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:15,040
is impact. What is the impact of a disease spreading from Geography A to Geography B?

151
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:20,640
Does that disease, does that particular microbe of the virus? Does it have the ability to

152
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,640
trigger a new outbreak or is it going to arrive in an area and just fizzle out and disappear?

153
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:31,520
The metaphor I might use there is if you think about outbreaks and infectious disease threats

154
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:39,440
is a bit like a fire. And the fires, you know, have embers flying off them and those embers might

155
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:45,040
land on concrete and fizzle out and nothing happens or they might land on, you know, a pile of dry

156
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,040
leaves and now you got the next fire going on. Outbreaks are really the same. So what we are

157
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,480
using and I'll talk about this are using things like machine learning and AI to detect outbreaks

158
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,560
faster. We are using other data sets on how populations move around the world, including air

159
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:10,400
travel data, including, you know, in large numbers, anonymized data from hundreds of millions

160
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,320
of mobile devices and location data around the world. We're using data from satellites, for example,

161
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:21,600
as well as a whole bunch of other data in real time to understand, does this microbe in this

162
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,640
geography at this time have the ingredients to trigger an outbreak or not? You know, I'm here in

163
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:32,400
Toronto right now in February and it's about minus 20 outside their minus 20 Celsius. So I don't

164
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,680
know what that is in Fahrenheit, but it's pretty darn cold. So if you've got a disease that's

165
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:43,840
spread through a mosquito or a tick, it's not going anywhere right now. But if it was in Singapore

166
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,440
or somewhere else, you know, maybe it's 30 Celsius there right now in humid and so forth,

167
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,080
um, that might be the right environment at the right time for an outbreak to propagate. Got it.

168
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,240
And the fourth piece is ultimately about communication. How do we get information into the hands of

169
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:11,360
people in a way that it does not overwhelm them and is consumable and meaningful to them? So

170
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,200
this is really important. I'll just say a couple words about it is, you know, if we keep sending

171
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,200
everyone information about every thread in the world, you know, we we result with information

172
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,560
overload. We just basically overwhelm people and then they just start to tune it out because it's

173
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,640
not relevant to them. There's a professor at NYU Clay Sharkey is his name and he he sometimes talks

174
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,800
about, um, hey, we shouldn't be talking about information overload. We should be talking about

175
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:46,960
filter failure and so we often think about that. Well, what do I need to know in Toronto that's relevant

176
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:54,080
to me right now? If it's relevant to someone in, uh, in Beijing, well, they should get the information

177
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,560
that's relevant to them. I don't need to know that right now. So I'm going to talk a little bit

178
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:03,600
about that, um, as we sort of go through. But why don't I start out by just describing a little

179
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,120
bit on the surveillance side and how we gather information about, uh, outbreaks and threats?

180
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,040
Please. So one of the things that we learned during the SARS outbreak was that if we rely on

181
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:22,000
government agencies to report information about outbreaks, we may not be getting the information

182
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,760
that we need in the most timely manner. Um, and that is even though there is a treaty called the

183
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:35,360
international health regulations that countries around the world are bound to, um, they, you know,

184
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:41,120
this is a treaty based on goodwill. There's no enforcement. The idea is that if countries have said,

185
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,120
okay, if we're having an unusual outbreak, we're going to report it rapidly to the World Health

186
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,560
Organization. Is there issue more that there's, you know, dysfunction within the information

187
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:57,120
gathering and collecting or more that they, you know, are protecting their interests by not, uh,

188
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,400
communicating about it? It could be a combination of the above and it depends in a country that has

189
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,160
got really limited resources in a weak public health and health care system. It may be that they

190
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,440
don't actually even know what's happening. Um, but as you can imagine in other situations,

191
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:19,120
a country realizes that once it makes a statement about an outbreak that is, uh, serious,

192
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,760
there will inevitably be serious economic consequences that follow.

193
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:30,000
Um, so, you know, it gives, I can understand and appreciate that it would give, uh,

194
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,360
some pause to, you know, reporting. And so that could lead to some delays. And when you're dealing

195
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,080
with an outbreak and putting it out, it's just like a fire. The sooner you know about it, the,

196
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,400
the better the chances are that you can actually extinguish it. So what we learned there was that

197
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,840
we can't rely just on official information coming from governments. And so there has been an

198
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:58,480
entire field that has developed to say, um, to, to really realize that the internet itself

199
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,480
can be an important medium for gathering epidemic intelligence or information about outbreaks

200
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,000
around the world. And it comes through all these different forums, um, local journalists from

201
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,400
around the world sometimes write about things that they're witnessing or hearing in their

202
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,920
own backyard. And it may be that that actually is published even before the government is aware of

203
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:26,080
it or before the government has said anything about it. Um, there are forums that have been developed

204
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,880
for the public health and healthcare community around the world to contribute information about

205
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,760
things that they may be seeing, uh, in their own area. They can do so anonymously. They can provide

206
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:43,760
their information. Um, but all of this information is coming in a very unstructured form. It's in text

207
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,360
and it's in Chinese and Portuguese and Spanish and Russian and Arabic and so forth.

208
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,920
Mm hmm. So if you basically had a human review this, well, first of all, it wouldn't be possible.

209
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:03,040
There's just the amount of information is, is massive. Um, and you'd need a team of 100 people

210
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,600
to be reading in all these languages and kind of filtering through the, is this relevant?

211
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,320
Does this make sense? Does it not? Um, and so one of the things that we did first, you know,

212
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:21,680
at Bludon started doing, um, is building a system that can gather intelligence from all these

213
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,960
disparate sources to gather all the information that is being reported officially by government

214
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,360
agencies around the world, like the CDC, like the World Health Organization, but also organizations

215
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:39,120
that are responsible for animal health, like the World Organization for Animal Health,

216
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,280
Food and Agricultural Organization of the UN, because many of these diseases have their origins

217
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,560
in animals. They start in animals and spill over into human. So, so on one hand, we're gathering

218
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:57,200
all that official information, but then we have developed an engine that is looking for over 150

219
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:03,520
different diseases around the world, plus syndromes like, you know, an unusual pneumonia or a

220
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:10,720
hemorrhagic fever or some other undiagnosed illness. Um, and so we have built an engine that is

221
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:17,680
basically looking at over 100,000 articles online every day in 65 languages looking for outbreaks

222
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:24,400
with involving over 150 diseases and, and it's doing this every 15 minutes 24 hours a day.

223
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:30,720
Does this mean that a disease has to be well defined, uh, in order for you to identify it?

224
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,160
So, there's two ways we do it. One is we actually look at the name of the disease and then there are,

225
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,400
there's the kind of microbiological name of the disease and then there's kind of the lay name of

226
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,960
the disease, you know, and then there are, uh, sometimes syndromes where it's just somebody had a

227
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,880
respiratory syndrome or a pneumonia of unclear origin and we'll talk about that in relation to

228
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,480
this coronavirus. So we've, we've developed a whole taxonomy that actually is kind of mapped out

229
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,880
what all these things are and then we basically kind of have our system scanning all these various

230
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,600
different sources, uh, looking for those key words, um, but as you could, and, uh, and also translating

231
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,680
that information using things like Google translate into English, but as you can imagine, uh, you know,

232
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:25,200
the joke we sometimes use is, I didn't know there was a heavy metal band called anthrax until our

233
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:31,200
system started kind of picking up stuff, but, but that's, that's not, you know, relevant to us.

234
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,360
Right, the very noisy world out there. It is pun, uh, you know, partially intended, I imagine

235
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,640
there, uh, noisy world and, and it's a signal to noise problem, right? So we've got, all right,

236
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,960
well, we have massive haystack, uh, where do we find the needles in the haystack?

237
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:54,000
And so ultimately what we've done is we've used natural language processing and machine learning,

238
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,360
and so on one hand we've had our subject matter experts, our epidemiologists and our physicians

239
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,440
and so forth, classifying this information manually, thousands and thousands and thousands of

240
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:12,800
times, and then ultimately using machine learning and natural language processing to then start to

241
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:18,480
learn and replicate human behavior around, well, look, that's about the heavy metal band anthrax.

242
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:24,240
Let's put that into the category we don't need to know about it or this is about a new antibiotic

243
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,280
or a new vaccine being developed for anthrax. Okay, that's interesting and it's about anthrax,

244
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:35,120
but it's not actually about an outbreak. And then here are, you know, anthrax, uh, outbreak is

245
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,960
happening in Mongolia at this point in time. That's important. So we've done a lot of that classification

246
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:48,320
and ultimately then use machine learning and natural language processing to be able to organize

247
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,240
and structure vast amounts of data that is not really possible for a human to do.

248
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,520
So just to say with respect to this coronavirus outbreak, what happened on December 31st,

249
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,320
I guess when people were perhaps thinking about their plans for, for New Year's Eve and,

250
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:14,400
and, you know, welcoming a new decade, our engine picked up some articles in Chinese early

251
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:20,800
morning, December 31st that talked about a pneumonia and it seemed to be associated with this

252
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:28,080
market where seafood and live animals were sold in Wuhan and that there were 27 cases and it

253
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,800
was a pneumonia without a known cause. Didn't seem to be kind of typical causes you might see

254
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:41,520
for a pneumonia. And so, you know, at that moment, it had translated into English and the machine

255
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:47,200
flagged this as out of these 100,000 or so articles a day generally presents us with about five

256
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:56,240
things to pay attention to. And so we then, so the machine AI and this engine is not supplanting

257
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,200
human decisions, it's augmenting human decisions. So it kind of presents it to us as the subject

258
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,800
matter experts. And then we look at them and have a brief conversation and we said here was,

259
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,960
okay, we don't know that this is actually going to become really big, but it has the same

260
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,720
ingredients as what we saw during the SARS outbreak 17 years ago. Nimonia, unclear origin,

261
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,080
seems to be associated with an animal market. We've seen this before. So let's pay attention to it.

262
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:33,760
So the thing that we did ultimately next is after our team of experts looked at it and then we

263
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,360
just make a decision, does this look plausible or is there something unusual about the story

264
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,840
and we need to corroborate it before we go any further. So it seemed plausible to us.

265
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:51,840
Once we actually put it into our overall, you know, our large repository of data,

266
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,160
this is where GIS comes in. This is like geographic information system. So once the location of

267
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:04,560
Wuhan came in, our team of geographers have developed a system that can identify the locations

268
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:10,960
of nearby airports to see how far away they are, where my travelers go to, which airport would they

269
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:18,160
choose. I won't bore you with all the details of the modeling there. But ultimately to say

270
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:23,360
is that we can assign certain probabilities if people are going to use various airports.

271
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,520
And then we automatically then, within a second, connect to the entire world's ticket sales data

272
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,840
to understand how travelers are moving from that location to destinations all over the world.

273
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:43,120
This analysis or this last step that you're describing isn't based on kind of historical flows,

274
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:49,120
but you're looking at kind of real-time actual tickets out of Wuhan or whatever the closest airport

275
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,520
is to other airports. So there's a combination of data that comes with flights and information

276
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:01,680
on dispersion. And we kind of work with three different types of data. Number one is data

277
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:08,000
on the flight schedules of the actual aircraft in advance. So if you're booking a ticket,

278
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,960
you can book up to a year in advance. So we can see all the flight schedules that are happening.

279
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:21,360
Second is the actual passenger itineraries themselves. But those data come after the passenger has

280
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,840
traveled. And then the airline compiles it. So there is a little bit of a lag and a little bit of

281
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:33,520
a delay there. And then we also work with data that's anonymized. Again, I want to underscore that.

282
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:40,160
But it's about 400 million mobile devices and the locations of the mobile devices. Because we

283
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:46,320
know that not everyone necessarily travels by air, but populations may move across land borders

284
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,960
or in other ways. And so the three different types of data sets allow us to gauge and understand

285
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:00,960
how populations may be moving. So in this instance, what we did was we connected to our flight and

286
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,520
passenger flight itinerary data to see what are the typical flows of travelers from that location

287
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:14,800
and that particular time of year to destinations around the world. We did that and these are also,

288
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:20,240
there are about four billion tickets per year and it's all the various connection points that

289
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,800
doesn't it's not following the aircraft. It's actually following the movements of the travelers

290
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:30,720
through all of the connecting points across this network. So we did that and within a second had

291
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,680
been able to identify all of the final destinations that received the most travelers.

292
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:43,360
And then the last stage that sort of kicks in here was we once we actually have done those

293
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,000
analyses, the places that are receiving the highest volume of travelers are ones that we push a

294
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,240
notification to that gives them a synopsis of what has been reported and what we know about it

295
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,040
at this point in a sense. We're just literally trying to spread the information ahead of the disease

296
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:10,080
so that the health officials in those locations would have an early warning. The healthcare providers

297
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,560
in hospitals could get an early warning and even certain businesses and we tend to work with

298
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:21,040
airlines could also receive notification because again, they're an important stakeholder when it

299
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:27,600
comes to various outbreaks. So that's kind of a bit of a continuum of going from early detection,

300
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:34,080
human verification and assessment, connection to information on the world's air travel,

301
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,240
identifying the destinations that are most at risk and then literally pushing the information

302
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,040
to our clients. And we do that in three real categories. One, are government agencies that work

303
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:52,480
in public health, that work in national defense, national security, and even in agriculture

304
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,800
because many diseases, African swine fever is a good example of a disease that doesn't affect

305
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:05,600
humans but can really have a huge impact on swine and can affect food security and have other

306
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,320
economic consequences. So that's one set of clients in different branches of government.

307
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:16,480
As a physician who is practicing and who gets called down to the emergency room to see patients,

308
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,600
I know what's really important and where we don't really have a robust system today is that

309
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,680
we need to get this intelligence not just to the public health department but to the emergency

310
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:35,600
department because that's where patients go. And we assume that our physicians and nurses and

311
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,240
other frontline healthcare workers are going to be able to recognize diseases that they may have

312
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:51,040
never seen before and maybe never heard of before. But that is a very big ask. It is difficult to

313
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,800
ask your frontline healthcare workers to be able to do that when they've never seen these diseases

314
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:03,920
before. But we rely upon them to do that because we need them to do so so they can protect themselves.

315
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:10,560
So they don't end up getting infected or dying in the line of work that they can better protect

316
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:16,400
their patients. They can prevent outbreaks in hospitals that can paralyze the whole hospital like we

317
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:22,000
saw during SARS and even they can prevent outbreaks from spilling over into the community that could

318
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,760
cripple an entire city. So there's a lot that weighs on just like when we talked about SARS earlier,

319
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,480
Toronto was one place where we had a big outbreak but many of the other places, the cases were

320
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:41,040
quickly identified, isolated and no secondary cases actually happened in those instances.

321
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:46,800
And so it's really important for us to be able to make sure that our healthcare workers have

322
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:52,880
these kinds of insights. Does your system make any attempts to project forward?

323
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:59,600
From today, let's say given what we know about the coronavirus, what's likely to happen

324
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,760
over relatively longer periods of time, weeks, months, that type of thing. I imagine it's

325
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:14,880
difficult to do given you have all different scenarios and interventions taking place, but yeah.

326
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:20,560
Well, let me just say we're not just really focusing on detection. We're focusing on anticipation.

327
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,960
We want to be able to help individuals and organizations anticipate what might happen next.

328
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:32,160
So when I think back to the early detection of the coronavirus on December 31st,

329
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:38,480
we had actually published in the scientific literature the cities that we had identified as being

330
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,440
at greatest risk of spread of this coronavirus. So that if you actually go to the Journal of

331
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,800
Travel Medicine, it was published on January 14th. And what we had actually identified was a lot

332
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,080
of the cities that were the first cities to receive the coronavirus as it spread out of China.

333
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:02,800
Tokyo, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Seoul, Taipei, et cetera. And that list is there

334
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,880
to demonstrate what we had analyzed using our data. So in that case, we are looking forward

335
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:16,960
in trying to project and anticipate. Today, because you highlighted that the situation is so fluid

336
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,960
and it is so rapidly evolving and adapting day to day, you can have thousands of new cases

337
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:33,600
and so this is where we have been working more with these hundreds of millions of mobile device

338
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:40,560
location data that are aggregated, again, anonymized, aggregated, but enabling us to in near

339
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,920
real time understand how populations may be moving around the world so we can better anticipate how

340
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,560
the disease might spread. So we are doing that on an ongoing basis. But it's a bit like,

341
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,080
you know, if you think of weather forecasting, we might get a pretty good chance of understanding

342
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:01,120
what's going to happen tomorrow or the day after. But if we start talking weeks or months ahead,

343
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,680
you know, our precision is not going to be as great because there's an enormous amount of

344
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:12,160
stochasticity and randomness that happens. And so ultimately, what we really tend to do is focus

345
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:19,760
on iterative short-term projections and ones that are adaptive to an evolving situation.

346
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,520
You know, it's rapidly evolving circumstances. So we are always looking ahead and trying to

347
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:32,080
identify and anticipate what some of the next moves might be because ultimately, the health community

348
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:36,960
has a finite amount of resources, health and human resources. And we've got to think about where

349
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,400
we use those resources in the way that has maximum benefit either to prevent the spread of a disease

350
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,240
or failing that at least slow the spread of the disease down.

351
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:53,040
You mentioned that anticipation is one of the things that you're trying to do. Does that

352
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,000
include identifying outbreaks before they happen? Kind of the initial outbreaks before they happen.

353
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:10,560
You know, whether it's conditions that become, you know, ripe for the transfer of a disease

354
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,080
from an animal to humans, that kind of thing. Well, let me just say that in terms of anticipating

355
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:22,240
outbreaks before they happen, there's different levels. There is the anticipating the emergence

356
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,320
of a brand new disease that no one has ever seen before. We do not do that. There are other groups

357
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,160
that are out there in the world cataloging viruses and nature and trying to think about,

358
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,320
well, where might the next outbreak occur of a disease we've never seen before?

359
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:43,920
That's obviously incredibly difficult work and very, very difficult to anticipate.

360
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,160
But what we do is we do anticipate the next place that may experience an outbreak before it has.

361
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:58,480
So let me just give you an example going back to 2016 and the Zika virus outbreak. You might

362
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:05,040
remember that was one of the last big global public health emergencies. And what we had done back

363
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:12,000
in that outbreak was working with a number of some of our academic colleagues. We had mapped out

364
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,640
where Zika virus activity was most likely to be occurring in Brazil. And I want to explain

365
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,800
when I say most likely, why would I say that? Well, when you have a brand new disease emerge

366
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,840
on the scene, you don't typically have a diagnostic test for that because it's a brand new

367
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:37,120
disease and you still have to develop it. So in many cases, when you're dealing with a new disease,

368
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:44,800
you don't actually have the ability to understand where it is. And we see the same situation here

369
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,480
in China. We have some understanding, but there's a lot of information we don't have.

370
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:54,560
So in the case of Zika virus, we had to combine data on the mosquito that transmits Zika virus

371
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,080
on temperature that would identify where the virus was most likely to circulate because the

372
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:06,960
environment was optimal for that transmission to occur. When we did that, we looked at all the

373
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:13,360
locations around those particular areas and how travelers were moving to different parts of the

374
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:19,200
world. This is important because Zika virus is a disease of primates and humans, so the virus

375
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,440
replicates in the human body in the bloodstream. And when a traveler goes to another location,

376
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,120
they infect a mosquito and that mosquito, when the mosquito bites them, the mosquito becomes

377
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:37,040
infected and the mosquito then transmits it onwards. The mosquitoes didn't fly from Brazil to Florida,

378
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,880
for example. It was the people that did and infected the mosquitoes locally. So we had napped that

379
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,960
out in 2016 and published that in the Lancet, which is one of the scientific journals,

380
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:57,440
British scientific journal, in early 2016 and I had identified that Florida was really a place

381
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,280
that looked like it was at high risk of experiencing an outbreak because of the large numbers of

382
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,640
travelers coming from areas of Brazil that were most likely where Zika was circulating because

383
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,600
it had the mosquito that transmits Zika virus because the temperature was optimal for local

384
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:19,760
outbreak and we had done that six months before the outbreak actually appeared in Florida.

385
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:25,120
So that's an example of being able to anticipate something before it actually happens.

386
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,800
The last thing I'll just say about that is there are instances now where we can sometimes

387
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,160
infer based on some of our data and analytics that outbreaks might be happening in places that

388
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:45,600
haven't yet even identified them. So when we see lots of connectivity of travelers between

389
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:52,160
locations where there's an outbreak occurring in one place and not in another and some of those

390
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,360
environments are places that have weak public health systems, they're poor countries, we can

391
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:03,600
sometimes identify or recognize that there's a high risk of an outbreak occurring in that location

392
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:11,120
even if it's not necessarily recognized. So it helps us direct our surveillance on the ground

393
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,280
surveillance activities to places that are at significant risk.

394
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:24,080
There's some criticism of the the approach that you're taking from the perspective of

395
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:30,240
you know the predictions like this are difficult and maybe you got lucky a few times and that

396
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:36,240
you know it's kind of reported very broadly as AI being the solution to you know epidemics,

397
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:43,040
pandemics. You know I'm wondering both if you have any general comments on those types of

398
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:50,240
critiques but more specifically what are the limitations of the approaches that you're bringing to

399
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:57,840
bear on these challenges? Well let me just say that you know we certainly by no means would claim

400
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:04,000
that AI has you know got this problem solved it's just one of the tools in the toolbox that's all

401
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,320
it's just another it's not the the end it's the means to it's a mechanism that we can make sense

402
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:18,400
of data in ways that if we did it manually it would be incredibly labor intensive and really slow

403
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:25,120
and inefficient. You know as I said when it comes to surveillance if we if we did this manually we

404
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:30,640
did 100 people are more doing this around the clock. Well we have four four people and a machine

405
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,480
that managed to do this and we're tracking not every not only you know how this COVID-19 this

406
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,800
coronavirus outbreak is spreading but we're also mapping continuously now all these other 150

407
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:48,080
different diseases around the world. So in the way humans can get distracted a machine doesn't

408
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,200
necessarily have to be distracted. So it is a tool that can help us it doesn't it's not the

409
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,320
solution it doesn't solve every problem. I think the other thing in terms of limitations and

410
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:04,960
it is very important is that you know machine learning requires large amounts of data to then

411
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,920
actually make sense of of this and be able to predict based on observing various outcomes over

412
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:17,520
and over again it requires data that is structured appropriately so the machine can consume it and

413
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,200
develop predictive algorithms. But when we are dealing with these types of infectious disease

414
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:31,920
threats they're often isn't the data is often not there and so we have to use a combination of

415
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,360
approaches. Again this is why I say machine learning and other kind of AI modalities are just

416
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:44,400
in another tool in the toolbox. So we may have to resort to epidemiological approaches in

417
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,600
different types of models versus machine learning models because we don't have hundreds of

418
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:59,760
thousands of observations that we can then use to develop a model. So I think it is I would 100

419
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,840
percent agree it is not the silver bullet this doesn't do everything but it is a powerful tool

420
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:13,520
that allows us to derive insights from vast amounts of data and do so in ways that are far

421
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:19,120
more efficient than humans can do and to allow us to do things in a scalable and timely manner.

422
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,080
Ultimately what we have trained our system due today when it comes to surveillance and we're

423
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,960
exploring many different other applications for machine learning but in this case what we're

424
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:36,080
talking about is processing vast amounts of data that humans couldn't possibly do realistically

425
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:43,040
because we have to sleep and we don't speak 100 languages and but ultimately these are I would

426
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:50,400
describe them as relatively low complexity tasks but they're incredibly high volume and there's

427
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,440
an enormous amount of them so we can just simply train a machine to replicate our judgment we don't

428
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,200
have to give it a set of rules to tell it if this then that we can just basically classify things

429
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,520
over and over again and ultimately have the machine kind of replicate our judgment if you will

430
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,960
about how we classify something and and then ultimately do a whole bunch of other things eliminate

431
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,960
duplicates tell us that these stories are speaking about the same thing you know so that we're

432
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,120
not dealing with a hundred thousand articles we're dealing with five events so there are lots of

433
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:31,920
ways that these types of tools can augment our ability to detect assess and respond to these threats.

434
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,520
Kind of tangentially what have you learned about building an organization that depends on

435
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:46,240
these two highly skilled you know skill sets the physicians and epidemiologists and the

436
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:53,920
data scientists machine learning engineers and getting them to work well together and building

437
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:00,240
systems that kind of capture you know what both are good at. You know it's a really really good point

438
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:06,240
and I'm glad you brought it up I think it tells us a couple of things and you know we've heard this

439
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:13,680
many other times but it really rings true to me that diversity is essential to tackle these

440
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,280
kinds of complex problems and I don't necessarily mean you know ethnic diversity or gender

441
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:25,360
I'm talking about more broadly diversity of mindset the diversity of skills the diversity of

442
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:33,520
perspectives and even the languages that we speak and I don't mean you know in French or Spanish

443
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:40,160
but you know some of our mathematicians will will speak in differential equations as they think

444
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:44,720
through a problem and physicians have their own language and epidemiologists speak another

445
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:51,680
language and what you need is you need to bring people like this together in one place where they

446
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:57,920
can learn from one another and this doesn't happen overnight it happens over years and so you

447
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,840
mentioned I think in our pre-call conversation that you've got even veterinarians on your team.

448
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:09,680
That's correct yeah physicians who practice and specialize in infectious diseases, veterinarians,

449
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:17,280
epidemiologists, ecologists that think about insects and other diseases that affect you know

450
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,600
non-human species we have geographers, a data scientist, engineer, software developers,

451
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:31,120
designers etc and so it is we are a deliberately eclectic group of people with a very diverse set

452
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:37,120
of skills because we can't throw a thousand physicians into the room and solve this problem or

453
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:42,960
a thousand epidemiologists or a thousand data scientists it requires that diversity of skills so

454
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:50,560
that I think is something that is an important and kind of a special feature of this organization

455
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:56,240
and we all operate under one roof so we are not you know working remotely through email

456
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:02,480
we are literally solving problems face to face day in and day out and so six and a half years

457
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:09,840
later we have really learned about each other's perspectives and have become quite good at

458
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,640
integrating these various perspectives to tackle problems in ways that maybe have never been

459
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:22,240
approached before and develop these kinds of solutions it also happens to say is enormously fun

460
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,080
if that's the word I should use just to say just imagine you know people like hackathons

461
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:34,640
we're like one big hackathon you know day in and day out constantly iterating you know

462
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,320
we have an ecologist speaking to a data scientist to a physician to a designer one day and the next

463
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:44,480
day it's a completely different mix because there's another solution or another problem has to be

464
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:52,480
tackled so the amount of peer to peer learning that happens is pretty incredible but also a lot

465
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:59,840
of creativity comes at the intersection of all these different disciplines that you know maybe

466
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:06,000
have never been explored before awesome well Cameron thanks so much for taking the time to chat

467
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,120
with us share a bit about what you're up to and you know frankly educate us a bit on coronavirus

468
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:21,760
and how AI is helping to identify and prevent its dispersion yeah well thank you Sam I appreciate

469
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:32,720
the the opportunity to chat on this forum today so thanks for having me thank you all right
