00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,760
All right, everyone. I am here with Artur Yakimovic. Artur is co-founder at Artificial Intelligence

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:18,720
for Life Sciences and a visiting scientist in the lab for molecular cell biology at University

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,800
College London. Artur, welcome to the Twimal AI podcast. Hello, Sam. It's a pleasure.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,200
It's great to have you on the show and I'm looking forward to our chat. You know, let's get started

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:37,680
with a little bit about your background. You are very active in trying to bring these two streams

6
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:45,680
together, AI and life sciences. You know, what's the origin of that interest? That's a great question.

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:56,400
So, I guess, you know, by my background, essentially, highly interdisciplinary. I did my undergrad

8
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:04,560
in chemistry. Then I decided that I'm very interested to learn where does chemistry stop and biology

9
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:12,400
starts. So I went on to do a PhD in biology and computational biology. And computers and

10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:20,080
computer science was always a great interest for me and I was always thinking about, well, you know,

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,480
we could probably do more and better in biology in general and, you know, spearhead the discovery

12
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:35,760
if we use a little bit more computers there. So after finishing my PhD, I did a short postdoc

13
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:47,520
at University Hospital in Zurich and I was working on in the Department of Microbiology working on

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:56,400
bacteria and computer vision algorithms. And after that, I moved on to do another longer postdoc

15
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,640
University College London. The postdoc I just recently finalized.

16
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:11,680
Okay. Cool. And you said something interesting in there. You wanted to see where chemistry stopped

17
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:20,800
and biology finished and that led you to studying viruses. What's what about viruses kind of

18
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:29,520
characterizes that that edge unlike any other, you know, number of biological processes that are

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,240
also fundamentally chemical? That's a great question, thanks. So in principle, you know, there's

20
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:42,320
a big philosophical discussion where the viruses are dead or alive. I think personally,

21
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,240
and that's that might start a huge conversation in the in the follow-up of the show, but I think

22
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:55,680
I think personally that they are undead. So, absolutely, vampires and zombies in the life.

23
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,920
Well, think about that. Viruses technically are alive only once they are inside of a host cell.

24
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:10,160
So at any time between that, they don't show any signs of being alive. So in that sense,

25
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:18,720
they can be classified as either alive or dead at any time apart from any specific circumstances.

26
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:27,920
But they're different from other compounds, and that once they are inside of a host, they start

27
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,640
to do things that we associate with being alive like... Absolutely....and metabolize and all these other

28
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,520
things. Absolutely. So not like some inert catalyst. Exactly. Yeah. And they are very complex systems

29
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:50,800
that are able to self-replicate and go on with their lives for only that long as the host is alive.

30
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:03,760
And so after... I mentioned your co-founder of an organization, artificial intelligence for

31
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,840
life sciences, it sounds like it's a consortium is probably not the right word, but it's an organization

32
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,440
along those lines and that you're trying to bring folks together and start conversations.

33
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,600
Tell us a little bit more about what you're up to there and your goals.

34
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,720
Yeah, absolutely. Thanks a lot. So the artificial intelligence for life sciences is essentially just

35
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:37,760
a platform bringing together people from life sciences, academics, and anyone who is interested in

36
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:43,120
life sciences in any way, and bringing people... Platform like platform like Facebook or...

37
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:52,160
We use multiple sort of technology platforms, just an organization or platform.

38
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,480
More like an organizational platform. We simply bring people together and provide

39
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:07,200
them with means like a simple forum, an exchange of data, a chat where they can exchange

40
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:13,840
opinions and ask for some technical help or maybe some clarifications and stuff like that.

41
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,400
So our main page if you look at it essentially is a forum where we try to discuss things,

42
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,960
do journal clubs, look at papers, share code, share solutions, and so on.

43
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:34,480
So the organization itself is aimed as a community interest company, a non-for-profit organization.

44
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:41,920
And the core idea behind it is essentially to bridge the massive massive divide that exists

45
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:46,400
between life sciences and computer science or artificial intelligence.

46
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,280
And the divide is constantly growing and as AI progresses, things become more and more

47
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:04,000
difficult to get into. And we're trying to kind of bring the value that advanced AI can give

48
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,320
to life sciences and to scientific discovery.

49
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,920
Why is it that you think that AI gets more difficult to get into for folks in the life sciences?

50
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:24,240
It seems like as the field progresses, different approaches become commoditized,

51
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,640
the tools are becoming commoditized and the barriers to entry in a lot of ways are falling.

52
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:42,000
That certainly is the case. However, let's say many problems that are getting

53
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,400
commoditized are still not the same problems that life sciences is looking on.

54
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:55,360
So, in life sciences, you quite often try to do things in a little bit more of a broader fashion

55
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,640
where you try to bring in several methods showing the same thing. Whereas in computer science,

56
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:07,440
you quite often try to look at the same problem over and over and over again using a variation of

57
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,280
as, you know, like you define those canonical problems like facial recognition and

58
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,520
somatic segmentation and so on and so on. Whereas in life sciences, you're trying to bring all

59
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,640
sorts of different kinds of data, DNA sequencing, bi-imaging electron microscopy, this kind of

60
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:33,840
things in order to kind of show the representative problem from multifaceted view.

61
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,080
So, in this sense, it's a quite a different way of thinking about these problems.

62
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:49,600
And although certain methodologists get more and more commoditized, as they do, so they certainly

63
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:57,760
become less difficult to apply to the same problem and more difficult to apply to new problems.

64
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:08,080
Okay. I've had a number of conversations with folks on the podcast

65
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:19,200
in the life sciences and a lot of them have, well, they've been fairly varied, but a good number

66
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,840
of them have been focused on microscopy data. And I think that aligns with just the point you

67
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,560
are raising that we've made, made so much progress in computer vision recently. Is that one of the

68
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:39,120
the fields or problems that you've been working in? Yeah, absolutely. Definitely, thanks a lot

69
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:47,360
for mentioning it. So the microscopy is and biomedical imaging in general is sort of a

70
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:58,160
pinnacle of the entire quantitative biology and the way it's moving forward. It is one of the most

71
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:06,560
sort of digitalized sources of biological data. And obviously working with images is getting

72
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:15,040
increasingly more and more sort of easier. Like I wouldn't say easier, probably easy is the wrong

73
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:22,560
word. It's getting, you're getting a bigger tool set to work with images every day. And

74
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,680
thanks for getting. Go on to that distinction. So you've certainly got a lot of tools, but hopefully

75
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,240
the impact of all of these new tools is that they make things easier, but you're not quite ready

76
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:42,640
to say that yet. Yeah, I think quite often it's a little bit of that's hidden again on the same

77
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:51,360
point that you raised before, as we progress with things like AutoML and things getting easier and

78
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,320
more commoditized. Suddenly, you don't even know anymore. What is it that you're looking for?

79
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,360
Are you looking for image classifier? Are you looking for a segmentation? And there's awful loads

80
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,360
you need to know about overall image analysis and all this kinds of problem in a history, a problem's

81
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:17,280
history sort of if you will and computer science background to move it to the from the idea or an

82
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:23,920
actual biological problem to a computational problem that is then going to be solvable by those

83
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:33,520
commoditized tools. So we'll come back to kind of some of the broader life sciences,

84
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:41,600
you know, issues, but let's maybe talk a little bit about your particular research interests.

85
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,320
What did you do for your postdoc and what are some of the things that you do in your current role?

86
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:57,680
Right, thanks. So in my postdoc, I worked in combining deep learning with

87
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:06,320
microscopy, quite specifically, super-resolution microscopy of viruses. So virus

88
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:16,800
particles or like one of the tricky things about viruses altogether is that probably one of the

89
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,200
perhaps one of the only thing that they have in common is that they are cold viruses.

90
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,600
They are quite different entities altogether depending on the kind of virus. They may be

91
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,960
comprised of RNA. They may be comprised of DNA. They may be large. They may be small. The

92
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:45,520
size can vary between microns and nanometers. So like probably the smallest one is around 20,

93
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:54,880
30 nanometers. So it's a vast huge field with things being very, very fragmented in multiple subfuelts.

94
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:03,760
So again, that's coming back to the problem of making things more applicable for computer science

95
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,880
methodology, right? If it's certainly not a great idea to have a lot of small data sets rather than

96
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:19,440
one huge data set helping to solve one big problem. So in this, in one of the projects,

97
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:28,000
I worked in several vapors. In one of the projects I've listened to published, we managed to

98
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:35,760
sort of explore the space of a super-resolved virus particles of so-called

99
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,520
vixenia virus. It's a box virus family. What's the virus name?

100
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:46,560
Vixenia virus. It's the virus that was used as a life of a vaccine for eradication of small

101
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:58,720
pox. And in this work, we looked at, we used a set of different relatively advanced,

102
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,440
or let's say, you could say state of the art and neural net architectures for image analysis

103
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:15,120
and image classification to solve a number of day-to-day problems of ourologist phase

104
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:23,600
with their data. For example, if you've got a micrograph of a cell infected by a virus,

105
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,760
how do you tell whether the tiny little dots that look like kind of stars are inside of the

106
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,000
cell or outside of the cell? And that's in three dimensional space. So in a biological sense,

107
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:43,440
what we managed to show is that you can use advanced neural networks to pick

108
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:53,520
these minute signals, alterations that occur once the virus is crossing the cell or membrane,

109
00:13:53,520 --> 00:14:00,240
so that you could tell that from the virus micrographs by themselves. And one of the interesting

110
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:10,560
sort of tricks we managed to use in this case, and that's advocating for

111
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,640
using a deep learning for viruses specifically, is that we've been multiplexing the number

112
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:23,120
of data points through the fact that you would have multiple viruses per one single cell.

113
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:30,320
And since quite often in microscopy, the fixed magnification is way more suitable for

114
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,160
celler size than the virus, single of our size, you get way more virus particles in your

115
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:44,880
data set from one single cell. And that allowed us to use more advanced neural nets. And

116
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:53,280
additionally to that, we developed a trick where we called mimicry embedding, which essentially

117
00:14:53,280 --> 00:15:01,440
repurposed, it's a variation of transfer learning where you simply repurpose things like

118
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:09,360
amnesty by just feeding all this potentially not useful representations from handwritten digits.

119
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:20,320
And it turns out that single channel of a viral core looks very similar if you projected

120
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,000
in a certain way, it looks very similar to a handwritten digit. So data sets are very similar

121
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,560
in this case. And that allowed us to sort of avoid the trap of using very high capacity

122
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:43,760
neural nets on relatively shallow data sets. And just so I'm understanding what you're

123
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:53,760
saying here, are you saying that this single channel super resolution microscopy imagery,

124
00:15:53,760 --> 00:16:02,480
you're able to do some kind of dimensionality reduction or projected into some embedding space

125
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:11,440
and to something that's on the order of an amnest digit in terms of the number of features or

126
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,560
there's actually something that is like the digits themselves about this data set that you're

127
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,040
working with. It's more coincidental in this case and it's just the fact that if you work in

128
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,320
fluorescence microscopy, there's a lot of, you know, tricky technical things that are already done

129
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,760
for you as compared to traditional computer vision. So let's say if you have a normal photograph

130
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:41,360
in computer vision, you would need to mix channels or do some semantic segmentation to avoid

131
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:50,640
to look at the foreground versus background. And since those were problems in the field of

132
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,960
microscopy for a very long time and a long time ago before we had all these powerful computers and

133
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:04,560
methods, there was a rather simple physical solution sort of developed for this computer science

134
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:13,040
problem, if you will, where fluorescence functional microscopy used the system of specific

135
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:22,560
specific color elimination and filters to just filter out the light that is not necessary. So

136
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:29,040
you are end up with just looking at the foreground on the black background. And that is quite

137
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:35,520
an interesting sort of approach and it's very, very commonly used essentially in microscopy

138
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:44,800
fluorescence microscopy. And that's why, you know, when in computer science people quite often

139
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,520
were, you know, trying to develop a very complex solutions to do the segmentations in biology

140
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:59,600
people were just like, oh, we're just used, you know, a binning or thresholding as Nikola to just

141
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:07,120
separate up and down and we're happy we've got our objects here. So that's, it's, there's a

142
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,840
difference in mentality in both fields. And I guess that's what I was alluded to in my previous

143
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:22,880
points. In past conversations, the issues that I tend to hear about that make traditional approaches

144
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:32,640
to like segmentation easy to apply to this microscopy data are things like occlusion where you've

145
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:38,720
got, you know, whatever your target is, say a virus or a cell, depending on your scale, you've got

146
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,040
because you've got these multiple layers, you can have them stacked on each other and things like

147
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:54,160
that is the nature of the problem that you are looking at such that, you know, because the

148
00:18:54,160 --> 00:19:00,960
virus is the virus are so small relative to the cell that you didn't have that those types of

149
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:08,240
occlusion issues to deal with or were you, you know, zooming in to able to kind of isolate the,

150
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,920
you know, the individual virus entities or is there, is there something else happening there?

151
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:21,040
That's a, that's a great question. I'm really glad you asked. So the thing is that in case of

152
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:30,880
viruses, what we had, what we're dealing with quite often is a very, so we are hitting the

153
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,520
so-called diffraction limit of enlightened microscopy. So obviously that would be definitely

154
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,680
small enough to properly resolve the virus. Absolutely. So, and it depends, obviously it depends

155
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:49,280
on the virus you're working in, but the virus I was working in and that particular study was

156
00:19:50,720 --> 00:20:01,440
around 450 nanometers in diameter and that's as close as it gets basically to being slightly

157
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,080
above the diffraction limit, which is about 200 nanometers depending on the wavelength. And

158
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:16,160
basically that allows to exist at this sort of sub-pixel, a little bit of a structure resolution

159
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:26,160
and you would maybe be able to see, to see if you get a brighter particle in case it's a cluster

160
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:32,400
of multiple viruses and not, but it's very difficult to get essentially ground truth for that.

161
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,800
And we're just moving towards this direction. We're at the limit of diffraction, if you will,

162
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,080
in virus-like microscopy. And that's where we need techniques like super-resolution microscopy,

163
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,320
which is not to be confused with super-resolution in AI. It's slightly different.

164
00:20:50,320 --> 00:21:00,800
Right. I'm glad you mentioned that because I was wondering about whether there was a relationship

165
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:08,720
between the two. Super-resolution in AI tends to refer to taking a photo of a given resolution

166
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:15,120
and making a higher resolution, usually a generative version of that. Super-resolution

167
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,040
microscopy is just talking about using very higher resolution microscopes or is there more to it

168
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:30,880
than that? So essentially, in a physical scale, there is no a straightforward way to bypass the

169
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:39,840
or to cross the diffraction limit. And several techniques have been proposed in the past

170
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,560
a few decades that are extremely interesting and extremely successful at the same time. And they

171
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,560
some of them overlap a lot with computational microscopy techniques where you would

172
00:21:54,560 --> 00:22:04,240
essentially try to find sources of information to allow you to cross this limit and compute

173
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:11,920
beyond the diffraction limit. One of sources of such information could be temporal source where

174
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:18,800
you could try to unmix individual point sources by making molecules blank rather than shine at

175
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:28,240
the same time. And another ways to do that would be to temporarily deplete some of the molecules

176
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:35,520
that are shining and make sure that only if you are shining again. But essentially, the trick

177
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,760
of super-resolution microscopy or difficulty of super-resolution microscopy is that

178
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,280
that there is different fundamental information difference between

179
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,080
pixel resolution and spatial resolution. So with the spatial resolution, you're trying to

180
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:03,040
understand if you have one pixel, is this one molecule or two molecules. And with pixel resolution,

181
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:10,960
you can happily create a little bit of structure by doubling the number of pixels and try to do

182
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,520
some prediction there. But essentially, if you don't have enough information on whether it's

183
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:22,080
single molecule or whether it's two molecules or multiple molecules, then you're a little bit in

184
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:25,920
trouble, you don't have enough information. And that's why there are all this clever techniques how to

185
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:38,880
bypass that. Now, I'm trying to resolve all this conversation we're having about the diffraction

186
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:47,520
limit and things like that with these terribly detailed pictures of the, you know, coronavirus

187
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,760
that we're all intimately familiar with now. Is that just a gigantic, massive virus that is easy

188
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,120
to resolve? Or how do we produce these, you know, those images relative to the types of things

189
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:06,240
that we're talking about? So one of the classic techniques, so I would say that that light microscopy,

190
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,080
the stuff that I've been talking about, is relatively fresh in virology and sort of a bread and butter

191
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,040
technique in virology would be electron microscopy. So electron microscopy, by using electrons,

192
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:23,840
rather than photons, you definitely can bypass the diffraction limit. And hence you can get those

193
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:32,400
very detailed images of viruses. But the trouble with electron microscopy in general is that it

194
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:41,840
takes a room-sized device and a days of sample preparation to do some work there. So it's also

195
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:48,080
destructive relative here. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, so you definitely cannot do this life.

196
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,280
So there is a, there is a field in microscopy or in light microscopy called

197
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,880
a life microscopy or a lifestyle microscopy where you just essentially do a video of what's going

198
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:14,000
on the cell with a different temporal resolution. Got it. And so this entire project that you

199
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,560
are working on was interesting from a life sciences perspective because it was allowing you to

200
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:32,240
resolve things at the level of a virus that were kind of at the edge of what you might be able to do

201
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,480
with light microscopes. It's actually not particularly impressive for scanning electron microscopes,

202
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:47,280
but just that's a lot more expensive. And not only that, I mean in terms of let's say differences

203
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,880
in, there are differences in sample preparations, as you said, right? The sample preparation can be

204
00:25:52,880 --> 00:26:09,200
destructive and the entire sort of process of so-called functional microscopy is not as well

205
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:16,400
developed in electron microscopy. By functional microscopy, I mean the situation where you can

206
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:24,160
specifically tag the molecule you're interested in. So in this case, you in fluorescence microscopy,

207
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:31,280
you're able to know specifically like, oh, I, you know, I placed a GFP, which is a green fluorescent

208
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:39,440
protein in the capsid of a virus. So I know that if I'm seeing some green spot, that's probably the

209
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,560
capsid of the virus. And that's what I mean by functional microscopy and that's a whole new different

210
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,320
level of techniques. And I think electron microscopy is trying to get to that level, but it's a

211
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:59,760
way, way trickier. So there's so in addition to to costs and the sample prep, there's also just

212
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,160
stuff that we know how to do with light that we haven't figured out how to do with electrons yet.

213
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:13,040
Absolutely. Okay. Okay. And so is this work that you're referring to the work that was recently

214
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:18,160
accepted in the American Society of Microbiology paper or is this is that different? Yeah, yeah,

215
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:25,920
that's a fresh stuff of the press. Awesome. And so in our, you mentioned that that paper also

216
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:34,720
looked at the application of caps nets, capsule networks to this problem. And I mentioned when

217
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,480
we were chatting earlier that I think this may be the first time I've heard of caps nets being

218
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,000
applied in the wild. Tell us a little bit about your experience using caps nets. Why, why did you

219
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,440
you know, try that route and what kind of results did you see there relative to, you know, CNNs?

220
00:27:51,440 --> 00:28:00,880
Yeah, thanks. Absolutely. So the caps nets, I have to say, they kind of swayed me with the whole

221
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,400
sort of elegance of the idea. So I decided to try them on and just drop some data on it.

222
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,440
And there's not a skirm that the folks are familiar with that, you know, maybe take a second to

223
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:19,920
what specifically swayed you about the idea there and what the idea? Yeah, absolutely. So the idea

224
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:26,800
of having sort of nested representations in capsules and trying to learn the nested representations,

225
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:37,440
I find this somewhat attractive just because you probably would expect some logical connections

226
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:45,120
to be retrieved in such a way. So I decided to try to train a capsule network. And so this

227
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:55,520
turned out to be relatively difficult with absolutely sort of naive architecture without any

228
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:03,840
pre-trading. However, using this trick that I've been talking about before with embedding some

229
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,680
amnesty data and training it together with, or in a transfer learning sort of setting

230
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:19,840
with various data, that helped a lot. And we got pretty good results. Resnets still win,

231
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:26,560
but capsule networks are able to train on even on such wild data, as you mentioned.

232
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,520
Interesting. Yeah, so the way I tend to think about the capsule idea relative to

233
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:42,480
CNNs, and you tell me if this is a horrible explanation or not, is I think of CNNs as being good at

234
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,040
kind of this two-dimensional, translational, invariance, whereas capsule networks are

235
00:29:50,320 --> 00:30:00,160
designed to represent kind of the structure within the thing, the image in multiple

236
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:05,840
and higher dimensions, is that the main thing that you find interesting there?

237
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,280
Yeah, absolutely, yeah. And I think that's there is something in this idea because I just

238
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:20,160
doing some convolutions and then pulling it somehow, although it works remarkably well,

239
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:26,640
and I don't mean to say anything about very clear and basic convolutional networks.

240
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:38,560
However, it seems like there should be something more to that, so I choose a belief.

241
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:52,560
And when it comes to the ultimate results that you saw is the idea and kind of what

242
00:30:52,560 --> 00:31:01,440
is power in your belief in the promise of Capsnets, is it that we with CNNs, and I think you said

243
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:09,280
you use Resnets, like we know how to scale the compute there, and Capsnets, they're newer,

244
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:14,320
maybe we don't know how to scale the compute as well and make networks that are as deep, but

245
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,600
fundamentally, if we could do with Capsnets, what we are able to do now with Resnets,

246
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,120
you would expect it to perform better, is it that kind of thing where we're just kind of catching up

247
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:34,560
in our ability to compute. I'm trying to really get at the thing that you think holds,

248
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,280
you know, holds so much promise given that it isn't working as well.

249
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:50,320
Yeah, so I hope that exactly, as you suggested, if we able to scale the sort of network capacity

250
00:31:50,320 --> 00:32:00,560
required to address certain problems, we'll get to, we'll get them to work a little bit better

251
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:07,440
than they do at the moment. And in principle, maybe it's not the capsule networks in general

252
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,960
that will work out in the end. Maybe it is also some other approach that will build upon this

253
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:21,440
promise that, you know, there's more of a context that we need to try to include in multiple levels

254
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:37,520
at the same time. Is there, is your work touching on kind of this inherent graph, graphical nature of

255
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:44,240
the underlying biological systems at all, is that something that you look at?

256
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,280
Not yet. Unfortunately, we didn't have sort of capacity to look at this aspect, but I certainly

257
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:58,640
think that, you know, there's only that many questions you answer, you can answer with a binary

258
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:04,400
classification problem, right? So there is definitely an necessity to go deeper into representing the

259
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:13,280
knowledge that is contained in the massive bodies of biomedical literature, for example,

260
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:22,320
to try to understand the complexity that we have in the data. I mean, from the point of,

261
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,680
from probably the very first day when I started working with microscopy images, I always perceived

262
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:37,040
it as a sort of an ultimate roach act test, if you will. You get a spot, like a white spot,

263
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:42,320
or a grayscale spot in a black background, and you try to understand what is that thing,

264
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,880
and different people would definitely see different things in the same image. One person would be

265
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,080
like, oh, what is that thing? Oh, somebody told me that's a cell nucleus, and another person

266
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,880
would see chromatin there, and a cell is about to divide, and, you know, there's a lot of

267
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,000
information that depends on the contacts, and depends on your prior knowledge there. So,

268
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:10,080
obviously, as you said, I think incorporating things like knowledge graphs into work like this

269
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:17,360
would be definitely a way forward, and that's something that I see developing in the coming years

270
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:27,520
and the field. And so, maybe using that as an opportunity to zoom back out to AI and life sciences

271
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:36,000
generally, we spend a lot of time talking about microscopy, and that plays a big role in the field.

272
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,680
Are you, has your organization, you know, many new attempts to kind of map out the various ways

273
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:51,440
that AI, you know, can or should impact life sciences, and how far along we are in those various

274
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,000
areas? That will be a thing to go for that we that we have already discussed with my colleagues.

275
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,720
And unfortunately, we hadn't had that much time to do that just yet, but I think in general,

276
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:12,480
you know, going beyond just microscopy and images, looking at the, there's a lot of research

277
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:20,320
going on right now in the field of molecular life sciences in general, looking at the

278
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:27,200
molecular structures or sequences, protein sequences, DNA sequences, and trying to combine it with,

279
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:33,280
you know, basic techniques like, same that is used in the in the fields of natural language

280
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,720
processing, for example, right, where you could try to use some generated approaches, for example,

281
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:48,320
to see, to predict the binding sites and to predict novel confirmations of molecules and so on.

282
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:56,560
So this is definitely a great direction to start getting into. And I guess the way I see the

283
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:05,120
mission for the organization is that we should try to bring the conversation forward to

284
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:12,240
to combining similar to the way that life sciences are structured today. We need to combine

285
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:18,640
multiple sources of information revolving around a single phenomena in order to sort of

286
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:26,800
be able to push the discovery because life's discovery in life sciences is never done as a result

287
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:36,160
of a single sort of method that that shows one thing. You always need to reach out and then try

288
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:44,640
to prove, prove your concepts using multiple methodologies. And yeah, look at things from

289
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:55,440
multiple sites. And is that fundamentally because what where the real insights are in life sciences

290
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,920
when we start to understand function and you don't just kind of see that in a one shot thing,

291
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,920
it's based around a developing body of knowledge that comes from looking at things in different angles.

292
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:13,200
Absolutely. So the thing is that my most discoveries made not because, you know,

293
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:20,480
you see something unusual and that's a discovery. It's quite in contrary, it's a rigorous process of

294
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:29,520
just trying to prove that you made a discovery essentially in multiple ways until you run out of

295
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:40,000
ways to just to prove yourself. So I remember when I stumbled upon a virus inhibitor for which

296
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:48,320
we were published in 2017, it was using biomedical imaging at the time lapse imaging of

297
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:54,720
of a so-called virus plaques. Virus plaques are when you start the infection with one single cell

298
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,960
at Chines Green and then you see that the infection spread into neighboring cells and you get an idea

299
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,520
what's going on with those cells. Are they supporting the infections where I do not? And I couldn't

300
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:13,200
get it to work under certain conditions and it turned out that one of the molecules I was keeping

301
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:20,640
in my medium was preventing it from spreading and that's how you stumbled upon a discovery.

302
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:27,360
But essentially to get from that point to the actual published paper, it took collaboration of

303
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:33,360
multiple people and multiple methodologies to address multiple aspects of what's going on.

304
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:47,680
So what degree are there hobbyist opportunities in life sciences? Do you have to have the

305
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:55,440
backing of a huge lab to not necessarily make interesting discoveries but even play with the

306
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:04,880
data or are there things that folks can do to just start to better understand biology with

307
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,360
the tools that we have in neural networks and the data sets that have been made available.

308
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,280
That's an excellent question, thanks a lot. So actually I believe personally that there are

309
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,680
massive amounts of hobbyist opportunities scattered around the field. There is simply not enough

310
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:32,400
hands in life sciences to get all this advanced methodologies going and doing what they can do best

311
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:41,920
like fostering science, improving the accuracy of assays and so on. So I think that

312
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,400
that's one of the main missions of the organization I'm trying to build. It's to bring together

313
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:57,040
hobbyist researchers from all sorts of fields in order to see, okay, maybe there is an opportunity

314
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,680
to publish paper here and there and maybe there is an opportunity to make advances in biology.

315
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,000
Maybe there is an opportunity to just get some published data and play with it a little bit.

316
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:17,280
So that's one of the goals of this work. And in principle there is really a lot of data sources

317
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:24,960
that maybe not many people know about that they can immediately work with as from a public domain.

318
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,920
And there are a lot of open problems, we just need hands.

319
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:36,320
Awesome, awesome. And so for folks that are interested in taking you up on that, how do they

320
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,120
find you, connect with you, learn more about the opportunities that are out there?

321
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:49,440
Go to ails.institute and join the forum, start conversation, ask a question.

322
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,280
And the idea is that we will connect you with researchers who are actually working at this.

323
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:01,120
Awesome. Awesome. Well, Arter, thanks so much for taking the time to share a bit about what you're up to.

324
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:17,120
Awesome. Thanks a lot. It's a lot of fun. Thank you.
