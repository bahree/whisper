00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:33,800
I'm your host Sam Charrington. In this episode of our Pegaworld series recorded on

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,640
site at the conference in Las Vegas a few weeks ago, I'm joined by Michael Kemper, chief operating

5
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,800
officer, a global share registry and financial services provider, Link Market Services.

6
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,920
In this interview, Michael and I dig into Link's use of workforce intelligence software

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,600
to allow it to track and analyze the performance of its workforce and business processes.

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,160
Michael and I discuss some of the initial challenges associated with implementing this

9
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,000
type of system, including skepticism among employees, and how it ultimately sets the stage

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,600
for Link's broader use of machine learning AI and so-called robotic process automation

11
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,080
to increase workforce productivity. Thanks to Pegasystems for sponsoring this show and

12
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,360
our Pegaworld series. Amidst the discussion of automation and enhanced customer experience

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,320
is that Pegaworld, the company announced several new AI-powered capabilities as part

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,920
of its Pegat Infinity Process Automation Platform. For more information on Pegat Infinity,

15
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:39,360
head over to pegga.com slash infinity. And now on to the show.

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,400
All right, everyone. I am here at Pegaworld and I've got the pleasure of being seated

17
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:52,920
with Michael Kemper. Michael is the chief operating officer of Link Market Services.

18
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,040
Michael, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

19
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,120
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here.

20
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,200
Why don't we get started by having you tell us a little bit about your background and

21
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,640
it sounds like you've been doing some work with machine learning and AI at Link. How

22
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,200
did you kind of come into working with those technologies?

23
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,240
Yeah, thank you for that. It's a great opportunity to really explain how we've been taking

24
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:21,520
AI and we've taken the work with Pegat to very different levels than we've ever had

25
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,160
in the past. So it's probably worth starting with what our industry and what our business

26
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,040
does. So we work with corporates to basically do some outsourcing for them. So we look

27
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,560
after the share registration, employee share plans, some investor relations. So we're

28
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,360
the guys when there's an annual general meeting, where the people who send you the documentation

29
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,880
and allow you to vote at a meeting, pay dividends, if there's a corporate action, those kind

30
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,080
of things. On the employee share side, if there's a launch of an employee share plan, we'll

31
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,120
manage all of that. That industry is a pretty mature industry. It's been around for hundreds

32
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,800
of years and inevitably because of that, it's very product focused, very paper focused,

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,560
very transactional focused. And from time to time, it's very seasonal focused as well. So

34
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,720
an AGM only comes around once a year and they tend to be within the same three month period.

35
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,120
So you can see there are huge spikes in volumes. An annual general meeting. Okay. So when

36
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,880
a PLC once a year engages with their shareholders to say, this is what we want to do for the following

37
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,320
year and that might be reappointing the directors, might be reappointing auditors, might be

38
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,160
taking some strategic decisions around that. So and corporate actions, things like take

39
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,480
over as mergers and acquisitions and those kind of things we do as well. So we realised

40
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,600
as part of this that our industry was relatively manual, relatively paper based with a large number

41
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,000
of handoffs between different parties as we go on. And we knew that a lot of that created

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,800
inefficiency, probably some risk within the business and certainly not the service you

43
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,280
would want to provide to customers and their stakeholders. And one of the things that's

44
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,600
a little bit unique about our businesses are clients are the PLCs, so public limited

45
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:08,920
companies and the corporates, whereas the stakeholders are the shareholders or in the employees.

46
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,160
So whilst we only have, you know, to stay over a thousand clients, we have millions upon

47
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,800
millions of stakeholders who are contacting us to say, I've changed my address. You didn't

48
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,360
pay me a dividend. Oh, yes, you did. Can I have a replacement? All of those kind of things.

49
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,840
So we spent, you know, a bit of time saying, how do we want to work in the industry as we

50
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,720
go forward? And we looked at other industries and how they behaved. What we didn't know

51
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,280
was effectively where to start on that journey. We could have taken the choice that a lot

52
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,760
of organisations, I think, do, which was throw a lot of money at innovation and hope something

53
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:49,040
sticks and hope that that will produce some good benefit. Instead, we decided to really

54
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,360
go down almost to Donald Rumsfeld. Let's find out the unknown unknowns or the known unknowns.

55
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,200
And to do that, we worked with Pega to implement something called workforce intelligence. Now

56
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:04,360
that's a product that sits on everyone's PC and basically takes a screen grab of what

57
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,080
people are doing on a minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day process and allows a very

58
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:15,280
clear analysis of what an individual, what a team, what a department are doing. And that

59
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,960
gave us a huge insight into our current processes, our current ways of working and indeed where

60
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,600
the risks were behind that. Immediately we put that in, we saw a real change in behaviours.

61
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:35,200
So one of the most important parts of that AI journey was the change in employee behaviour.

62
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,640
Initially, they felt that this could be and maybe was a big brother type scenario where

63
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,680
people were looking at their day to day work, whether that would impact them as individuals,

64
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,000
whether that was a management tool to effectively beat them with a stick. In reality, that was

65
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,840
never the intention. The intention was to work with the guys and say, we can see from

66
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,280
this AI and we can see from the reports that it's generating where inefficiencies are,

67
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,680
where an employee is toggling between two different systems to get the right service

68
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,000
for a client or their stakeholder, where we could see there was suddenly a gap in processing

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,040
because they had to go off and do a, you know, bespoke activity before they could carry

70
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,560
on with the end-to-end journey of, of the product that we were trying to put in place at

71
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:22,280
that point. So we created this environment where teams, managers and everyone involved

72
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:29,040
in the process had a real window into the operating process and understanding of what was

73
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,640
going right and probably more importantly, what was going wrong.

74
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:40,640
I've got to imagine that the concerns that the team members might have initially had

75
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:46,240
were really only shifted once you started to actually deliver on that information, take

76
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,960
action on the things you learned via this reporting. What was the, and presumably, you

77
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:57,560
know, built some stuff to do some things in order to, you know, for example, smooth out

78
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,240
a process. What was the timeline, you know, from when you started getting access to

79
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,920
this information and when you're able to actually implement change in the organization?

80
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:12,760
That's exactly right. There was a lot of concern when we first put it in place, not only

81
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,560
from the administrators and the operatives, but also the managers themselves, which is

82
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,600
sometimes people are surprised that I say that. So let me take a couple of examples of

83
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:25,200
that and then I can answer your question in full. So when we first started out on the

84
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,560
journey, we spent a lot of time talking to the teams, training with the teams to explain

85
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,560
what the data would be used for and how we would go down that particular journey. And effectively,

86
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,080
we had a dual strategy, a top-down approach of these are the kind of things we want to

87
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,040
change to make it happen and a bottom-up approach that was going to be led by the employees

88
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:50,800
and their managers. We had effectively four types of people. Those who got it straight

89
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,440
away and said, this is great, you know, really embrace the possibility to look at that data

90
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,520
and challenge themselves. Those who kind of got the idea, but weren't convinced yet and

91
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:04,160
those who were just, this is the worst thing in the world. You could happen to me. This

92
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,960
is, you know, threaten my job. The fourth, which is the surprising one, was the managers.

93
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:14,480
A lot of managers were saying, why are you putting in something that I already know? Why

94
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:19,440
are you telling me how to do my job? And that was the fear factor behind that. But to answer

95
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,240
your question, it was within the first month that we saw the change. With the good teams,

96
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,120
and there were different journeys for different teams in different departments, we saw that

97
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,480
very quickly on their day-to-day hurdles, because every team has a huddle in the morning

98
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:37,640
around a whiteboard to see what's going to be ahead and what's going on. The good teams

99
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,120
were using that data from day one to try and understand why there were differences in

100
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,600
approach between team members, why people were doing things in a different way, why team

101
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,120
member A was getting really good productivity, whereas another team member was not getting

102
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,840
productivity. And they didn't see it as a competition or a threat to each other. They

103
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,960
saw it as a way to really bolster the customer service and really improve quality. So those

104
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,400
teams within the first month were suddenly seeing change.

105
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,760
With the managers in those teams as well, we saw that very quickly, they realised that

106
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,040
the age-old struggle of our managers managing or our managers superdoers was seen through

107
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,440
this data very quickly. And they could understand that actually, they weren't doing their job

108
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,600
in the way that we wanted their roles and responsibilities to be, and they were becoming

109
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,560
superdoers. So very quickly, they were able to work with their teams and say, hold on,

110
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,480
I shouldn't be doing this. Let me pass this down to the right people, which, funny enough,

111
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,680
made everyone happy. The operatives were saying, finally, I'm getting to do my job to its

112
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,720
full extent, the managers were able to manage to do quality assurance and those kind of

113
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,760
things to go from there. But to answer your question, not every team reached that conclusion

114
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:56,280
within the first month, we did, as you rightly surmised, have to put in some changes around

115
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:01,560
that. And those changes were both bottom-up and top-down. So one example of the bottom-up

116
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,800
is we found in one particular team, there were three or four ways of working for a particular

117
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,560
function. So rather than us come in and say, we will change that for you, we actually

118
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,240
implemented something called a power hour, which is a nice consultancy term for, we took

119
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,360
the team away from their desk for an hour, said, here's the problem, there's four different

120
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,920
journeys on this and we can show you the data. Please come back in an hour and tell us

121
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,160
how you want to do this going forward. They went away, went around a whiteboard, came

122
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,800
back, felt very empowered, and said, this is how we want to manage this process going

123
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:41,440
forward. The following day, you already saw the data change. It was incredible in that

124
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,200
type of journey. Other types of things did require change from us. So we've implemented

125
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,240
something called a process defect log, which is from the data from the WFI, we're able

126
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,120
to see where a process is inefficient. And just like you would have a code defect log,

127
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,320
we're now monitoring those and saying, we will help you change those processes. Some

128
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,840
can be very quick. It's some very simple feeds of data to different systems. Some take

129
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,840
rather longer. And we've been using that to then implement the Pegasystem more universally

130
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:20,480
to say, we now know what processes are fantastic. We know which ones are okay, and we know

131
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,960
which ones need some attention because they're pretty broken. And the business case and

132
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:30,760
the benefits from looking at those individual processes has allowed us to do that top-down

133
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,000
approach and put pegger in place in a way that I think if you'd been scattergun, you

134
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,040
wouldn't have got the same benefits that this is clearly shown as where to look and where

135
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:46,840
to do the right work. This workforce intelligence product, WFI, is kind of capturing user screen

136
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:55,280
activity. And then is it automatically categorizing that or providing some higher level analytics

137
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:02,000
on top of that, or does that go back to some team or staff that you have that is kind

138
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,280
of manually reviewing that and trying to determine the patterns of use and these things that

139
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:12,680
you turn into power hours and things like that? A bit of both. Inevitably in these kind

140
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,560
of things. So the one thing it does very well is turn us an awful lot of data. But before

141
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,960
that happens. Such as. Let me explain. So before that happens, we had to categorize

142
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:27,880
what we felt was productive versus what was non-productive. So we have our own internal

143
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,400
operating systems as everyone does, but we also use the ubiquitous in Microsoft tools

144
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,240
and everything else. Some people would see, say, email Microsoft Outlook as a productive

145
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,200
tool. Some people don't. So when you're sending it up for the first time, there is a choice

146
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,920
for you as a company to say, I believe these products are productive. These systems

147
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,520
are productive. These ones are non-productive. And obviously you then categorize non-work

148
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:56,200
as well, you know, around those kind of things. Now you will never have 100% productivity

149
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,480
because you always want staff to be trained. You always want employees to have a break.

150
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,560
You always want those kind of things, but you set your own targets behind that. Once

151
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,040
you set it up, the system is fantastic at giving you an analysis to say within those productive

152
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,640
or non-productive areas, this is what you're seeing. So give you an example of a tool that

153
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:22,960
we said was productive, which was Microsoft Outlook. We hadn't realized, probably we realized

154
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:27,720
but maybe not to the extent of how it was being used within operations. So we knew it was

155
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,240
used. We used part of our end-to-end process, but in some departments and not all, it was

156
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:40,120
up to 25% of the day-to-day activity within a team. So WFI gave a very quick insight to

157
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,000
that. The no part of that is we've then got to take the choices of how we're going to change

158
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,560
that and how we look going forward. The other argument within that was WFI also shows us

159
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:58,120
when employees are going between two systems. So you can break down very quickly that say

160
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,440
you're going between the operational system, an Excel or Word or something like that or

161
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,280
different operational systems, and it shows you very quickly how often that's happening.

162
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:13,960
And by just seeing that and by seeing the frequency drive certain behaviors and certain

163
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,760
activity that you want to do as managers to change that behavior, because clearly every

164
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,280
time you go between a system, there's a few seconds lost or some frequency of marginal

165
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,400
risk or there's friction exactly behind that. And then of course, you can then compare

166
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,280
teams and employees and see the different behaviors that are going on, which is then

167
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:36,160
allow us to go back to the power hours and those kind of things to go from there.

168
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,440
It sounds like a really interesting tool for allowing you to understand, you know, there's

169
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,080
like theoretical understanding of your processes and then what's actually happening on the

170
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:49,680
ground. And it sounds like it enables that. When you think about this tool and the way

171
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,760
you've deployed it, what strikes you as kind of most AI or machine learning in, you know,

172
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,200
the tool or your use of it?

173
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:04,320
It's a great question. And I think it's really about dragging the assumptions that we had

174
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,960
from the past into touch. Now that's, you may argue that's not true AI, but it really

175
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:16,160
is providing an automated and a very real time feed and a window into our operating system.

176
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,360
So I mentioned before the comparison of the ways people are working. And that is a true

177
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,960
part of the AI. And the machine does make suggestions of where to look and saying we

178
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:32,800
have noticed across the different areas. There's some big differences between behaviors.

179
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:39,040
And within there is a tool that allows you to say, these are the areas you want to target

180
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,560
to them make change. And what it also does, I guess, and it gives you the leap of face

181
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,520
towards more AI going forward. So whilst it shows you the first step, you can then obviously

182
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:56,160
go into other parts of the Pega portfolio to say, actually, I'm now going to take machine

183
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,320
learning into that from this base tool. So it takes you to a certain point. It tip

184
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,600
toes into a bit of machine learning, but actually to do that properly, you then probably take

185
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:12,320
some other Pega tools to go from the status quo to the future state.

186
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,960
Okay. So there's a, it sounds like an underlying belief that you can't automate what you can't

187
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:25,280
really understand. So this will help you understand, again, your processes on the ground and

188
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:32,040
providing on ramp to further automation. That's right. And I think a lot of us will be

189
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:39,840
very familiar with people talking blockchain, workflow, AI, data, and those are solutions.

190
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:46,760
Now what we often hear is, you must invest in, put one of those names in there. You must

191
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:51,600
do this. You must do that. The question we should always ask ourselves is, why? What benefit

192
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,800
is that actually going to produce, whether that's a benefit to an employee, whether that's

193
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,880
a benefit to a customer, whatever that particular benefit is. What this tool has done is change

194
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,880
the power, if you like, from the people who are saying, you must, you must, you must,

195
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:11,520
to the actual people who are providing the service to say, what we need is, now what we need

196
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,920
is to solve an issue, create quality, remove risk, whatever that might be. And so it gives

197
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:26,040
you that step to then say, this is the requirement. Therefore, now go and implement whatever the

198
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:33,480
solution is. So it's really creating an automated requirements process for one to a bit of

199
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:38,480
expression that you never had in the past. And it does go back to exactly what you said.

200
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,240
You may have assumed you may have known some of this stuff, but you didn't really know.

201
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,360
And it's provided a very automated way to say, this is where your problem is. And this

202
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,640
is the benefit you will get if you fix it. Because that's the other part of the tool that

203
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:58,480
really is clear. If you can change your productivity from 50% to 60%, in terms of number of man hours

204
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,520
per year, that is enormous. And that rights its business case, by itself, without any

205
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,760
particular need for a challenge, because the facts are there. And then you pick the right

206
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,600
solution for that, whether that be workflow, whether that be a data hub, whether it be whatever

207
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,920
it might be to resolve that particular issue.

208
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:23,360
I imagine that you had some visibility into individual employee productivity going into

209
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,200
this process. You had to have a sense of, you know, these are your A players, they process

210
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:37,200
3x the volume of some other employees. But you've mentioned several times that it gives

211
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,040
you kind of visibility into that productivity. When you say that is it, again, kind of going

212
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:48,240
back to this understanding of like the why of the productivity or their aspects of productivity

213
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,760
that weren't readily apparent to you before you had this visibility?

214
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,120
Both. So the why is very important. And no one comes to well. Very few people come to

215
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,520
work wanting to do a bad job. Yeah, everyone wants to do the best of their ability. Sometimes

216
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,280
when people aren't as productive, people jump to conclusions that it's around the capabilities

217
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:14,840
of that person, it's their attitude, whatever it might be. The reality is sometimes it

218
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,960
might be we have set up that employee not to be as productive as the person sitting next

219
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,840
to them because we may not have given them the same tools to do the job, the same training,

220
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:28,840
the same experience and all of those kind of things to do that. So WFI allows you to see

221
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:33,600
what they are doing differently to that person who is very productive. Is that an experience

222
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,520
thing? Is that the way they are working? Do they need different training, different coaching,

223
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,040
whatever it might be? And by investing in that, we've seen a real uptick in exactly what

224
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:46,960
you were just mentioning the performance in certain individuals where historically you

225
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,560
might have said, I need to put them on a performance improvement plan for all the

226
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:56,040
wrong reasons. This now provides an improvement plan that is for all the right reasons and

227
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:04,680
we're seeing real benefits behind that. So that in itself is being super helpful. The

228
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,200
other side of that is it's provided employees that self-help. They can actually now turn

229
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,520
around because they see the data as much as anyone else and say, I am struggling because

230
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,000
of, please come and help me, please come and put in some change and those solutions

231
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,040
I was talking about a second ago to make sure that not only is there, process more efficient,

232
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:29,440
but we give better quality to clients, etc. So we've talked about this insight, this

233
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,360
visibility as kind of the on ramp to true machine learning and AI. How far are you along

234
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
that path?

235
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:42,480
Yes, it's a great question. So we only put WFI in January 2017, 18 months or so ago.

236
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,000
And we saw a huge change in the first six to 12 months and now inevitably it's beginning

237
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,040
to level out a bit. But what it did do, as you rightly surmised, is give us the opportunity

238
00:20:53,040 --> 00:21:00,760
to say, and now what? Now let's do the top down stuff. And we've implemented one layer

239
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,800
of our next steps, but we're about to introduce the second, which is really the bit you're

240
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,000
probably going to be interested in. So the first layer we put in place was we re-looked

241
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,680
at the way clients contact us in terms of paper form. And we've used the Pega system

242
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,760
to digitalise our postroom and start putting a very, very automated process in place, which

243
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,520
isn't true machine learning at this point. What we're also doing, though, is the second

244
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:32,560
part of how our stakeholders contact with us. So paper is one, call centres are another.

245
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:42,040
And we're starting to implement the call centre module out of Pega to really understand

246
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:46,320
not only how our process is on the call centre, but to start doing machine learning. So we

247
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,240
are already starting to see, in our proof of concept, the pop-ups on the machine to

248
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,440
say, based on the first part of this conversation, we're expecting to see this kind of

249
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:00,080
behaviour. These are the answers you need to give, and really helping our opportunities

250
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,960
give a better service to the people who call up. And that's the bit that starts to excite

251
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:10,920
me. From there, if that works, we're going to start introducing the robotic webchat around

252
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,480
things where instead of just having a call centre, we move away from the traditional

253
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:19,960
webchat, which is actually just two people emailing each other and calling it a webchat,

254
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:26,160
to a machine learned way of doing things where very quickly we can see people's behaviours

255
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,880
putting the key words and start learning about how to either answer their questions or take

256
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,440
them to the right page on our web portal, talk them through, or machine talk them through

257
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:42,960
a process, so there's a lot more self-help. And we've seen in other industries that self-services

258
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,000
is the way people want to go, and to have machine learning do that is really important.

259
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:54,360
Yeah, I've spoken before at conferences about, we have a lot to learn from other industries,

260
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,280
and the travel industry is a great example. I'm old enough to remember the booklets of

261
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,840
tickets where you ripped them out as you went through the airport. They went through a process

262
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:09,560
of self-service where they put all the cost onto us as travelers, and we thank them for

263
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:13,320
it. I don't want to do that. I don't want to put cost onto someone else, but I do want

264
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:18,840
to provide a self-service process where machines pay apart to that, to those people who want

265
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:24,240
it. Our business is one where the demographics are, some people embrace that massively. That's

266
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,880
their expectations. Some of our other demographics probably aren't ready for that yet. So we always

267
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,760
have to provide the two options, whether that be machine learning contact or pick up the phone

268
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,360
and speak to someone, but in the background, we've got machine learning helping those people

269
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:46,320
give the right service. Yeah, that was a big theme in the key notes this morning, and across

270
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:54,160
the industry really is the continued consumerization of IT, if you will, meaning people's expectations

271
00:23:54,160 --> 00:24:02,080
have risen to the level of what they experience every day via their phone and the consumer offerings,

272
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,680
and now as businesses, we're expected to deliver on that. Yeah, and we've seen technology jumps,

273
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:15,200
too. So we have all demographics who hold shares. The older generation often are cited as people

274
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,760
who they want paper, they want to do things in a certain way, but that's just not true. We see

275
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,280
that whilst they didn't like PCs and laptops, a lot of more on their tablets and their phones,

276
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:30,480
FaceTiming, the children, booking holidays and everything else. So one of the things in terms of

277
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:36,080
how we use machines is to link into the expectations of those different demographics,

278
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:43,040
and you are right, we're seeing people expect things to happen immediately. If they wait 30 seconds

279
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:48,560
for someone to pick up the phone, they get frustrated. Whereas a couple of years ago, no one cared.

280
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,920
Right. Equally, when they do a web chat to use their previous example, waiting for someone to

281
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,680
answer is no longer acceptable. You want an immediate answer. So depending on those stakeholders

282
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:05,440
and how they engage, machine learning and machine interaction is becoming more and more important

283
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:13,360
for those particular stakeholder groups and their expectations. So in continuing down this path

284
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:21,520
towards incorporating more machine learning, more AI into your operations, on the one hand,

285
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,200
you're absorbing a lot of technology and expertise via the vendor relationship,

286
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:36,160
but I'm curious as well, what kind of, what you've had to do internally in terms of skills,

287
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,200
competencies, development efforts, things like that in order to fully embrace this.

288
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,480
Yes. Yeah, it's a great question. I think you're right. You have different stakeholder groups

289
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,280
who move in a different way. So clients and their stakeholders we've talked about, and it's

290
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:57,040
a different journey. Internally, we have had to invest. So even though I talk about the top down

291
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:03,680
and the bottom up, ultimately that is a business transformation type role. And everyone is very busy,

292
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,760
and it's quite a difficult thing to get the operational teams who are the day-to-day running

293
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,640
in operations to think in a much more strategic leadership way to embrace those kind of things.

294
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,560
So we did invest in a central team, as Natalie, known as the business transformation

295
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,840
and service excellence team, you know, took us a long time to come up with that title, obviously.

296
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,520
And their job was not to sit centrally and create ideas, but to really get out into the

297
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,640
business teams, sit with the teams, understand what was going on, and start training them in

298
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,040
different ways of working. So we have a group of core routines that we've embedded into the

299
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:46,560
business, which, yeah, I'll link to the Six Sigma type of activities, but it's the daily

300
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,960
huddles to understand what's going on to utilize the MI moving forward. They challenged people

301
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,120
around what is your daily MI that you would normally have and look at, and is that really fit

302
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,480
for purpose? And how can we use machine learning to change that kind of behavior and move things forward?

303
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,160
So really simple example on the call center. You know, some of the MI we had in the past was

304
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:16,320
useful, but what it didn't tell me was how many times did you call? You know, what was your tone

305
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:22,320
when you called back the last time? You know, were you relaxed, frustrated, and machine learning can

306
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,040
pick up some of that stuff and give different data? Did you call in with you saying,

307
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:31,200
that's great, thank you, you've answered my question, or did it end up with you writing a complaint?

308
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,480
So bringing all of those pieces together and that central team really joining up the different

309
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,600
departments to do things in a consistent way and use that data and learning consistently

310
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,720
was an investment we had to make. Of course, some of those people are trained in change,

311
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,720
you know, the Six Sigma type activity, but what we didn't want to do, as I already said, is sit

312
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,120
those guys centrally and they sit in their ivory tower telling people what to do. Yeah,

313
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,120
once they come together and make sure things are consistent, they are embedded in the business

314
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,840
as part of the local teams. And did they, did you build that team with pre-existing experience

315
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,680
around machine learning technologies and what, you know, what's possible, what's not possible there,

316
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:20,720
or did you train them in those types of things? Combination. So some of the team were

317
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:27,200
brought in because they were experts in change. Okay. Yeah, around looking at operating models

318
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,960
and saying, how do we want to do things differently and go from there? Some of those people are experts

319
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,320
in technology. So fun enough, we do have, you know, one young lady who actually used to work for

320
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,280
PEGA. Yeah, here is a business process architect, but she understands that machine learning very,

321
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,880
very well. It does a lot of work in robotics and can bring that flavor. So like all teams,

322
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,520
you need diversity. Yeah, as I'm in America, I talk about American football and American football

323
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,400
team with only quarterbacks, doesn't work. Yeah. So it's the same with our transformation team. We

324
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,640
need, you know, people who can do analysis, people who can do end-to-end processing analysis,

325
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,360
people who can look at change, people who can implement that change, and of course, people who

326
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,640
understand robotics, AI, machine learning, et cetera. Yeah. Part of what I'm finding interesting

327
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:20,720
in this conversation is I talk to a lot of folks that are building data science teams and trying

328
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,840
to understand or think through how to structure those. Do we centralize them? Do we decentralize

329
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:35,520
them? And it strikes me as, it strikes me that a lot of companies are figuring the same things out

330
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,960
or have figured the same things out as regards to other change initiatives, whether it's digital

331
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,280
transformation or ERP before that or something else before that. It's not just technology,

332
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:55,680
technology, process, people, all these things together, and a balance of the folks that I've

333
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:02,960
talked to that are most sophisticated about bringing data science to an organization,

334
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,840
kind of start the conversation with, you know, it's about culture and it's about people and it's

335
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,720
about building and understanding of what's possible. And, you know, then there are different

336
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,520
approaches to, you know, which problems you buy it off and how you manage the portfolio,

337
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,040
but it strikes me that that, you know, that central piece around, you know, again,

338
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:29,280
people process culture, it's critical. You're exactly right. And I think if you start from the,

339
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:35,440
we want to introduce machine learning, you'll fail. Yeah. If you start from what am I trying to

340
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,880
achieve? And generally, you know, it's a small list. It's normally increased quality, reduced risk,

341
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,240
potentially increased margin if your company's, you know, pushing it that it's probably,

342
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,640
it should be, not always, employee well-being and making sure people have got the tools to do

343
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:55,520
their job and, you know, are happy in their jobs because that creates productivity and in itself

344
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,480
will increase margin. It's starting with those and understanding what you want to achieve.

345
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:06,320
You know, is it saying I want to get rid of incidents, complaints, high quality, whatever it might

346
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,840
be? And then that will lead you to exactly what you said, process culture, technology, technology

347
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,040
is one of the tools you will put that right with. There are others. Yeah. Some of that's around

348
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:22,480
the structure of your business. Yeah. Are you set up in a way that, you know, talk, say,

349
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,280
spans and layers within your business? Yeah. How many deep is your operational structure?

350
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:32,480
Is that efficient? Nothing to do with technology, but it does provide a very different structure

351
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,240
for employee well-being and how they feel and career paths and everything else associated with that.

352
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,480
Technology is just another element of that. And yeah, as I said, if you start with that,

353
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,320
I strongly believe you'll fail. You've got to have a real reason for putting that in place

354
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,800
and understanding what's going on. And it will constantly change. Yeah. I remember I'm

355
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:57,120
sadly old enough to remember the debate around whether you have Excel or Lotus 123.

356
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,640
Yeah. And today, I'm sorry, then that was a big question. Do we want to implement these things?

357
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,600
Now, you find a business that doesn't think Excel is part and parcel of what you have.

358
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:13,360
So some of the things we're talking about today in 10 years time, people will go,

359
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,720
why are you even asking that question? That is just the nature of our job. And as we see,

360
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,480
the change in employees, it's going to be really, really interesting because as you said,

361
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,880
technology is changing incredibly fast. Some employees are still questioning some of this stuff,

362
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:35,040
and are very wedded to certain ways of working. Graduates coming through are saying, why using email?

363
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,680
Yeah, I don't use email anymore. It's all messaging. So we are seeing this technology change not

364
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:47,920
just with our clients, but internally as well. And again, as I said already said, using that technology

365
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:54,720
to deliver the benefits and the things you want as part of your target operating model is key.

366
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,960
But you've got to understand why. What are you trying to achieve? What are your objectives?

367
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,000
Putting something in for putting it in just will not work.

368
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:11,680
And so, I want to ask how you articulate the vision for AI and machine learning

369
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,200
with the broader stakeholders in your organization. But I'm wondering if the vision for AI and

370
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,280
machine learning even includes talking about machine learning and AI at the level that you're

371
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,720
operating? It very much does. So as part of our target operating model, we regularly do stand-ups

372
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,920
to all of our employees, whether that's in small groups as teams or whether we do big town hall

373
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:38,720
type structures. And we tend to focus on a different subject each time. So it might be people in

374
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:45,040
culture, one quarter, it might be technology another. And as part of that technology, some of the

375
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:51,440
debates are actually great. Again, the different employees who have different feelings towards this

376
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,240
are really discussing and saying, how do we want to do this? How do we want to move it forward?

377
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,680
To the other end of people who are very scared of it still. There is still an expectation sometimes

378
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:06,640
that machine learning means a reduction in roles. It really doesn't. It actually means

379
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,400
creating those roles and giving the employees the chance to do their job properly

380
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:18,800
and really change the way they are performing to provide what we all want to do. Everyone wants to

381
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,640
provide the best quality to their clients. Machine learning allows you to do that and it's just

382
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,560
having those conversations and bringing people on. I can guarantee you that if I sat centrally

383
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:37,040
and just put an edict and says, we are now going to do X, there'd be uproar. Communication is key

384
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:42,480
on all of this stuff and I would be incredibly arrogant if I thought I knew everything about

385
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,520
machine learning sitting centrally. Actually, the guys who are doing the job day-to-day

386
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:52,560
every moment of the day are the ones who really benefit and really want it because they see the

387
00:34:52,560 --> 00:35:00,000
true benefit immediately. So it is going back to that communication piece working together

388
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,560
in not just his employees, but as a board to say, where do we want to do this? So we started on

389
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,320
the operational side, but of course machine learning will come on the cell side as well,

390
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,440
come on our dealing side so we do some shared dealing. Machine learning is going to be able to tell

391
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,440
us when the peaks are going to be, how people are going to behave in certain market changes.

392
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,880
We live in a very, very unstable world at the moment. It will be great as we move down this

393
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,040
AI journey and this machine learning journey to be able to predict better how people are going

394
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,320
to behave in certain circumstances. I really appreciate you taking the time to kind of walk us

395
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,960
through the way you're approaching this. It sounds like you've got a kind of an interesting

396
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,960
set of plans ahead of you. No, thank you. It's been my absolute pleasure and I think,

397
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,760
hopefully you've got a taste of the fact that at the end of the day, our employee wellbeing

398
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,720
and our client's quality is at the heart of everything we do. Machine learning and what we've

399
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,960
used so far with WFI and with PEGA is really starting to make a difference in that scenario.

400
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,120
And we're at the beginning. We've got a long way to go in that. We know that, but it's been an

401
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:07,920
exciting start. There's a lot more to do, but hopefully I've given you a flavour of that today of

402
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,280
where we started and where we're going to. Absolutely. Thank you, Michael. Thank you.

403
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,600
All right, everyone. That's our show for today. For more information on Michael or any of the
