00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,200
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

2
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,320
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:33,800
I'm your host Sam Charrington. Perhaps especially appropriate given that much of the globe

4
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,440
is glued to the world cup at the moment, we're excited to kick off this week a series of

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:45,400
shows on AI and sports. While I'm not personally the biggest sports fan, my producer Amari is

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,240
a huge sports follower and this series has been something he's wanted to see since we started

7
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:56,720
working together. So if you like these shows, be sure to hit him up on Twitter at at Twimble

8
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:04,480
underscore Amari, I am AI. Before we get into the show, a quick update about July's Twimble

9
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:11,120
online meetup. On July 17th at 5 p.m. Pacific time, Nick Teague will lead a discussion on the

10
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:17,880
paper Quantum Machine Learning by Jacob Biamonte at all. The paper explores how to devise

11
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,480
and implement concrete quantum software for accomplishing machine learning tasks. If

12
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:30,360
you haven't joined our meetup yet, visit twimbleai.com slash meetup to sign up. Also, be sure

13
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:35,360
to sign up for our weekly newsletter. I recently shared a write up detailing the machine learning

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,440
and AI job board we're working on and got a ton of encouragement and interest. To make

15
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:48,840
sure you don't miss anything, head over to twimbleai.com slash newsletter. In this episode, I'm joined

16
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,560
by Shanade Flahive, data scientist at Dublin, Ireland based Kittman Labs. Shanade joined me to

17
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,760
discuss Kittman's athlete optimization system, which allows sports trainers and coaches to

18
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:07,880
collect and analyze data for player performance optimization and injury reduction. In our conversation,

19
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,080
we take a look at the different ways this data is collected and analyzed and the various modeling

20
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,480
techniques Shanade and her team use to create player insights for coaches and trainers. Shanade also

21
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,840
shares her view of the data driven sports landscape and how it's evolving. Enjoy.

22
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,720
All right, everyone. I am on the line with Shanade Flahive. Shanade is a data scientist with

23
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,640
Kittman Labs based in Dublin, Ireland. Shanade, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

24
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,280
Hi, Sam. Thanks for having me. I delighted to be here. Let's get started by having you tell us

25
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,360
a little bit about your background and how you got started and interested in data science and machine

26
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:57,080
learning. Yes, so I took not a direct route into the data science area. I initially studied

27
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,240
financial mathematics and actuarial science in my undergraduate towards the end of the

28
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:11,640
undergraduate. I was more interested in more statistical type-based modules and my university was

29
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:18,040
very accommodating and allowed me to kind of change the traditional modules that I should have

30
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,920
been sitting and I ended up doing more statistics modules than traditional. So while my undergrad

31
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,040
degree is financial maths and actuary, I traditionally probably have more of a statistics degree.

32
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:37,320
So I began working straight out of university for a statistical analysis consulting company

33
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:45,320
where I was doing statistical analysis and using software and for consulting, doing lots of

34
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:51,320
projects across lots of different areas and I was really enjoying it and I liked the variety and

35
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,160
the different types of data sets that I was working with. So I continued on myself and did a

36
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:02,280
masters in business analytics. So that steers me more towards the data science role. So that position

37
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,200
I grew into more of a data science role there in terms of the manipulation of data, performing

38
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:15,160
more analysis into deployment of models going forward. So when I moved on from that position,

39
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:21,160
one of the things that struck me was I was very much more enthusiastic about working with data sets

40
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,760
that were interesting. So there's an abundance of data out there as we all know and it's growing

41
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:33,640
very regularly. That I was more enthusiastic and excited about data sets that I had a passion for

42
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:40,200
and I would be quite a keen sports fan myself. So when the opportunity came to work with a sports

43
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:46,760
data set as I get to do daily now and in Kidman Labs where I'm working, that I jumped at the

44
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,600
opportunity. So that was how I got into working in data science at sport is kind of combining two

45
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:57,720
key passions of mine, the data science side of it and getting to work with a really interesting

46
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,280
data set as well. Oh, very nice. What are your favorite sports? I would be a keen rugby union fan.

47
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,840
Okay. And so in Ireland we've been we're quite successful in rugby union. We recently won a

48
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:17,640
national competition where we play our closest competitors called the Six Nations and the Irish

49
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,880
rugby team who are one of our customers here in Kidman Labs won that outright. So they beat

50
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,520
every other team and we were involved in that and contributed in some small way I like to think.

51
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:33,080
Awesome. Yeah. And in Ireland then we have our national sports. So they're amateur sports. So

52
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,480
there's Gaelic football and hurling which is quite a it's kind of like hockey but at a much faster

53
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,760
pace that we have here in Ireland. So they would be kind of my own sporting. I don't play any of them

54
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:53,560
mind you to follow and to keep up with. Awesome. And so what does Kidman Labs do and what's

55
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,080
its role in the sporting arena? Yeah. So here at Kidman Labs we have developed an athlete

56
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:05,000
optimization system. So our athlete optimization system enables training and medical staff

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,440
for elite sports teams teams to collect and analyze their data in that way they can optimize

58
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,520
performance and they can reduce the risk of injury because we collect electronic medical

59
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:25,240
medical records from our teams as well. So as we have Kidman Labs have a dashboard that

60
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,760
allows the practitioners to look at the current status of all of their athletes based on their own

61
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:37,640
data collected in their systems. So we have certain ways that data is ingested into our system.

62
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:43,240
So we have we have our own app that athletes can enter in different things on so kind of subjective

63
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,360
measures. How are they feeling? How did they sleep last night? Do they have any muscle soreness?

64
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,520
We also have as I mentioned the electronic medical record system where the medical staff in the

65
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,800
the clubs would enter injuries when they occurred where in the body they are. So that gives us

66
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:07,000
a lot a lot of information on the injuries. We also allow the practitioners to impose other

67
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:14,200
kind of objective tests. So if an athlete was doing a screening it's what we tend to call it.

68
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:19,800
They would do things like check their hip mobility or their ankle mobility and there's

69
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,400
different tests that do all these things. So the coaches would enter that information for their athletes

70
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:33,080
in their system as well. And then we also have a capability that allows our teams to ingest

71
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:39,800
all of the GPS type metrics. So you've probably seen it on the on the the TV sometimes they wear

72
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,800
the the vest that have the GPS monitors inside them. And that that that all gets an ingested into

73
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,240
into our system as well. So we have a we're in a unique position then whereby we are allowed we

74
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:57,240
are able to link all of that injury from information to all of the other information that the athletes

75
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:05,080
provide or that their coaches give us. And one of our one of our aims is to identify and drivers of

76
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:10,440
injury risk based on all that information that we collect from the from the athletes. Interesting.

77
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:18,360
So you're collecting a lot of information off the field. You mentioned the GPS vests. Are you also

78
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:26,040
is there some way that you're capturing? You know rugby. It's a contact sport from what I've seen.

79
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:32,040
Is there a way that you're capturing impacts and contact and that kind of thing as well?

80
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:39,080
Not directly. So through the through the GPS metrics and that come through from the providers.

81
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,720
There's lots of different vendors that we work with who provide this information. They're one of

82
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:50,120
their metrics that they would include would be number of impacts. Okay. So we get that information.

83
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:56,680
It comes in as part of the the GPS that type of data we would consider workload data.

84
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,880
So it's what what what what exertion to the athlete perform on the pitch whether it was in training

85
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,760
and sometimes during in games in in some leagues. They're not permitted to wear the GPS units during

86
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:12,120
games. But if it's available, we have it. When the injury information comes in in our

87
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,720
Electronical Medical Records, the practitioners would tag whether the injury came from contact

88
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:22,920
activity or a non contact activity if it was just a something that flared up over time.

89
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:32,120
And so the sports teams now have you know you've mentioned already tons of different sources of

90
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:40,360
data and I'm envisioning other things like Fitbit devices and you know even data that's extracted

91
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,920
from like computer vision models of the field, the pitch and the players. You know I imagine

92
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,520
these teams are you know quickly gotten to a point where they're a wash and data and need to

93
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:57,960
figure out how to use that data to be more competitive. Like what does the overall landscape

94
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:03,000
of data driven sports look like from your perspective? Yes. So as you mentioned and you're

95
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,880
100% correct there's the velocity volume and variety of data being collected these days.

96
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:13,160
It's such in a fast-paced sporting environment. It can cause a problem which here we kind of

97
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,920
call paralysis by analysis. I think that's a general general term anyway. What we have found is that

98
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,920
things like the tech wearables, the Fitbits etc. They deliver data and measurements back to the

99
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,960
athletes. However the the kind of crocs of it and where we kind of come in is they get the data

100
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:35,000
measurements but it's the real insights based on the linking of all the data together. It is what

101
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,640
we do here at Kipman Labs. So what we've kind of found is that while you have more data

102
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,440
that can lead to more decisions but more data here does not necessarily mean that you have

103
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:51,160
better decisions. So our key service I suppose from an analytical point of view that we provide

104
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,840
is driving insights for our teams based on the data that they put into our system.

105
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:05,400
And so those insights it sounds like are primarily around you know performance and how to optimize it

106
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:15,800
on well let me ask is it on an athlete by athlete basis or is it on a team basis and is it

107
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:26,120
well let's start there. Yeah so our data set we have like we have our system in 120 sports teams

108
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:32,760
across 35 leagues so therefore we have a lot of data ingested. What you will find is that

109
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:40,200
the insights that that you would discover they vary sport to sport position to position

110
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,520
and as you mentioned athlete to athlete and that's one of the things that that's really

111
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:50,760
interesting about our problem here when we try to solve based on say one of the things as I

112
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:58,360
mentioned was based on injury risk as is in most areas if we go down and down to athlete level

113
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,000
you will get small sample size even though some of our teams that have them with us and they have

114
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,720
them with us for four years so we have a lot of bank data built up with those customers which

115
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:13,880
makes it easier for a sport. There's interest across all the levels a lot of time there's comparison

116
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,840
so what you'll find is that teams will be interested in comparing say we're just going to like

117
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,400
their forwards to their backs and what are the key differences between those. At the moment at an

118
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:30,920
athlete level like I said small sample size very very localized insights it's quite good to

119
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,720
that we can we can turn those over but from a comparison point of view suppose positional

120
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,000
level would be good and then looking across the different injury types as well so like one of the

121
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,560
things that that we we understand here at Ekitman Labs is that the actual manifestation of injuries

122
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,080
is quite complex and you could have like obviously the drivers for a hamstring injury are going

123
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:58,840
to be quite different from the drivers for a shoulder injury for example so they're the kind

124
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:02,600
of different areas that that people would like to compare different types of injuries different

125
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:08,920
positions in their teams and we provide the the analytical solution for for our teams to be able

126
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:18,840
to do that. And you mentioned in your introduction that you apply this model or the the Ekitman works

127
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:27,000
with some of your favorite sports rugby and some of your national sports but what other sports do

128
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,320
you have you applied this model to? Yes so we have like I said rugby would is one we have soccer

129
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,160
teams we have cricket teams we have baseball teams basketball American football

130
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:45,800
then Australia we've probably league so we do have like a broad range of sports across a broad

131
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,600
range of continents that that that contribute information into our system. Okay and so you're

132
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:57,960
now a data scientist in a playground of you know data around your favorite topic how do you

133
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,440
approach trying to deliver insights to these teams with this data that they have?

134
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,440
Yes so we work quite closely with our applied sports science team and our applied sports

135
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:15,240
science team here at Ekitman Labs they deal directly with our customers find out their needs

136
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,200
and and figure out and if they're there's certain areas that we should be looking at from an

137
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,400
analytical point of view. So our main kind of application and our main insights driver

138
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:31,160
Ekitman Labs and what we've we've developed and what we've been working on to to help reduce

139
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:40,040
kind of injury risk across our teams we work on the basis that we that coaches would like to know

140
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,960
what are the things that are driving injury risk so they collect all of this data and in our system

141
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:51,320
you can view that on a dashboard so when they come in they can see the dashboard which allows

142
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:58,600
them to view the current status of the athletes and they can then set alarms on that data and alarm

143
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:04,840
being go red if a if an athlete gets into a certain band or a certain range or over a certain

144
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:10,040
amount of a variable or it can be green if you're happy with them the color coding think kind of

145
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:16,200
depends on the the personal preference of the practitioner. So our practitioners traditionally

146
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:21,080
could just set their alarms based on their own intuition and their own judgment

147
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,760
and expertise but where we come in and where the the main analytics that that we work on

148
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:34,680
here at Ekitman is to provide data behind that and to potentially provide data driven alarm

149
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,600
thresholds for the practitioners to set that will fire when their athletes get into a certain

150
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,880
range or you think they might be in trouble. So maybe to to apply some examples and be a little

151
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:54,840
bit more concrete here it sounds like you're saying that traditionally or maybe not traditionally

152
00:15:54,840 --> 00:16:01,960
but you know one way of approaching keeping athletes healthy and in high-performance zones

153
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:09,800
would be to set a threshold that said you know that would allow a you know one of the sports

154
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:14,520
medicine staff out of team to say well you know I'm concerned about overtraining I don't want

155
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:21,880
this athlete to train you know more than X hours a day and so that's a intuition based

156
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:29,880
threshold that they might set but you're maybe doing some analysis or building some models based

157
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:36,840
on the data that you've collected to allow them to more dynamically optimize those kinds of

158
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,480
thresholds maybe you know based on based on this starting point maybe you can give us some specific

159
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,560
examples and the kinds of you know modeling models and approaches that you might use for different

160
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:54,520
teams. Exactly so suppose from the first point is that we initially when we started on this

161
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:00,280
journey relating injury risk to the different metrics in our system the alarms that we set up

162
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,400
they were on a univariate level so we started small and kind of built it up along as as we

163
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:11,400
continued through our journey at a univariate level we have a system in place that a practitioner

164
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,040
can set an alarm like you mentioned a certain number of training hours per day I mean we provide

165
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:21,400
the analysis for them to check that alarm and see how relevant that alarm is based on their

166
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:28,040
injury risk. And meaning meaning what specifically so one thing you're doing is you're allowing them

167
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:36,120
to pull different data sources together so they can even easily track how many hours a given

168
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:42,280
athlete has been training. Exactly so once they put the data into our system it's all

169
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:47,160
collated into essential repository and metrics that they wish to view or that they wish to set

170
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,600
alarms on that they wish to monitor for their athletes are displayed in their dashboard.

171
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:57,800
So not not only are the I suppose the raw metrics displayed we also allow them to create different

172
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:03,160
aggregations and things that they might be concerned about as well so what you'll find is kind of

173
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,920
you know in a sports related area obviously if you're coming up to a game the things that happen

174
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:13,320
in the few days leading up to a game can be very important to determine whether an athlete is

175
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:19,080
going to perform well in that game or not. So we allow them to to create different aggregations

176
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:25,960
for example their workload over the last seven days their max speed over the last seven days

177
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,720
that they did in training we allow them to look at different metrics in those types of aggregations

178
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:36,520
and also what is very important and what we found to be important is like the change in those

179
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,880
metrics leading up to the game so we allow them to calculate z scores and complex n scores so

180
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,920
they have an abundance of data that they can display across their dashboard and set alarms

181
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:53,400
off that that I'm concerned if athlete goes into does as you said over XR as a training per week.

182
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:00,280
The analysis that we perform then takes that data so for their positional group or that

183
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:07,320
that they they're involved in and looks at how that that metric relates to the different types

184
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,120
of injuries that other people in their positions would have gotten so that if they're concerned about

185
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,480
that they can set the alarm or change their alarm based on what the data is actually telling them

186
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,080
and use that then on top of their own intuition. Tell me a little bit about the kind of the modeling

187
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,680
process and how you as a data scientist have built up these models over time.

188
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:34,920
Yeah so the most recent I suppose model that that we were working on was what I was talking

189
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:39,400
about previously was all at a uni-variate level so is this one metric related to injury risk

190
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:46,040
and more recently we've developed into the multi-variate alarm so the idea with that is that

191
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,960
the customer is identified where their injury problems are for example they look at a diagnostic

192
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:58,840
injury for their season they had a really bad hamstring problem so they will access our system

193
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,880
and they'll say okay look at my for the season look at my hamstring injuries and we have been

194
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,840
built models that will turn around and tell them different types of injuries for different

195
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:14,280
combinations of metrics. So the idea then is that they will choose an injury level that they're

196
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,640
comfortable with or they'll see affwatt at what values for different combinations of metrics

197
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,120
was were my athletes at the higher injury risk and then they can set that for their group of

198
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,880
for their group of athletes so going forward into next season hopefully they'll get a warning

199
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:34,760
if this injury risk increases. So from our point of view then at the on the data science team

200
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,200
the key thing from us from a machine learning point of view is that our analysis has to be

201
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:47,800
transparent so while there are amazing models out there that would give you a really good risk score

202
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:53,000
or a prediction as they say what we have learned and what I mentioned our collaboration with the

203
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:59,400
sport science team earlier our customers in particular here they need to know why so here we need

204
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,840
to know what's going on but going on in the box so the important thing for us is that the models

205
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:11,880
that we use here are transparent interpretable and that we are able to build on top of the key

206
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:17,480
metrics and figure out then what the optimal thresholds are for each of those metrics based on

207
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,720
the injury risk specification for the injuries that the teams are interested.

208
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:29,640
And so what models does that leave you to use? So it would be the more I suppose traditional models

209
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,880
the ones that wouldn't be considered black box that we would so again models that are

210
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:42,040
quite transparent and easily interpretable like in general and some of the analysis that we would

211
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:48,200
perform you would find decision trees would be quite an interesting approach to this because you

212
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:54,600
automatically get both your related metrics and your specific thresholds and that come true

213
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,800
in terms of we then take out from that and kind of make it into a more consumable format

214
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:06,120
because I suppose the kind of key crocs of that is that the practitioners and the coaches using

215
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:10,600
our system they don't have a lot of time so if we put a big massive decision tree up in front of

216
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,280
them that's not going to be easily interpretable or consumable for them so we need to and that's

217
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,600
one of the things that's really good about being a data scientist here as well is that we will

218
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:26,120
work with design and product and figure out how that's going to be implemented kind of from a

219
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:30,680
conceptual analytical point of view into something that's easily digestible for our coaches.

220
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,520
That's interesting. Can you talk more about that process? Where does it manifest itself? Does it

221
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:43,880
impact the design that you will ultimately choose or the model type or parameters that you'd

222
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,640
ultimately choose as a data scientist or is it more with a given model that you've chosen

223
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:59,240
for other reasons like performance? The way you communicate and display the types of things

224
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,000
that customers will want to know about from that model? Yes, we will spend a lot of time

225
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,760
in the conceptual formulation phase where we will develop the algorithms. Our general process

226
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,640
would be to potentially come up with two or three different algorithms, compare them, build

227
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:21,080
prototypes so that the prototypes can then be validated so they can be validated both internally

228
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:26,440
and with the other members of our team so with the product and design team with the engineers

229
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,040
if it became that this algorithm needs to be implemented in our product. Can we can you support

230
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,920
that? Can you help us with that? But also for the we would do external validation as well with

231
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:41,400
our customers so that will be again where the collaboration with the sports science team would

232
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,280
come in. They have the ability to take the prototypes that we build, show them to customers,

233
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:51,640
we get feedback that gets implemented and then again it's a massive collaboration effort.

234
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,200
When all of that comes together we go back to the design team, figure out how it's going to fit

235
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:01,560
into the product and it moves on then to engineering into the product and eventually then into

236
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:06,760
the hands of the customers themselves. And so have you had situations where you know for

237
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:14,600
example you chose a simpler model because it was easier to present the results to customers or do

238
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:22,200
use the model but invest extra on the presentation side after assuming a given model in place

239
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:29,960
is in place. I suppose that there is a bit of both we would always aim for the optimal model

240
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,440
but we would always vary in the back of our mind that the optimal model that we build in our

241
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:43,160
prototype against our data set that it can be quite resource consuming and potentially not

242
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:47,960
sustainable given the amount of data that we have that goes into the product. So we have

243
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,920
like I said a lot of collaboration with the engineering team to make sure that the solutions

244
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,640
that we come up with are indeed implement you are able to implement them into the product and that

245
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,840
they won't break everything that it won't be very slow. So we would do a lot of testing with

246
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:08,840
the different types of data all the aggregations that we have and we would try to come up with

247
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:15,960
something that satisfies every member I suppose of the team involved and again is the best model

248
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,400
that will get good insights for our customers that that's the most important thing is that the

249
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:28,120
the customers are getting the insights the why I'm getting such an injury risk score and not just

250
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:34,760
what the percentage is. And out of curiosity do you use a lot of ensembles of models or do they

251
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:42,360
tend to be simpler models? We tend to keep it more simple. Okay again at the presentation. Yeah,

252
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:51,160
the interpretability of models that we would use. I mean in saying that the data science team

253
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:58,680
we like to be innovative in ourselves so we would have departmental workshops whereby we would

254
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:05,320
do things that on the side like that try different types of models see how they would work

255
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:12,840
while we're always dripping that forward. So at the moment we are focused on actionable insights

256
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:18,280
key deliverables that the practitioners can combine with their own intuition to make their decisions

257
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:24,200
but that's not to say that that's going forward for different areas that we might be getting into

258
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:29,320
that that models like that wouldn't be would be more applicable. How is your product delivered?

259
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:36,520
Is it a cloud-based solution where your customers are uploading their data centrally or is it

260
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:45,560
mobile or desktop? So there's a web browser that the coaches and the backroom staff I suppose

261
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:51,320
get access to to login to where everything is displayed and through there they would upload

262
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:59,560
their information in terms of the EMR, electronic and medical records. From the other ways we

263
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:05,560
collect data we have a mobile app so we have a mobile app for the athletes themselves so they

264
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,280
install the app and they put in their subjective type measures. We have another mobile app for the

265
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:15,400
coaches which provides a summary of all of the information that they would see on the dashboard

266
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:22,040
when they log into the web app. They get that on their phones and you find I think in sports

267
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,680
complexes or in the training grounds particularly throughout the pitch they wouldn't have a lot of

268
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:33,800
Wi-Fi so having something on the mobile is more efficient for them. We have the web browser as I

269
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:39,960
mentioned and we also have a motion capture data collection system which is quite interesting

270
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:49,240
so we have a system where you stand in front of a camera and it uses infrared sensors to detect

271
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:55,480
the athlete and we take them through a series of movements and they kind of follow a demo as

272
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,600
it's going through, perform the movements and we get all that data back into our system as well.

273
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,920
And what types of analytics does the motion capture roll up into?

274
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:12,280
So again the outputs from that would they get cleaned and transformed but they would then

275
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:17,240
essentially just become metrics on the teams can put onto their dashboards as well so you would be

276
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:24,600
looking for things like angle of your internal shoulder rotation or how aligned were your knees

277
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,960
when you were doing a squash these kind of things so we have metrics that get derived automatically

278
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:35,000
from them from the system. A lot to do with alignment between say the left and right side of your

279
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,280
body and how good your your movement is as you go through the different movements we have like

280
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:48,040
squats, lunges, y balance these kind of different things. I was just talking to someone about

281
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:54,360
they were someone made a comment about how they wanted to get a like a workout coach or something

282
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:59,640
like that so that they can you know get an analysis of their technique. Do you see that kind of

283
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:08,520
thing being more commoditized and available just via you know mobile devices and you know deep

284
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:14,200
learning just kind of point the camera at you while you're doing your squats and it'll tell you

285
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,200
how good your technique is. Yeah a hundred percent I think that that's where where everything is

286
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:25,240
going. I mean like I mentioned that that our system that we have here is at the moment only

287
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:32,120
currently provided to like elite teams and professional athletes but in saying that I mean with

288
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:38,360
the kind of the prosumers of the technology like someone trying to better themselves saying

289
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,440
in a more amateur type setting or as an individual sport all of these things are applicable.

290
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,480
And there's such developments again in technology I mean there's something new coming out every day

291
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,720
that a hundred percent I I would believe that like personal personal workout or your your own

292
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:02,120
smart trainer your own smart coach these things are definitely not too far down the line from us

293
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,520
with with all of the developments and technology that are happening. Yeah having said that I'm sure

294
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:12,120
listeners will tweet me like five to ten companies that are already doing this thing. Yeah I wouldn't

295
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,520
I wouldn't doubt that. I mean I know one of the things that that kind of always interests me

296
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:23,160
and I think that where we're going is kind of the smart sports equipment and I'm sure that there

297
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:29,000
are companies out there for example if you're using a equipment in your sport like for example say

298
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,720
a baseball bash I'm sure there are companies out there that are developing the technology to

299
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,320
look at your motion as you swing it and hate it and I mean I I guess there are people out there

300
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:45,800
even with footwear with boots or trainers that people are wearing as they're performing that to

301
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,280
detect from that as well so the the abundance the data that that's going to be coming in it

302
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:57,640
is is just going to grow exponentially I imagine. And so what do you see as the key challenges face

303
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:04,680
by data scientists as they're working in fields like this with the the data volumes rising but

304
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:10,280
where a very personalized approach needs to be taken. I think the key the key challenges

305
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:18,760
would be in I suppose identifying the noise that that that that is their from us so as that

306
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:24,520
becomes to kind of a more a more personalized level I think one of the one of the good things

307
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,600
about these is that people like to compare themselves to other people of a similar nature

308
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:36,120
and so the challenges would be providing good insights at a localized level with with small

309
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:42,520
sample size whereas the kind of benefit of that is that you can yield from from a larger data

310
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:49,000
setup of similar population and and if people engaged with that and get people engaged with

311
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,640
in with different ways that they can engage their customers and the the consumers of this information

312
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:03,800
potentially that would be where they can kind of overcome the challenges of small sample size

313
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,680
and and and that that that would come from a more personal approach. Yeah I was going to ask a

314
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:16,760
related question to this earlier even with with all of the teams that you work with and all

315
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:23,880
of the athletes that play for those teams you know often there's a situation where the the events

316
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,800
that you want to model against your your interests set you know our injuries which are relatively

317
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:37,240
infrequent as compared to your overall data set is that a challenge in your case and how do you

318
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:44,920
address that challenge. Yeah so within our data set like one of our challenges that we have

319
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:51,960
is that you have teams that they screen differently so it's you can have a team that will require

320
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:56,760
their athletes to go through screenings one day a week or you will have teams that will require

321
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,240
their athletes to go through three days a week or five days a week or every single day depending

322
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:08,040
on whether they're training or not. Okay so that can be quite quite of one of the challenges so

323
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:13,160
it can be quite difficult to to compare two different teams if they have completely different

324
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,440
training methods and when we're delivering our insights back to our customers that they they're

325
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,760
aware that it's all their own data and if anybody wants something at a kind of a more aggregated

326
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:29,080
level we will have the caveat that you are aware this is different sport different et cetera so

327
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:37,240
used as a kind of a guideline. In terms of from our point of view we would have and it's quite good

328
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:43,640
a lot of our teams would have compliance rules so they would require their athletes to screen

329
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:49,000
a certain amount so we're aware of that so we know how often the athletes are screening and how

330
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,760
they're meant to screen before we kind of attach any analysis to what they're doing so I mean for

331
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,720
one team they screen three times another team they screen once a week we know that so we can

332
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,040
then adjust any analytics that we perform for them kind of according to that and you would have

333
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,560
as I said the compliance and the teams would expect I think some of them it can be in their

334
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:14,120
contracts that they're required to screen a certain number of times a week and to provide data.

335
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:20,520
How do you do that from a you know techniques perspective and is this kind of a sampling exercise

336
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:28,760
or normalization exercise or how do you work with your data so that you can allow folks to

337
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,880
compare metrics that have different you know volumes of sampling coming in.

338
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:43,640
Yes so we in general like we would I suppose if have the problem of you would have missing data

339
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:52,120
if athletes don't screen on certain days we tend to look to the customer and ask them so

340
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,440
why we would have obviously there are statistical methods and as you mentioned yourself normalization

341
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:04,520
and different things and taking the average over a certain period of time or rolling the last

342
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,160
value that they had forward to all these different or imputing by a model all these different

343
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,280
things we tend to work with customers and see how they would they would feel about that so what do

344
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,960
they think would be the best approach for them for their own specific analysis and that would be

345
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:24,440
kind of an option it's not currently built in but something that we are looking to to go towards

346
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:29,560
so even if there is a very poor quality of metric collected they have the option not to include

347
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,600
that in any analysis so for example if they only for the the period of time that they choose

348
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,960
if they only have valid data for say 10% of the time just wrote not going to include that at all

349
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,560
just don't there's not enough information for the the games if it's something that's screened

350
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,600
quite frequently or something you'll find that that they might screen and collect for a while and

351
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:54,760
then not collect after that so again it is quite and like I said we do with collaborate quite

352
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,520
closely with our applied sports science team who are very close to the customers and take that

353
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:03,720
guide and so for example one of the things that that if we were to impute by a model there would be

354
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:11,080
the question that well how is that number calculated and step that kind of led would lead to more

355
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:16,840
questions being asked so it is quite on a team by team basis and we would do a lot of collaboration

356
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,160
of people and on making that decision for themselves okay so make sure they understand the various

357
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:29,560
trade-offs and in surfacing those trade-offs via the tooling exactly yeah okay and out of curiosity

358
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:35,720
mentioning tooling what kind of tools are in your tool chain so the data science team here

359
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:42,920
acutement labs at the moment utilize mostly ore and python okay so a lot of our analysis

360
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:51,640
is carried out in ore the prototypes that we build in ore using the shiny app that would be

361
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,200
sent out for validation and where everything that that would eventually end up in the product

362
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,240
kind of grows from but we're kind of developing python types of as well at the moment so

363
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:07,000
there's a little bit of both going on and you mentioned shiny app what's that so shiny is

364
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:14,200
part of the R studio package okay shiny allows you to take all the code and display it in a web

365
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:20,200
browser and build your own little mini application basically so that's kind of what we do with the

366
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,200
analysis and set it up so that the sports science team can can go and take it out to site and they

367
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:30,200
don't need us with them that they can click around and make selections and it runs the analysis

368
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:37,640
and displays things back to the customers okay so it sounds like you're actively involved in

369
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:44,600
helping sports teams further their performance help their help keep their athletes healthy

370
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:52,760
where do you see this going what are the opportunities for teams to use the data that they have

371
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:58,600
available and the data that you know will soon be available to them yes so I mean at the moment

372
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:05,720
we and up until now we've been very injury focused so again the idea would be to keep the athlete

373
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:11,400
healthy that we would instigate the alarms that would allow them to identify when when a

374
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:17,720
potential athlete is potentially at risk going forward and for them then to make their their own

375
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:22,600
judgment and decision about what the action to take on that is so should they potentially reduce

376
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:28,120
their training load or get them to screen again these these kind of things so from the injury

377
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,880
type of view we've we've kind of been looking at individual risk factors the interactions of those

378
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:39,880
and identifying kind of different types of responders then to to an action or an intervention

379
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:44,920
and it's somewhere where we think that that that we might carry on with this and eventually kind of

380
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:51,800
to work towards the the forecasting and proactive planning so to kind of look forward and say okay

381
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,840
in the next week these athletes should only do this workload and this workload so so that's kind of

382
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:02,520
the where where where we'd like to get into from an injury point of view also moving on from

383
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,120
that then is is kind of what's becoming quite evident and important is kind of the performance in

384
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:14,040
games so we have a lot of information about our athletes and that the information that they give us

385
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,000
the pictures we call their psychophysiological metrics and at the moment we've been really

386
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,680
injury focused with that but we're hoping to move into the area of in-game performance and see how

387
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,000
the the information in our system relates to how they perform in games so there are lots of

388
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:35,720
companies out there opta in stat etc providing breakdowns of of how players performed in games

389
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:40,360
their technical metrics how many shots they missed they scored tackles missed

390
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:45,960
interceptions etc depending for all the sports and and we're hoping to to get an area where

391
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,560
we can relate what's in our system with with those things and move on to to performance in-game

392
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:58,440
so we we we are hoping to to get an area a time where you can assess potentially when teams

393
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:04,280
are more likely to beat a team they do these certain things and the fifth psychophysiological

394
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,640
metrics that are in our system how we can relate those and and try and get our teams to to boost

395
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:15,800
their performance and increase their chance of winning well shane thank you so much for taking

396

397
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:27,400
interesting things yeah and and long hopefully it will continue like that awesome thank you so much
