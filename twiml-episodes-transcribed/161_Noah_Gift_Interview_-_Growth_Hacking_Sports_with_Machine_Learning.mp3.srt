00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:31,400
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,800
In this episode of our AI and sports series, I'm joined by Noah Gift, founder and consulting

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,440
CTO at Pragmatic Labs and professor at UC Davis.

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,280
Noah previously worked for a startup called Score Sports, which used machine learning to

7
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,560
uncover athlete influence on social media and internet platforms.

8
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,120
Noah and I look into some of his findings in that role, including how to predict the

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,920
impact of athlete's social media engagement.

10
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,640
We also discussed some of his more recent work using social media to predict which players

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,720
hold the most on-court value and how this work could lead to more complete approaches

12
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,320
to player valuation.

13
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,840
Finally, we spent some time discussing some areas that Noah sees as ripe for new research

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,360
and experimentation across sports.

15
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,320
And we take a look at his upcoming book, Pragmatic AI, an introduction to cloud-based machine

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,480
learning.

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:27,040
For those interested in pre-ordering the book, be sure to check out the link in the show

18
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,560
notes for a nice discount code.

19
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,280
And now on to the show.

20
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,640
All right everyone, I am on the line with Noah Gift.

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:42,720
Noah is a consulting CTO and professor at UC Davis and was recently CTO of a sports company

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,840
Score Sports. Noah, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

23
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,040
Hi, glad to be here.

24
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,560
It's great to have you on the show.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,000
It is our tradition here to have our guests introduce themselves to the audience.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,840
And why don't you do that and tell us a little bit about how you got involved in AI and

27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,840
machine learning.

28
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,240
Yeah, so I have, I think a pretty unusual background in that for a period of my life when I was

29
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,960
about 10 years old, I worked in television and film, I grew up in Los Angeles.

30
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:17,720
So I have this other career as a teenager and it culminated in working as a editor for

31
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,800
ABC Network News on, you know, national news.

32
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,200
You know, I remember distinctly cutting the story about OG Simpson and passing that live

33
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,200
on the air.

34
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Oh wow.

35
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,200
Yeah, so I had to keep going.

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,760
And then just put push-paws on that.

37
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,440
Like how did that happen?

38
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,080
Is that like, did you start as like the typical child star thing and find your way into the

39
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,600
quote-unquote back office or editing or something like that or was it a totally different

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,640
path from what we might imagine?

41
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,040
Well, it was totally different in that my dad had a television production company.

42
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,920
So I guess it's a little bit like how, you know, there's kids now that are writing

43
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,440
iPhone apps at 10 because her dad was a programmer.

44
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:02,160
Well, my dad worked television and he had a company and I was working with him.

45
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:08,360
I guess as an apprentice, television, camera, you know, microphones, editing, just knew

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
all the stuff.

47
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,360
Awesome.

48
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,080
And then it just accommodated and I eventually got it.

49
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,240
It's again, there's a lot like a programmer, you get a job as an editor.

50
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,600
At the time, as you had to know the equipment, you go into, you know, a lot like a programming

51
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
test.

52
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,160
You go to let's say ABC and you say, hey, I'm an editor and they say, okay, well, let's

53
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,200
see if you can edit and they give you a test and if you pass it, then they hire you.

54
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,760
And so I passed it and I worked for the news for a while and this is 1992, I think,

55
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,600
the 1993, and at the time I was, I was getting paid like $500 a day.

56
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,640
So for a teenager, that was, that was, that was very nice.

57
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,600
That was very happy with that salary.

58
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,320
And then I just, I was actually given the opportunity to do that as a full-time job.

59
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:58,760
But even though my dad was actually encouraging me to never go to college, I was, I rebelled

60
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,800
and decided to go a different path.

61
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,280
And I think part of it was that I've always been really interested in sports and I was

62
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,520
competitive at basketball, football, track and, and in college, did to Cathlon.

63
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,640
And basically, there's a period in my life where there's, I wanted to be a professional

64
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,640
athlete.

65
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,480
I didn't care what sport was, track, basketball.

66
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,600
Even at one point, Ultimate Frisbee, I remember, there was, in my mid 20s, there's a guy

67
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,680
that was trying to, you know, get me onto his pro, Ultimate Frisbee, or semi-pro, I

68
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,680
guess, Ultimate Frisbee team.

69
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,200
But that's probably why I eventually ended up getting a bachelor's degree from Cal Poly

70
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,360
San Francisco was, in nutritional science, was just, that was my passion.

71
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,480
And then when I, there was a period after I graduated from Cal Poly that, that I was training

72
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,520
to play professional basketball.

73
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,160
And I was training with some people that played on teams in Europe and I, you know, had

74
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:04,360
some trials scheduled and then at the same time I was, my back at plan was to get a job

75
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,360
somewhere.

76
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,880
And I'd, I'd happen to get a job offer at Cal Tech.

77
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,600
And so it was a very difficult decision for me to go, oh, wow, this is a Cal Tech or

78
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,320
try to play professional basketball and make, you know, 20 grand a year.

79
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,840
And I decided to work at Cal Tech.

80
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:27,080
You know, I still in that way have some regrets about that, but I work, I, I, I got a

81
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:33,120
job at Cal Tech and I, I really it, from there it changed a lot of the way I think in it.

82
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,760
That's really what got me interested in AI was some of the people I met, I mean, really

83
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,760
changed my life.

84
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:47,160
I learned about Python there back in 2000, nobody used Python, but it was just something

85
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,480
that all my friends did.

86
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,240
So I figured I had to do it.

87
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,560
And then I met a lot of really famous AI people.

88
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Just accidentally.

89
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,560
It was like Forest Gump.

90
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,560
I mean, the, the Feifei, who is in charge of AI at Google, I remember having dinner

91
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:09,480
with her, just randomly meeting her, um, Kristoff Coke at the CNS lab, who is in charge

92
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:16,640
of Paul Allen's Institute, just some guy I knew, um, one of my really good friends and mentors

93
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,360
was this guy named Dr. Bogan, who did the first hemisfrectomy.

94
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:25,440
Um, I remember going to his house all the time, hemisfrectomy, hemisfrectomy, removing

95
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,800
half of the brain, uh, it was a, it was a, it was a procedure that was done to, um, you

96
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,800
know, they didn't do it that often, but it was done for epileptic patients that had,

97
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,480
you know, basically debilitating seizures.

98
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Okay.

99
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:45,600
And he was working under Kristoff Coke and, and he became a mentor to me and I, I distinctly

100
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,080
remember having many conversations at dinner about neural networks and how they're used

101
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,320
to, uh, figure out who would be, uh, a fighter pilot and, and, and so all these ideas about

102
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:03,080
AI and neural networks were, what percolating at the time I was, you know, an okay, you

103
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:10,360
know, I would say, uh, amateurish, you know, cis admin type programmer, but so in a way

104
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,560
as funny, I was much more interested in AI back then in my early 20s, um, and, and in

105
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,120
fact, before I was even interested in programming, and I remember talking to a professor at,

106
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,360
at Caltech and he'll probably, you know, he'll probably not admit to this, but I remember,

107
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,560
we're asking him, like, hey, I'm so excited about AI, and he said, oh, you should even,

108
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,920
uh, think about that.

109
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
It's a dead field.

110
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:37,960
It's, uh, you know, AI winter, you know, just, you're wasting your time.

111
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,120
And I, I just remember thinking, well, I think I'll, I think I'll be interested in it

112
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
in a way.

113
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,760
And, and I had, I actually set this goal for myself that, um, and it's, I think I've achieved

114
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,360
it, which is that by the time I'm 40, I wanted to be doing something serious and AI, and I

115
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,080
wanted to be fluent in several programming languages.

116
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
And that's pretty much happened.

117
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,080
And nice.

118
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,920
I think, yeah, I was part of it was just the people I met and, and also, I guess I've

119
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,680
always been motivated by people that tell me, maybe it's the sports part of me, but

120
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,880
people that told me, oh, oh, you can't do that.

121
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,520
And it's like, oh, okay, well, that's exactly what I'm going to do that very nice, very

122
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,520
nice.

123
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,040
And so you, uh, Cal Tech led to a bunch of other places and most recently before you

124
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,280
went off on your own to do consulting, you were at a startup called score sports.

125
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Is that right?

126
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Yeah.

127
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,960
So, so score sports was interesting to me, again, because of the, the, the athletic component

128
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
to it.

129
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:45,240
And before that worked in film and had a whole other history of, you know, what a digital

130
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:49,720
avatar and Disney future animation and so many image works, really cool film companies

131
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,680
and where I did a lot of Python programming.

132
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,840
But then, uh, and then I spent a long time in, in startups and, you know, doing that in

133
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,840
San Francisco.

134
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:04,200
But then there was a part of me that was a little not perfectly fitting in, I guess, with

135
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,680
the culture of San Francisco and that, and that, again, I've always been really athletic

136
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,960
and into sports and there, there's, there's almost like an anti healthy, I think it's changed

137
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
now.

138
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,920
But there's almost like this, like, oh, you exercise.

139
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Oh, that's weird.

140
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,720
You know, like, at least I felt that way at the start of movie, but maybe I was, I had

141
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
a couple of likes.

142
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
I don't know.

143
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,840
But, um, I really liked that this was a sports company and people worked out together

144
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:35,600
and they, they actually did, um, mixed martial arts at lunch and so it was really interesting

145
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,600
to me.

146
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,600
I mean, this is, this is a, this is a really cool culture and I started there.

147
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,080
We really didn't have a product and we, we struggled a little bit initially to build something

148
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,120
and the first three months I was there, though, we, we were able to build a, um, a, uh, lightweight

149
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,480
fantasy app that had a lot of traction and we're like, and we were like, okay, this is,

150
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,600
this is maybe, we're on to something here and we were very fortunate, though, because

151
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,840
we had some, um, secret, uh, weapons, I guess and one of our secret weapons was Brett

152
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,840
Farve.

153
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,840
He was on the board of the company and, you know, he, he was, we knew that if we built something

154
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:20,480
that was marginally useful that having him a part of it would, would really take off.

155
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,000
And so the idea for the company was that we were going to be a sports specific social network

156
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,560
and I guess in a way, thinking about Facebook and it's funny now, there's a lot of controversy

157
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,920
around Facebook because of, um, trolls and, you know, uh, yeah, fake news and, and, and,

158
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,400
and, and at the time, though, I think really that the premise was a good premise, which

159
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,640
is there are people that just really don't want to be on Facebook.

160
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,200
They just want to talk about sports.

161
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Right.

162
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,240
And that was the idea it was that I kept, they don't want to, they don't want to rethink

163
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
news.

164
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,640
They don't want to talk about politics or religion.

165
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,240
They just want to talk about sports.

166
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:59,520
And so that's what we started to build and took us about a year and we built, um, a social

167
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,280
network and I remember we had, you know, almost no traffic and one of the first things we

168
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:10,880
did though was we were pretty smart and that we, we used Brett Flarge to create a prediction

169
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,560
around the NFL draft in 2014.

170
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:16,840
And this is when Johnny Menzel was, was a big deal.

171
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:21,440
He was in the NFL draft and, and he talked about it and posted it on score and then, and

172
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,760
then linked to it from Facebook and Twitter and it just, I mean, it was like, uh, you

173
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:32,880
know, one of the biggest, uh, traffic's days of all time almost, you know, it was, it

174
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,760
was, it was, I think we got, uh, something like five million page views in an hour, like

175
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,880
just a lot of, yeah, just incredible traffic.

176
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,200
And then some of the comments were, you know, I'm crying, I'm so happy that Brett Flarge

177
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,320
talking to me and liking my pose and we're like, okay, this, we're on to something here.

178
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,640
And so as we, as we, at, we knew that there were, and this is where some of the ML and AI

179
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:04,800
stuff comes in is that originally the thought process too was to, was to provide, um, tools

180
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,440
for athletes to better engage with their fans, um, make revenue.

181
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,640
We felt like they were getting ripped off by Facebook, um, and that if, if you look at

182
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,880
the organic reach of some of these athletes, you know, they're, they're going down to one

183
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,240
to three percent.

184
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,560
And so we, we, the idea was that we wanted to, you know, give intelligent tools, athletes,

185
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,440
create a specific channel.

186
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,640
And then we knew that it's based on some of the historical data that some celebrities

187
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,320
were like Brett Flarge created a lot of traffic.

188
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:41,720
So the thought process was instead of what typical startups do, uh, by, by buying a lot of

189
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:47,920
Facebook ads, we were going to create organic growth by partnering with athletes and, but

190
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,120
first finding the athletes that were influential, partnering with them.

191
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:59,400
And then because we, we're helping them, it was a synergistic relationship and that not

192
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:05,560
only, um, would we get growth from the platform, but when you pay somebody oftentimes, they're

193
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,560
very friendly with you.

194
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,080
And so they're, they're open to other opportunities.

195
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:14,480
So that led to two business, um, units in a company that I helped develop, along with some

196
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,440
other people, which were, um, influential marketing, uh, part of the company, which,

197
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,600
ultimately grew to millions of dollars of revenue, uh, and culminated probably the biggest

198
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,520
deal we had was with machine zone, and Connor McGregor.

199
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,880
And then we also had a merchandising part of our company.

200
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,480
So we pay, we pay athletes, we find the best athletes, they, they create growth on our

201
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,720
platform because we have this, um, you know, great relationship with the athletes there

202
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,920
that open to do more deals, which are other influencer marketing deals and also merchandising.

203
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:50,560
But the, the, the beginning stage there was that as we, as we learned from the data, uh,

204
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,640
that was coming in from the page views and where it came from, we, we did realize that

205
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,760
there was something there that we could, we could use machine learning on to enhance.

206
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,840
And really that, the, the, the core of it was that we were able to look at signals, um,

207
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:11,840
on Facebook, look at signals on, on Twitter and look at signals and other sources, including

208
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:17,840
with Wikipedia and create an algorithm that told us who were the most influential, um,

209
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,240
athletes.

210
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,240
And there were some stars that we discovered and one of them was Connor McGregor and Connor

211
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,240
McGregor.

212
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,360
I think is a very interesting one and that, uh, I did this talk of strata just, um, uh,

213
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,920
week ago, but when, when we partnered with him in 2014, I think his average likes per

214
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,360
a post were something like 50, you know, which I think I've gotten posts that are, you

215
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,800
know, 50, 50 likes on them, I mean, maybe not all of them, but it, and then if you look

216
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,880
at now, it's something like, um, I don't know, 4,000 or 5,000.

217
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:57,760
And so he's, I think had 7,000 times, uh, engagement growth in the last four years.

218
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,640
And what, that was, that was one of the things that we noticed in terms of, um, in signals

219
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,800
was that, is that the follow accounts are really, and I probably people know this by now,

220
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:13,240
but follow accounts are really meaningless because of the bots and people buying things.

221
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,760
Really the thing to look at is, is what is in, in relative terms, what's the engagement?

222
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:25,040
You know, our, our, you know, if the meeting level engagement is, is, is very high in relative

223
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,400
uh, percentage to your followers, then that means you're a star and you're going to be

224
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,800
eventually growing, you know, like Connor McGregor, for example.

225
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,040
And so those are the kind of signals that we look for, and then as we got more athletes

226
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,320
that we partnered with, we would get more historical data and the algorithm would get better.

227
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:49,760
And, um, in a nutshell, it did lead to us getting, uh, for a period of time, uh, sustained,

228
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:54,320
you know, tens of millions of monthly active users on, on our platform, and then ultimately

229
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,600
culminated in a partnership with, um, one of the largest soccer clubs in the world,

230
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:05,480
which is Bayern Munich, um, but like, I think, uh, 97% of startups, we ultimately, ultimately

231
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,160
failed, but there was definitely a good run there.

232
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,400
Can you talk a little bit about how you used machine learning in that example?

233
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:16,480
I think the way you set up the problem, it sounds like simple math, right, divide aggregate

234
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,440
number of likes by a number of followers or something along those lines, uh, but it

235
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:26,040
sounds like you were doing something else involving collecting historical data and training

236
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
a model.

237
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
Can you talk a little bit about that?

238
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
Yeah.

239
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,880
There's definitely a super, I mean, and this is one of the things I think it's interesting

240
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:39,960
about machine learning and, um, in reading books or, or teaching, you know, in teaching

241
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:45,920
a class at, at Davis, when I'm talking to this, uh, about this, is that it's easy to get

242
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,440
a book that you read about some algorithm or psychic learning or Kaggle.

243
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,240
It's like, oh, look, I have this supervised learning data set, but in the real world, you

244
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,400
don't even know what it is you're solving.

245
00:16:56,400 --> 00:17:00,600
And that's in a way, kind of the fun thing is like, what, what, what problem are we even

246
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,600
trying to solve?

247
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,920
And it's, oh, we want to, we want to predict page views.

248
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,840
That's what we ultimately came up with is, oh, so the more page views we get, the, the

249
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:11,600
more users come on our platform and then they go through our conversion funnel and, and

250
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,200
we get, uh, low, low, um, uh, acquisition rate for users, like a much lower, so what,

251
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,320
what, what, okay, first, first thing was to look at, you know, what are the features, right?

252
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:27,680
Like, what, what can we, what are the signals, um, that are telling us, uh, you know, how

253
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,680
to predict page views?

254
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,280
And so that did, that, that actually was a very complex problem in a way for, for a few

255
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,280
different reasons.

256
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,560
One is that, you know, in general, again, if it's not a Kaggle data set, we were like,

257
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:42,480
oh, look, all my features are here, you know, like, in this case, you don't just don't,

258
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
you just don't know.

259
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
And labels.

260
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,680
Yeah, and labels and, yeah, it's like, let me just search through here and figure out

261
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,680
what's happening.

262
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,080
So even in the case of, let's say, Twitter or Facebook, we had to, to carve through and

263
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,720
look at, you know, what was interesting and what wasn't interesting and, and one of the

264
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,600
ones that, that really ultimately came, turned out to be very predictive was the median

265
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,920
level of engagement, uh, you know, per, per athlete.

266
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,840
And I guess that would be for anybody on Twitter, but like the median level of likes, the

267
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,400
median level of, of, uh, uh, uh, retweets, and the reason why median is so important is

268
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:22,960
that if you look at just, you know, you just took necessarily, um, all of them, you get

269
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,000
these outliers and it just blows up the data set, um, because there are sometimes somebody

270
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,320
gets lucky and they get like a giant retweet.

271
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,320
And it's like, ah, that just does not indicative of, of really their normal performance.

272
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,320
Right.

273
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,440
Um, so that's one part of it, uh, that, and then, and then also trying to strengthen the

274
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:46,000
signal by finding other sources like, for example, I, I eventually stumbled upon Wikipedia

275
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,560
and realized that, wow, that this is a, well, in general, I would say, I'm amazed that

276
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,960
more people don't use Wikipedia as a data source.

277
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,560
It's just amazing, but, but definitely correlates very strongly with, um, Twitter and Facebook.

278
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,880
And so if you look at, uh, Wikipedia page views and you look at Twitter engagement, Facebook

279
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
and engagement, they're very correlated.

280
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,720
And so, meaning, if you're looking at influencers on Twitter and Facebook that also have Wikipedia

281
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,960
pages about them, that you can correlate them.

282
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:12,960
Okay.

283
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,320
And, and, and, and so those are all plugging into the model.

284
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:22,640
And, um, the other part that's, again, one of these cold syrup type or, or real world,

285
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,640
I would say it's cold.

286
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,560
I guess, yeah, it's a combination of cold syrup and real world problems is that, um, it

287
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:34,720
is non-trivial to get, you know, let's say a thousand, um, social media handles, right?

288
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,720
I mean, you, you have, you have, um, athletes, for example, that have the same name.

289
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:45,360
So Anthony Davis is one of the stars in India right now for the Pelicans and there was

290
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,400
it one period of time at Anthony Davis and the NFL.

291
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,640
And so it's, it's, even in intern would get tripped up by that.

292
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,520
And so that was a very, very significant problem in that, you know, you're just going to get

293
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:04,400
garbage results if you don't have really high quality control around the inputs that are

294
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,040
going into your collection.

295
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:13,440
So, um, that, one of the ways that we solve that was ultimately, we landed upon mechanical

296
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,440
jerk.

297
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,560
And so what we did was we created these mechanical jerk jobs that would, um, ask, let's say

298
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:25,520
nine people who they thought the social media handles were Twitter handle, Facebook handle,

299
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,840
Wikipedia handle.

300
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,680
And let's say if seven of the nine agreed, I think that's what we figured out was like

301
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:35,240
a good number for the quorum, then we would, we would select that handle and feed that

302
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,440
into our job collection system, which would then go out and collect the raw data.

303
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,840
And, and then even that part of the problem is another significant problem is that, um,

304
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,920
you know, Twitter APIs will blow up on you, uh, you know, you get rate throttling, Facebook

305
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,760
APIs will blow up on you, you know, you get bad data.

306
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:02,280
So, um, again, the real world part of it is it ultimately, it took maybe like a year

307
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:09,320
to really get something with the jobs framework, the collection system, uh, you know, we're

308
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:16,280
able to accurately, you know, get the handles and, and regularly, you know, run, run our

309
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,160
collection algorithms.

310
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:21,600
And then, and then all that was, again, about a year.

311
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,960
And so the, the whole 80, 20 thing of, you know, cleaning the data and collecting it takes

312
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,560
all, it's for me is absolutely the truth in the real world.

313
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,360
I'd say even longer than the model, uh, training the model was almost nothing.

314
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,360
Wow.

315
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:40,760
And so the model output was, it was a, it was a predictor of the number of page use specifically

316
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,240
or some intermediate page use.

317
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,800
So basically, we could, we could at that point, um, feed in all those signals and figure

318
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,080
out very accurately, uh, forget off the top of my head what the root mean squared error

319
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,600
was, but, um, we had a pretty low root mean squared error and we, you, you basically knew

320
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,800
exactly if you partnered with this person that give you, let's say, a thousand page use

321
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
for posts.

322
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
Huh.

323
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Interesting.

324
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Yeah.

325
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,560
And then what's great about that is, is that I don't know if it's changed, I've been out

326
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,000
of the VC game for a little bit, but, you know, if you look at, um, cost per, uh, cost per

327
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
user, you know, we're getting users at like 80 cents a user.

328
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Okay.

329
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,760
So you could back that into a cost per acquisition, cost per user and then use that as part

330
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,120
of your, your fundraising and all that kind of stuff.

331
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
Exactly.

332
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,160
I mean, if you say users worth 40 to 80 bucks or whatever, you know, it's like, hey, we

333
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:35,600
can acquire them for a dollar and then, you know, every dollar you put in is, it's a 40

334
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,040
time to 80 time return depending on, you know, how you value users.

335
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,040
Hmm.

336
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,800
And so you, you went on from working on, uh, this kind of, uh, growth hacking type of

337
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:55,600
application of machine learning and AI to developing some or at least, you know, starting

338
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:01,800
to think through ways that you could more, uh, apply a machine learning and AI kind of

339
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,240
more to the core of the company's products.

340
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Is that right?

341
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,240
Yeah.

342
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,120
So then once, once we realized that we really were on to something, uh, then we started

343
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,160
to turn it into something we call it athlete intelligent dashboard.

344
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:20,920
And we were on the, in the process of, uh, and we had some, some preliminary, like kind

345
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,840
of beta tools that were dashboards that an athlete or a team could look at and they

346
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,840
would show them, they would be able to see similar information to the information that

347
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,080
we used for growth hacking.

348
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,000
So they could, they could see, you know, in relative terms, how did, how does their team

349
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,280
or how does their athlete or their whole roster of athletes, how did, how do they compare

350
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,640
and social media, like, what do they rank, um, how many page views would they give in

351
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,240
a, in a campaign, uh, who are their fans, what are some demographic information?

352
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,280
And then as we started to sell things, we were also linking in, um, sales data.

353
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:59,040
So, you know, what's, how many, how many, how many items could this, uh, athlete or team

354
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,040
sell?

355
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,960
You know, if, if there's, uh, a product that they're endorsing.

356
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Okay.

357
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,240
And then when we spoke, uh, prior to starting the show, you mentioned, uh, at least I

358
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,640
took the note as, uh, doing some work to predict the best players based on their fans, social

359
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,640
media engagement.

360
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,040
Were you speaking of best in terms of best performing from a kind of marketing influence

361
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:26,400
or perspective, or was there a crossover to actual player on the field performance based

362
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,080
on their fan engagement?

363
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,080
Yeah.

364
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,720
So, uh, after, after the startup, you know, unfortunately, you know, ran out of cash

365
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,960
and, and some business deals that work out and, and, and I left, um, and ultimately they

366
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
don't exist anymore.

367
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:45,480
Uh, I, I still was thinking about the problem because it was a, it was a really interesting

368
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
problem.

369
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,880
And over the last year, as I've decided to write a book on this, I'm not exactly a hundred

370
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,880
percent the subject, but I, I was digging into it more and more.

371
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,880
And one of the, the, the areas that I was interested in was, is that social media was

372
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,080
able to predict, you know, basically, uh, how many page views somebody could give to a

373
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:11,240
platform and how many products, but I was curious whether it could also predict how good

374
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,240
a player was.

375
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,440
And, in fact, even predict, um, you know, winning, winning like, like, uh, how, you know,

376
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
how many wins a player could bring to the team.

377
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:27,360
And so, I've spent, I would say several months on this this year and the preliminary information

378
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:33,640
I have is very promising and that some of the conclusions so far are that it does appear

379
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:40,400
that in the NBA that, that, that owners will play, uh, will pay, um, versus points.

380
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,160
And so anybody that's, uh, a basketball, um, statistics person knows that points are

381
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,520
not, I mean, they're, they're, they're, they're a reasonable predictor of, of winning and,

382
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,360
um, you know, play, uh, play up performance, things like that, but, but there's a lot more

383
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
to it.

384
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,920
So players will be paid by, uh, in general by the owners, but, you know, something like

385
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,200
about a point, a million point.

386
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,680
So if you, you know, 10 points a game, you make 10 million, but, but if you really dig

387
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:13,880
into it, uh, one of the best measures of, of how productive a player is is wins over, essentially

388
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,680
the wins over replacement or, um, I think it's wins, RPM.

389
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,000
So how many wins are attributable specifically to you?

390
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,720
And off the top of my head, I think LeBron James, for example, is a, is a perfect, you

391
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,440
know, like, an outlier in that, I think it's something like 23 or 25 games, just, you

392
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:37,120
know, there's what 70 something games in the NBA and just LeBron James himself to the

393
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,880
Cleveland Cavaliers is like 23 games.

394
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,800
So he basically puts them in the playoffs just here, you know, and, um, what, uh, so what

395
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:52,920
I, what I was digging into was, well, do fans engage more highly with, um, uh, players

396
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:59,000
who have high points or, or players who have, um, you know, better, let's say, say, overall

397
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,480
performance like wins, like wins RPM.

398
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,760
And it does appear that the, that fans, and, you know, but I have, I don't have enough

399
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,920
data to do, to collect this and maybe if somebody wants to hire me to do a year project

400
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:17,360
on, I would dig more, but it does appear that, um, that, that fans are, are actually really

401
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,480
good judges in terms of, they like to engage with the best players and, and, and, and if,

402
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,080
if you look at, you know, they're, they're engaging lesser with the hype, the high point.

403
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,760
I mean, they're obviously engaging them, but if, if you look at, if you plot, uh, you

404
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:38,360
know, wins over replacement versus points, you can see the fans more, uh, are more engaged

405
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,720
with the true players who are, who are, um, contributing to their overall team's performance.

406
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:49,240
So the, I guess the takeaways there, again, this is still pretty, pretty, preliminary

407
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:54,640
and it's possible I'm, I'm making something in accurate conclusions, but the takeaways

408
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,440
are that, you know, you could start to feed this into, um, uh, you know, better, you know,

409
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,640
algorithms, for example, or, uh, fantasy, you know, you know, you know, fantasy team and,

410
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,440
and, uh, I think it's pretty fascinating again that if you just look at Wikipedia, you

411
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,600
know, it's got this free data set for you, and it's got this incredible power to show

412
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,200
you that, you know, that, that even with the page views, like, if you look at page views,

413
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,160
that, that it appears that, that the best players in terms of the true metrics, like, uh,

414
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:32,120
Windsor PM, they get, they get higher page views, and if you look at points, hmm.

415
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,320
And do you, is this a, is this something that you think might be, you know, granted your

416
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,680
early in, in the research here, but is this something that you think might be usable as

417
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:47,560
a leading indicator, meaning helping teams find the next LeBron James or someone who's

418
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:53,360
undervalued relative to what they're being paid now and help them kind of, uh, you

419
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,800
know, take advantage of that kind of information in, uh, draft type of situations or scouting

420
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:05,720
types of situations or is it more, um, you know, what's happening in, you know, Wikipedia

421
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,560
social media is an indication of what's happening now and, and not necessarily, you know, having

422
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,560
predictive value.

423
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:16,160
No, I think it could be a leading indicator and let's, let's take kind of a greater, for

424
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
example.

425
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:25,560
So, um, I will readily admit, uh, I've been a, been a, I would say a, uh, someone new

426
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:32,160
fan to, um, to, to MMA and UFC, and, you know, part of it was working at the company,

427
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:36,480
but I remember when Conor McGregor came out and thought, ah, you know, this, this guy's

428
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,960
a showboat, you know, he's, he's going to get destroyed eventually, but the fans, if

429
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,000
you look at the engagement, they must have known something because, um, the, the engagement

430
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,960
level was just incredible in relative terms.

431
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:55,840
And so I do think there's something there where, you know, the collective wisdom of fans

432
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:02,160
who really know this local athlete that really, really, really, it says something like, like,

433
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,240
they know something that other people don't know.

434
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,320
And so it, in a way, I think it's a signal that absolutely you could use, and again, this

435
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:13,640
would be a really fascinating project, it's to look at, let's say NFL drafts and, and

436
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:18,080
look at the local engagement for, let's say, uh, players.

437
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:23,840
And if you, instead of looking at these BS stats like, you know, the four yard dash and

438
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,480
all these things that they've shown that I have very little correlations to successfully

439
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:32,960
NFL, I'd be interested if you plotted that against their social media engagement.

440
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:37,840
If you would then show if that's predictive of their future success in NFL, again, just

441
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,920
a theory, but I, but I, I have suspicions that there's something there.

442
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:48,680
Are there players that are that have kind of an outsized social media impact that doesn't

443
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:55,040
correlate to wins or performance like the exact opposite of, you know, what we're speculating

444
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:01,480
about now, um, a player that, you know, has, you know, super high social media engagement

445
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:08,320
and, and potentially as a result of that hat brings super, you know, high value to a team

446
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,720
from a kind of marketing and, and audience engagement perspective, but isn't necessarily

447
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,520
a winning or high scoring player, does that kind of scenario ring any bells?

448
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,800
Yeah, I mean, I could, I could see how you could maybe do some clustering and you could,

449
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:28,320
you could, you could maybe even classification, like you could, you could say there's, let's

450
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,920
just, off the top of my head, just, just kind of brainstorming here, but like you, you

451
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:38,080
have Tim Tibo cluster, you know, like, where, like super, super engaged fans, but turns

452
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,480
out, not that good.

453
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:45,060
And then you have, um, and then you have another cluster, which is that super, super engaged

454
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:49,520
fans that turns out that they're actually, uh, above average, like significantly above

455
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,520
average.

456
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,520
So, right.

457
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,920
Yeah, I think there is some, there is some probably some, you know, there's a BCG matrix

458
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:01,720
here that's like your, your popular winners, your popular losers, your, um, popular losers

459
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:07,160
that you need to get rid of and then your, uh, your winners that are unpopular that maybe

460
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,120
are your, I don't know what you, what the cute names you would assign to these quadrants

461
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,720
are, but, you know, maybe those year, you know, hidden gems are undervalued folks or

462
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,920
something like that that you need to figure out how to, you know, engage with, with fans

463
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,920
or something.

464
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
Yeah.

465
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Yeah.

466
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,520
I, I, there's definitely, you know, there's definitely something there and it's surprising

467
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,360
that, uh, I have not heard more about it.

468
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,360
Hmm.

469
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
Yeah.

470
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,520
I, you know, I have, I have said on the podcast before that I'm not the, the biggest sports

471
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:42,800
fan, uh, at all, our producer is a huge sports fan and so we, uh, have, have some interesting

472
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:50,040
plans to do, uh, some conversations around how machine learning and NAI apply to sports.

473
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:57,880
But I, I will say that my appreciation for sports, you know, multiplied by, you know,

474
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,520
who knows how many orders of magnitudes after reading money ball.

475
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:06,240
I thought that, that, you know, the treatment of, um, Billy Bean and the A's and kind of

476
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,040
understanding how he used this insight about a particular metric was being undervalued

477
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:19,320
by the marketplace and really changed the way folks, staff, baseball teams, um, that

478
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
was amazing.

479
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,320
That was fantastic.

480
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:28,280
Well, it's, and I, I'm not 100% sure how much I could talk about this, but, uh, there,

481
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:34,480
I'll, I'll just, I'll say in rough terms that there was a company that were, you know,

482
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,480
I knew of from when I used to play pickup basketball at Caltech, um, with, with the founder

483
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,400
and, um, he was working with some teams, the NBA and also with NFL and they, they, they

484
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:53,160
were looking at motion tracking data and, and actually they had algorithms that gave

485
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:58,600
teams insights like, uh, the center in the fourth quarter is going to just be horrible.

486
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,800
So go out of, you know, or, you know, it, it, take, this player has a horrible left hand

487
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:10,800
and so, um, basically make them go left and, and I won't, I won't say what's teams or,

488
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,360
I don't know if I'm supposed to say it or not.

489
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,520
So I'll just, I'll just leave it, but, but they're definitely are, they're definitely

490
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,680
are, um, they're, this is happening, um, in sports and there are people that are using

491
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,280
machine learning, uh, especially on like things like motion tracking data and they do have

492
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,800
some, some secret information that I'm sure is playing a, a role in the amount of wins

493
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,800
they have.

494
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,920
And so, you know, I think you can make an argument for teams, let's say the NBA because

495
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:42,600
I have some, a little bit of information that maybe some of the teams that, even we can

496
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:48,120
think of off the top of our head, um, that, that have a lot of wins may have some secrets

497
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:54,240
that, that, that, uh, they have algorithms that, that let them have insights that other

498
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,240
teams don't have.

499
00:34:55,240 --> 00:35:01,400
And so there, there's a little bit of a, um, uh, a race, I guess, uh, I don't, I don't

500
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,720
have all the info, but, but I know a little bit.

501
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,280
Yeah, you've got to imagine that, uh, you know, the popularization and money ball, if

502
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,240
it wasn't already kind of an open secret, the data can make a difference in sports, you

503
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:19,880
know, that kind of blew the top off and, uh, now that, uh, machine learning has become

504
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:25,600
so much more accessible, um, you've got to imagine that any owner or general manager

505
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:32,720
kind of worth their salt is at least experimenting with, um, how to apply this both on the field,

506
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,200
on the court, as well as in terms of the business, uh, ticket sales and advertising and all

507
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
that kind of stuff.

508
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:44,600
Yeah, well, and, and so that was, that, that, that actually does lead to a, uh, other area

509
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,440
that I was doing a little bit of research on that again, I, I'm, you know, how, I would

510
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,120
love to do more research on is how is the valuation of a team set, uh, and what's interesting

511
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:59,960
is in the NBA, for example, uh, the two most valued teams are the Los Angeles Lakers

512
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,720
and the New York Knicks, uh, each are, we're several billion dollars.

513
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,640
And if you look at their, their, their, um, records, I think the lake is a little better

514
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,640
this year.

515
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,480
But if you look at their records the last few years, it's, I mean, they're, they're

516
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
very bad.

517
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,480
I mean, very bad.

518
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,560
And, and what's interesting is that attendance really doesn't seem to be affected by this

519
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:20,560
evaluate.

520
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,960
And, and then if you dig into it, it's, you know, what, what are the things that predict

521
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,000
the most, uh, valuations of a team and it, it's actually pretty boring so far as like,

522
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,160
you know, things like what's the meeting home price and what's the population density?

523
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
Yeah.

524
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,680
So my immediate market size when you mention those two teams.

525
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,680
Yeah.

526
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:42,360
So like if you live in a major metropolitan area with high real estate values, you're going

527
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,760
to have a highly, highly valued team.

528
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,800
And so in a way, uh, maybe, and I, I, I don't know how long, I know the clippers, for

529
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,360
example, I don't, I forget how long Donald's stringing on them, but they've for so long

530
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,680
were just a horrible team.

531
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,480
I mean, I mean, just one of the worst teams in the NBA, but I guess if you're just strictly

532
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,680
talking about, um, an investment, yet maybe it doesn't even pay, uh, in terms of valuation

533
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:12,720
to do anything because if you're in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, you, and you're just

534
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,200
there, you, you will just make money and people will show up.

535
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,600
They have a losing suck.

536
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:22,600
So you want to try to help fly some of this stuff to try to figure out how to win.

537
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,200
If you're going to have to show up every day, you might as well try to win at least.

538
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,200
Yeah.

539
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,080
Well, I, I, I do wonder though if there's some teams like that are like that where they

540
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,400
just, they just, they, it's an investment or vanity thing and they just, I mean, like

541
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,840
the clippers come to mind if you, you know, if you, you, you've been a NBA fan, like, there

542
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,240
was a period for like 10 or 20 years, I think, where they're in Los Angeles and you're

543
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,840
like, how, how can you be this bad?

544
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,520
It's like you're trying to be this bad.

545
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,320
But I guess if you look at the, the clippers when they were sold, there was a, um, pretty

546
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,320
substantial profit.

547
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:59,960
And so, yeah, that, that, that, that's kind of another, yeah, like sports equivalent of

548
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:04,600
like a self storage facility, it's like it, yeah, this is our parking lot.

549
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:09,000
It's like, those are real estate play, it has nothing to do with, uh, actually providing

550
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
the service.

551
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Yeah.

552
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,680
So, so yeah, I think, I think the, the, the more interesting part of the story, maybe

553
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:20,240
that if you look at, um, and I, and I have some, uh, in, in the talk of it, I, I showed

554
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,000
some 3D graphs about this.

555
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,440
But like if you look at some of the cheaper teams, like, uh, I don't know, Dallas or Houston,

556
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,080
and, and you can, you can look at those and go, you know, if you were rich enough to buy

557
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:36,040
a team, like, that's maybe where you'd want to buy a team is somewhere where they have

558
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,840
lots of wins, but they're, they're very, very low valued versus, if, again, if you cared

559
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:46,920
about performance, but if you just wanted to make a real estate play, then, yeah, try to

560
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,920
buy, buy low it in, in Los Angeles or, or New York, um, uh, so we've talked about a bunch

561
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:58,440
of, uh, ideas along these lines, uh, but I'm curious if you've got, uh, if you've got

562
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,560
others in mind, if you're a data scientist practicing hobbyist, whatever, and you're

563
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:12,840
also interested in sports, uh, what are some areas that you think are ripe for, you

564
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,640
know, experimentation and research?

565
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,960
What do you think folks could go in and have some fun and, and maybe, you know, make an

566
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,960
interesting difference?

567
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,240
Yeah, so I, I do have some off the top of my head. Um, in the last five years, in particular,

568
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:31,720
I've really gotten into Brazilian Jitsu and, um, got me really interested more in the

569
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:37,280
UFC, which is because of Brazilian Jitsu is a pretty big component of it. And, uh, one

570
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,800
of things that does seem like it's massively ripe for, uh, data scientists, hobbyist, data

571
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:50,200
scientists is the, um, machine learning around, um, things like, uh, submissions, for example.

572
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:56,880
So, you know, uh, what's really interesting is that if you just look and you plot the

573
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:02,360
submissions, uh, for the last 20 years, I think I have a project right at this. They're,

574
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:09,360
the career naked choke is number one, one, then, I don't know, it's like arm bar and, uh,

575
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:14,600
a triangle, you know, a leg triangle are, are, you know, coming next. But what's really

576
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:19,960
I think could be very interesting is, is, is the chain effective. It, is it, is a

577
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:25,040
rear naked choke, the best high percentage, um, submission because you started with that

578
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:29,400
or, or did you start with a bunch of other submissions? And so I, I think there could

579
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,760
be, uh, a lot of interesting things that could happen in terms of, you know, what, what,

580
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,720
what are the chain of submissions that someone would try, uh, and, and are there sequences,

581
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:45,440
like almost like a, a Pac-Man game. I don't know if you remember the 80s. There was, uh,

582
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,800
maybe I'm too old, but, um, for people to remember this, but there, there, what, I remember

583
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:54,320
when I was a little kid and, and I used to play Pac-Man. I bought this book. There was

584
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,240
like, how to cheat at Pac-Man. And there was literally a screen that you went through.

585
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:03,680
And then you could beat every, every screen for a while. Right. And I could, I could think,

586
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,520
I, I could see how in the same thing with Jiu-Jitsu out, maybe there's, there's some moves

587
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:13,520
that work in certain situations and, uh, sorry, it seems like there's, like, those at the

588
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,040
Konami Code, like, up, up, down, down. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. So I, I'll be very curious if,

589
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,240
like, if that, that's, that's one area, um, you know, another one too would, would just

590
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,920
be some of the really interesting statistics that have been generated. Another sports,

591
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:34,120
like baseball and NBA because they're so popular, you know, those, those things haven't really

592
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:40,880
been applied to, um, the UFC or Belator, these, these mixed martial arts forums. And so,

593
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,760
you know, even from a financial perspective, uh, I could imagine there could be a lot of

594
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,480
money made by somebody going in and, and really figuring out, you know, who is the best

595
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,960
player or who are the best fighters in the UFC and who are, you know, what are the best

596
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,400
techniques and, um, yeah, I, I think that in particular, there's a, is a, is a, is a

597
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,520
very interesting one. Um, I also think in terms of, um, other sports, like track and field,

598
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:12,560
I think are, are, are, are also, um, there's, there's some things that, if I was independently

599
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,280
wealthy, I would pursue, like, one of them is, like, what is the optimal amount of training

600
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,080
and what's the best periodization schedule for, let's say track athletes, like a 400 meter

601
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:27,160
runner or a 200 meter runner. And I, I, I think there's a lot of, uh, ground that can

602
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:33,800
be covered in, I guess the way I would classify it as like a, a ways for fitness where you,

603
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,080
you have something that's constantly telling you the right thing to do. And, and the thing

604
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:42,280
that's interesting about the human body is that there, it, it, it's, it's not a linear

605
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,560
relationship. Like, oh, I just exercise more and then I get better. There, there, there,

606
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,040
there's these really complex things that are happening. And, and that's why periodization

607
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,720
is, is so effective as, you know, you do, let's say, a, a really, a strength cycle in,

608
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,360
in, in track, for example, and then go on and during cycle. And, and so I, I think that's

609
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:05,600
a period that's a, that's a, um, an area where, where machine learning artificial intelligence

610
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:12,360
can, can play a, a really significant role. And it hasn't, to my knowledge, there, there

611
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:17,760
hasn't been a lot of traction there. Interesting. I did an interview with, uh, with

612
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,680
Ilka Corjonan, who is a technology VP at first beat, which is the company who, like, they

613
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:31,680
have their, their models embedded into a lot of the fitness watches, um, for like, doing

614
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:36,520
analytics on the heartbeat and the heartbeat rate, but they're, but the heartbeat interval,

615
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:43,200
uh, forget the, the name of the specific acronym. But they do, in addition to their business

616
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:50,320
where they sell these, you know, models and IP to the watchmakers, they also have this,

617
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:56,160
like pro athlete training or insight or whatever business where they will apply that data

618
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,240
to, like that, I think their stuff is what allows a lot of the watchmakers to now produce,

619
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:10,120
like, VO2 max and, and, um, some of these, uh, some of these other metrics off of the

620
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,600
heart rate data from the watches. And the VO2 max, I think, has something to do with,

621
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:20,800
like, training and rest intervals and stuff like that. Um, so if anyone wants to take on

622
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:26,600
that challenge, check out, uh, twomal talk number one, oh, six, uh, any other ideas?

623
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:32,800
You know, I think, I think the other one that's, I guess, somewhat, somewhat related is,

624
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:38,240
is just in terms of, um, nutrition as well. So my, my background, my undergraduate

625
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:42,880
degrees in nutritional science, and I still haven't let go of, of a lot of ideas that I

626
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,400
learned. And I, I think another one, again, is, is that I have not seen this yet as,

627
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,960
is machine learning around nutrition. And the closest I've seen is, there's some longitudinal

628
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:59,360
studies that came out last several years about, I think it was, there's a nurse study

629
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:05,280
that was 20 or 30 year period where they, they, they showed the predictive power of, of a food

630
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:11,520
in terms of how much weight you would have. So if you, if you eat more, um, yogurts, you

631
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,080
over a five year period, the more servings of yogurt, you eat the, the lower your body

632
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:19,520
weight, the more servings of, um, not to eat the lower your body weight, the more servings

633
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,160
of coke, uh, chips, the higher your body weight. And, and so I could see a, again, from just

634
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:30,520
athletes and just regular people that, um, you know, you could, you could basically have

635
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:36,360
something that's constantly, again, very non intuitive. And I think this is where AI

636
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,920
comes in. You could, you could, you could basically constantly be telling someone, you,

637
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,720
you can, you could actually have forecast, like, you could forecast based on what somebody's

638
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,080
eating, what they're going to weigh. Right. And so it's certainly not counting calories.

639
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,880
You're not, you're, you're literally just telling someone constantly like, yeah, here's

640
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,760
your, here's your forecast for a year from now based on what I, what I've seen you doing.

641
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:01,600
So if you want the forecast to go down, you know, you need to be, there's four, here's

642
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:07,840
four choices. Interesting. Interesting. That makes me think of, um, you know, it'd be cool

643
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:14,400
to have an app that like you just, and I've seen when, when we were at the peak of the

644
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,520
quantified self thing, I've seen versions of this, but I don't think they had the AI stuff

645
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:25,840
on the back end and access to all the center data. But an app where you just rate kind

646
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:31,760
of how you feel on, you know, a handful of dimensions, like physically, mentally, whatever,

647
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:39,480
happiness. And then it looks at your historical rating patterns, your sleep patterns from

648
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:44,000
your watch or other, you know, sensors, pillow sensors that they're selling now, all that

649
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:51,840
kind of stuff, your diet that you put into, uh, your tracking app and just tells you,

650
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,880
you know what, this spaghetti is going to taste really good, but you're going to be

651
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:00,720
crabby as hell tomorrow or whatever. Um, and just make some simple predictions based on

652
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,640
that or, you know, you're, you know, it's, it's 1130. You, you want to stay up until half

653
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,880
an hour to work on this project or finish this movie or something like that, but you're

654
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:16,400
going to feel like crap tomorrow. Yeah, I, I, I do think that is the future of AI and

655
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,000
those are the kind of things that I personally am interested in for this next decade of

656
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
my life is, is that, that AI assistant where, where it, there are things that are not

657
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,160
easily thought about. The brain is, there's just not good at. And I think things like health,

658
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:36,840
nutrition, sleep, all, you know, driving, all there's, there's all, there's all these things

659
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:41,960
where, where algorithms can do it better. So I, I do think that's going to actually be

660
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,280
a significant, uh, impact on humanity in a positive way.

661
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:55,720
Mm, mm, awesome. Uh, before I let you go, if I may, uh, you are in the final stages of

662
00:47:55,720 --> 00:48:01,080
getting a book out the door, is that right? Yeah. So I, I spent about the last year working

663
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:08,600
on a book called, uh, Pragmatic AI. Um, and the premise of the book is that, that there's

664
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:14,360
a lot of AI, like, like many of the conversations we had here that, that is, is very straightforward

665
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:21,560
and practical and that it should just be done versus, uh, AI is not just self-driving cars

666
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:28,280
that are fully autonomous and addition that, uh, the cloud plays a big role in, um, in, in

667
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,760
getting things into production. When are you expecting that to hit the shelves?

668
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:38,440
I think it's June. So I, I'm in technical review this week. So then it goes into production. So,

669
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:43,880
yeah, I think, I think June, I believe, is when it gets on the shelves. And is it, uh, hands-on,

670
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:50,120
practical coding kind of book or, you know, this is the opportunity, landscape, higher-level

671
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:56,600
kind of book? No, super, super hands-on. So, uh, there's examples of, um, doing, you know,

672
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,920
for example, the social media stuff we talked about, there's, there's a whole exploration with code

673
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:07,080
on that. Um, there's, uh, how to analyze the GitHub project and figure out, you know, what's wrong

674
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:14,760
with your team. Um, and then there's solutions for AWS, um, Azure, uh, Google Cloud,

675
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:20,840
TPUs, like, so yeah, very, very, um, hands-on with code examples, mostly in Python, there's a little

676
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:27,320
bit of R and a lot of Jupyter notebooks. Okay. Oh, very cool. Uh, well, I will, uh, keep an eye out

677
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:33,880
for that. But I appreciate you taking the time to, to jump on the call and to, to chat with you.

678
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:38,200
I enjoyed, uh, enjoyed learning about what you're up to. Yeah. Thank you so much for inviting me,

679
