Welcome to the Twimal AI Podcast.

2
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,200
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:32,120
All right, everyone. I am pleased to be here with Eric Topol. Eric is Professor of Molecular

4
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:37,680
Medicine at Scripps Research, as well as the Director and Founder of the Scripps Research

5
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,920
Translational Institute. Eric, welcome to the Twimal AI Podcast.

6
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,600
Thanks very much, Sam. Great to be with you.

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,680
I am really excited to have you on the show. I've been a fan of your Twitter feed for

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,760
quite some time. You have been one of the resources that I've tended to turn to to try to understand

9
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,560
the COVID-19 and coronavirus situation as it's been evolving. So thank you very much for

10
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:10,800
that. I'm really looking forward to digging into talking about your perspective on that.

11
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,440
But before we do, I'd love to have you share a little bit about your background. You're

12
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,240
trained as a cardiologist if I'm correct. I imagine that a lot of cardiologists have their

13
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,280
time well full studying the heart, but you've managed to really dig into the role that technology

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:34,440
plays in medicine and in particular, artificial intelligence. How did that all come about?

15
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:41,160
Well, it's interesting how I got into this, Sam. Back in college, I was in genetics. The

16
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:48,280
major, and I always loved that area, but I drifted to cardiology, got into the interventional

17
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:53,440
that is putting its stems and balloons, arteries, and whatnot. But I mostly got back to the

18
00:01:53,440 --> 00:02:01,840
genetics in the mid-90s to try to understand why people had heart attacks or heart disease.

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:10,560
And then, when I got to San Diego in 2006, I started up this new institute. I realized genetics

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,680
wasn't going to do enough. We needed sensors and other layers of data to understand each

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,840
person. And that led to the total kind of digital medicine, the interest. And then became pretty

22
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,640
natural that if you have a genome and you have continuous sensor data, you need some advanced

23
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,400
analytics to really understand what's going on. So that's kind of the progression how it

24
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:40,600
all came to pass. That is understanding each person who is unique in every layer of biology,

25
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:48,320
physiology, their environment, and anatomy. So this is kind of the story how it's unfolded.

26
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:57,520
Great. So in terms of COVID-19 and coronavirus, at least as far as the work from home and

27
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:03,560
quarantines and all that goes, many of us are recently passing a hundred days in for

28
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:09,280
folks that have been studying it closely. We're quite a bit beyond that in terms of it's

29
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,880
having been on the scene. Maybe we can start by having you share a little bit of your

30
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:20,960
take on kind of where we are with our understanding of the disease and how that's evolved over

31
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,520
the past few months. It's been amazing really how six months time we've learned quite a bit

32
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:34,560
and still every day we learn more. So at first it was built as a respiratory virus. And then

33
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,800
we learned that because it goes after the ACE2 receptor, it actually goes to many different

34
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:48,320
organs, especially the heart, kidneys, and to some extent, pancreatic and brain liver. So it turned

35
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:56,960
out that what was just a lung disease became complete body potential for this virus to have

36
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:03,440
its impact. And so the other thing that kind of been shocking is the spectrum here that you can

37
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:11,760
have people 30% or more who experience no symptoms whatsoever. And then you have 1% or less

38
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,960
that it can be fatal. So it's quite a spectrum. And then you know people who are this without

39
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:26,800
symptom group up to a half may even have internal damage or hurt that they don't even know about.

40
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:34,720
So for example with lung CT scan in four different series we've seen this evidence of lung effects

41
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:41,360
that they had no idea they had symptoms. So this is a really challenging virus. No wonder we

42
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:50,960
have a global pandemic because it is unique. It's a stealth spread but it can be fatal. And the

43
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,080
other thing I think that's becoming more evidence than the recent weeks is the cornicity issue.

44
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,640
A lot of people don't get fully recovered can linger for a long time. That may be part of the

45
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:09,840
immunologic reaction why people feel really washed out and you still have problems with breathing

46
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,440
and other issues. And so we're just starting to learn about that and not of course discouraging too.

47
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:24,960
Early on as the disease emerged and the scientific community and in particular the data science

48
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,480
and machine learning community heard about this. You know lots of folks wanted to jump in and

49
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:38,000
help understand this and people really struggle to make sense of data. I think my sense is that

50
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,280
we're still struggling. There are still lots of different representations, lots of challenges

51
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,760
with getting clean data but I'm curious your take on how data has impacted our understanding

52
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:55,600
of the disease in particular and what we've learned in the past six months.

53
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,720
Well we have learned in the United States does them have very good arms around their data

54
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,200
and that's been a more challenging. So most countries where there's a national data

55
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:15,440
dashboard we have nothing. The CDC basically didn't show up and there is this bootstrapping

56
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,640
COVID-19 tracking project that was developed by the Atlantic and volunteers and that's actually

57
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,760
collecting the data going to 56 different websites every day to try to call the number of people

58
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,760
who are tested at the results and whatever they can get which is limited. So we don't know at any

59
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,400
given moment how many people are in the ICU, how many ICU beds are available in hospitals and

60
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,560
you know the demographics and so many things. We just have a sense that the people were affected,

61
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,560
infected, have shifted to a younger group since the reopening started to begin but we're in a

62
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,320
country that's leading the epicenter of this pandemic and it just shows you how we don't have

63
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:07,120
the data, the input. You've got some real powerful output. Are you finding that are there any

64
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:14,800
particular analyses that you've seen emerged that you're finding particularly helpful in understanding

65
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,600
the epidemic? Well one of the most impressive things is that during this surge that started

66
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:29,040
you know in mid-June in the US where we have this extraordinary steep slope of new cases. Now you know

67
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:35,280
well 40,000 and even today during testimony Tony Fauci mentioned it could get up to 100,000

68
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,280
but today we keep seeing a reduction in the death rate which is an incredible divergence

69
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:50,400
that's poorly understood. That could just represent a significant lag. It also could represent

70
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,720
that younger people are affected and they're now showing up in hospitals more and they may take

71
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,000
time to see that or for that to reverberate in their own communities but because of not having

72
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,760
data we're more hampered. We're compromised and understanding having an absolute analysis of

73
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,920
at a macro level that's quite important. Yeah. You've also been involved in some of the efforts

74
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:23,680
around contact tracing and wearables and other technological interventions to you know both

75
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,520
understand and treat maybe you can give us a lay of the land of you know what's what's happening

76
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,520
there. Starting with contact tracing and some of the the applications and implications.

77
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:41,440
Yeah so it's interesting contact tracing is being used now in many countries but it hasn't

78
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:50,160
been validated and so it requires a large portion of the people in that country or place to use it

79
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,280
but also because it can generate false positives it could create lots of issues on privacy and

80
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:04,800
confusion and so it's alluring from a clever technical standpoint of using smartphone

81
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,280
chirps to help alert people and try to prevent spread and as you well know we don't have enough

82
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:17,280
human contact tracing people so it could be a booster but it remained

83
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,000
unvalidated and has privacy concerns. Well we've been working with this digital surveillance

84
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,480
music smartwatches or fitness wristband and we have almost 40,000 people now in the US where we're

85
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,600
getting their continuous heart rate physical activity and they have it on during sleep we have

86
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,160
that both metrics and we already are seeing signals that we may be able to pick up

87
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,520
the cluster of people so we have all 50 states covered and as we get more and more people in

88
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,240
in hundreds of thousands and not millions we hopefully can stay ahead of the pandemic because

89
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:04,640
you hear task task tests but you can't test 330 million people no less once one off but on

90
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:12,160
our frequent basis so the digital continuous with recurrent neural network analytics to understand

91
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:19,520
where and when there may be a burden cluster and then do guided testing and conflict tracing

92
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,080
and isolation that we think could turn out to be a way to start to get some control of

93
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:33,680
an unambated unbridled or increasing cases which is accompanied now by increase in hospitalizations

94
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,160
in the state where this has been chiefly occurring. So this system that you're working on it's

95
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,600
not about contact tracing but about identifying the disease and individuals preemptively based

96
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,240
on different signals you're able to pick up from the smartwatches and fitness meters.

97
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,520
Right we have done that work with flu a flu like I almost published in

98
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:06,640
earlier this year that we could pick up flu throughout five states exclusively well better than

99
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:14,880
other CDC methods of today earlier and as accurate. So the hope is that we can use that but there

100
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:21,680
are other alternatives for there's some akinza smart thermometer that's out there in more

101
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,120
than a million Americans that take their temperature each day at least one and that's been helpful

102
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,360
to localize the tensile cluster there's also you know things like the URA rain which has got

103
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:40,560
lots of metrics that it captures through the rain chips inside the interlining so

104
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,560
orthogonal data from many sources could be helpful but the reason why we picked the smartwatches

105
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:53,120
we had published data and because a hundred million people in the US already have a fitness

106
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,080
band or a smartwatch so it's passive and we could get a large number quickly and of course

107
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:08,160
they relies on AI analytics to help localize where there is a potential issue it's not good at

108
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:15,200
individual level it's really only useful to look at a special temporal geographic type

109
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,640
caution okay when you say it's not good at an at an individual level meaning are you trying to

110
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:30,240
identify the individuals that may have the disease based on the the data that you're collecting

111
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:36,080
and what way if if you are doing that and what ways that not useful for the individuals it just

112
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:42,640
not accurate enough to a signal for that individual to go do take action yeah exactly so let's

113
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:47,600
say Sam you had an increased rest in heart rate which is the chief metric and it went out from

114
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:57,120
your normal just from 60 to 70 okay and your step decrease and your sleep increase those would

115
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,560
all be the three parameters that might forget you had 2019 but on an individual singlet on it

116
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,760
we you know you could have many others but if I found out that all your neighbors all your

117
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:17,040
networks were showing similar signs I'd say that's a signal so it's just not sharp enough I'd

118
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:23,120
add a one to you choosing you got a pretty coarse metrics to to look at for an individual

119
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:29,440
exactly or some of the are there you know technologies out there and some of these smartwatches

120
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,800
that you know can give you more granularity in terms of you know temperature I you know what would

121
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,360
you what would you wish you had access to to make it more useful for an individual well if we got

122
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,080
both body temperature accurately and oximetry the oxygen saturation of the body which now

123
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:55,200
the smartwatches have or are can activity we we could probably start getting more granular and

124
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,280
and get signals that would be useful potentially at an individual level but a lot of people never

125
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:09,200
have fever at least half or not more and oximetry the oxygen saturation you know that's not

126
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:16,960
going to drop down until the disease or the infection is further along but what's interesting

127
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:24,240
you bring up here is that because the asymptomatic carrier rate is high 30% or we think that

128
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:30,880
third people will have defines will have the higher heart rate because we know some of them have internal

129
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:37,280
hits or by ordinance at least the lungs so we think we'll be able to pick those up and that's

130
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,080
going to be important because otherwise these people would never know that they had an infection

131
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:49,680
yeah they were I think that the stats early on we're saying that or the stories early on we're

132
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:56,320
talking about folks we're losing I forget the specific percentage of lung capacity long term

133
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,480
even post disease and I think I always took that to be you know those folks that were you know

134
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,920
seriously affected and ended up on respiratory you know ventilators and the like

135
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,240
is what you're saying that you know even the asymptomatic folks will have that kind of

136
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:20,400
long-term effect do we know kind of the magnitude of potential long-term effects or the range of

137
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:26,320
long-term effects for the you know this huge population of asymptomatic folks yeah we don't know

138
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,960
unfortunately because we only had those four series they did the CAT scans of the lungs they

139
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,680
didn't repeat any CAT scans we do know that their lung abnormalities were similar to those who had

140
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,520
symptoms and we don't even have enough follow-up on the people with symptoms to know how soon

141
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:52,560
that that resolved most likely it resolves in most people but there may be some group we don't

142
00:15:52,560 --> 00:16:00,160
know how frequent where it becomes an enduring issue and there isn't complete resolution and that

143
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:09,040
may be partly mediated by the immune response that it just is not either sufficient or hyperactive

144
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,800
you know there's many different kind of responses here it's the way people handle this virus is

145
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:25,040
so heterogeneous yeah yeah in your book you talk quite a bit about deep phenotyping kind of this

146
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,720
really deep understanding of the individual on you know lots of different levels

147
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:40,080
you know how far have we gone with kind of trying to you know correlate some of that phenotyping data

148
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:46,320
to information about COVID to understand you know what might make someone the asymptomatic

149
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:54,080
having asymptomatic response versus what makes someone likely to you know have a more serious

150
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,520
response yeah that's a great question because is it just viral load or does some of that come from

151
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:05,200
the phenotype of the individual yeah it does come from the phenotype as well there's been now

152
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:13,280
several genomic studies getting back to my grounding when I the air add particularly

153
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:18,400
like to work in but there's been the so-called genome-wide association studies where you don't

154
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:24,000
consume anything you just let the genome talk and there's been two of those and they both

155
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,600
found that the blood type ABL blood type that the A type is got some intrigues risk perhaps 20 or

156
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:38,640
30 percent whereas all blood type has protective effects and there's also a locust on chromosome 3

157
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:46,080
which is many different immune receptor genes that lights up it's even that's even more prominent

158
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:54,240
so there are some genomic aspects of each of that that modulate our response there's immune

159
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,000
aspects that are tied to that but also in addition to that that are starting to show up we have

160
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,840
seen like for example there's a very rare syndrome in kids like Kawasaki's disease that is a tie to

161
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:15,200
the at least some of the kids have an immune system abnormality because 70 some of

162
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,200
some of these people of the kids that get this are actually very healthy they never had any preexisting

163
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:29,040
condition but there's something the glitch in their immune response whereas a hyper immune response

164
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,160
that a couple of weeks after an infection leads to their rare condition of multi-system and

165
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:42,160
inflammatory syndrome so-called MIS-C and this is a significant can be fatal in two to four

166
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,560
percent of children even though it's very rare so there's a continuum here and it is not just the

167
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:57,360
virus not just the setting but also the host the the individual you think about kind of where we've

168
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,640
come over the past six months and the the role that artificial intelligence could play

169
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:10,960
you know what are some of the things that you know you'd love to see or you know will expect

170
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,680
to see or think that um you know are missing in the way we've applied AI to to this particular

171
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:25,280
situation well we touched on one which is better detection before an outbreak really gets legs

172
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,520
and now I think we will be able to get to that it's already getting to be the case in Germany

173
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,000
and in China we're behind my we're behind everything here but hopefully we'll get there

174
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,120
another important application Sam is can people who are presenting to an emergency room

175
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:49,440
or telemedicine at their sick and then confirmed that they have an infection and should we

176
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,800
admit them to the hospital or let them stay home and I think we're going to see algorithms that

177
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:00,720
will help guide that because we want to keep people out of the hospital so they can stay in the

178
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:07,680
convenience their home with their family loved ones and also the expense of the hospital and hospitals

179
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,960
in some areas are already maximizing capacity so I think AI is going to help that we've got to get

180
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:20,240
validated algorithms to prove it yeah uh the other area that I think that's got lots of potential

181
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:27,680
is to support clinicians so that for example right now um there's some difficult choices like

182
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:38,400
should you use a blood pen should you put a patient on a ventilator and if we can get all the data

183
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:46,640
of not the individual but also as new data comes in from literature all a process we can help

184
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:53,520
clinicians to make better decisions more accurate interpretations of the overwhelming data that

185
00:20:53,520 --> 00:21:02,880
they're doing. One of the conversations in the book that I thought was most interesting was

186
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:09,600
and when you started to you were kind of bringing in this concept of system one and system two

187
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:16,480
thinking and how you were just talking about you know what happens when a patient presents in a

188
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:23,840
hospital uh how a lot of the success of medicine if you can put it like that is based on kind of

189
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,680
system one immediate responses and how a lot of medical training is honing that you know system one

190
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:40,320
response uh and you know there's a clear parallel between that system one thinking and uh what

191
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,560
machine learning is currently good at what deep learning is currently good at Andrew Wang says

192
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,480
you know machine learning is best for anything that a computer can do or that a human can do and

193
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:58,320
less than a second kind of these snap uh judgment and responses um yeah I was wondering if you

194
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,000
can elaborate a little bit on um you know this whole idea of system one and system two and the

195
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,680
interplay with AI yeah I know it's really important and fundamental actually I hear because

196
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:18,480
doctors make a lot of mistakes by reflexive thinking instead of reflective system two thing

197
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:25,760
uh Danny Connerman kind of nailed it in terms of that our brain makes reflex

198
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,560
judgments and decisions and in medicine that may not be good for person health

199
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:38,080
in fact it leads to a lot of diagnostic inaccuracy whereas if we had the machine support

200
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:45,280
then it would be more time to switch in to reflective system two thinking and get more

201
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:51,120
accurate so you have both a combined effect of the machine processing data for that person

202
00:22:52,160 --> 00:23:00,560
but also the gift of time to think which is not enough of in medicine today that's the ultimate

203
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:06,960
gift that AI can bring to medicine is the gift of time. There was some data points that you presented

204
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:15,200
that's if I interpreted them correctly seem to be suggesting that when doctors actually do think

205
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:23,040
they're uh the accuracy of their diagnoses decreases that seem to suggest that you know that when

206
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:28,720
they you know hone their kind of reflexive you know thinking and kind of make these immediate

207
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:36,000
judgments that they they tended to make better diagnoses am I interpreting that you know those

208
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,600
data points correctly and and how does you know how do we kind of integrate that with you know

209
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,880
giving doctors more time to to think about um you know what they're seeing. Well I think that's

210
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:54,320
a little off Sam I think that what the data showed for example if as a doctor I keep if I think

211
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:02,720
of the diagnosis in the first five minutes in working with a patient I think of it on a list

212
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,720
then the accuracy is pretty good but if it doesn't come to mind the accuracy dropped off from

213
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:15,520
you know whatever 90 plus percent to 20 some percent and so the point thing is humans are biased

214
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:22,480
and so are of course all conditions of caring for patients and we have 180 different types of

215
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:32,480
bias yep and so that bias it's in the way of that reflexive thinking and so when you have support from

216
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:39,920
validated algorithms that can you know handle this data and you can provide that oversight for

217
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:45,600
example in that example that example I just gave you might not have included in your mental

218
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,160
list the diagnosis the patient actually had is you just didn't come to mind but you got prompted

219
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,960
because the algorithm suggested that there's a probability of whatever 20 x percent

220
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,920
this dialogue should be considered and then now you're thinking about that it never was in your

221
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:12,560
mind so that's uh I think availability bias and I think that's this one example of many whereby

222
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:21,920
you seem support and a human oversight is the best combination. You're thinking about medicine

223
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:30,000
you know more broadly you know where what are you excited about seeing in terms of AI since you've

224
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,000
you know started researching this and wrote the book. Well there's kind of a short term and a

225
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:45,440
longer term expectation short term the accuracy of image interpretation should go way up I mean

226
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:53,760
it really has all the potential and we'll see it not just in radiology dermatology pathology all

227
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,360
aspects of medicine cardiology and what's interesting is that the mode for the randomized trials

228
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,840
have been a gastroenterology to pick up pilots randomized throughout six of them and ophthalmology

229
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:13,120
is leading the charge in terms of every potential serious eye condition to be better diagnosed with

230
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:20,480
support through deep neural networks so that's the short term and I'll add in that short term

231
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:28,720
getting rid of keyboard in the doctor's office then it depends on that is using the voice and

232
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,680
synthetic notes instead of having to lose that intimate eye contact it's vital for the human

233
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:42,320
connection and that's a segue to the longer term which is restoring the medical

234
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:49,680
intimate relationship with trust the human connection between patients and their doctors and

235
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:57,120
nurses and that's where I think we have this unparalleled opportunity if we work on it and the

236
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:06,640
premise there is that you know by you know shifting from a keyboard oriented interaction to

237
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,680
voice the doctor can be more present with the patient and establish that trust or do you see a

238
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:20,320
more direct role for AI in that establishing that trust relationship well you certainly brought

239
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:27,600
up one key way which is the ability to actually talk to patients be with them have a presence

240
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:35,520
but we also review the fact that it's impossible for any person now any doctor or nurse clinician

241
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:43,600
to review all that data and you know use instead of that time where it would detract from the patient

242
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:51,120
interaction that would be processed and crystallized for that condition but the other part that we

243
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:59,120
haven't brought up really is the patient economy so most of the common diagnoses like a skin

244
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,040
rash or a lesion an ear infection in the child a urinary tract infection heart rhythm

245
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:13,360
abnormalities both on and on AI tool will give patient a doctorless diagnostic capability they've

246
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,920
never had before we've already started seeing that so we can shift the interaction between

247
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:25,760
doctors and patients the more important matters like the treatment for that condition that

248
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:33,280
was diagnosed by them or things that are of important nature like a new diagnosis of cancer

249
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:39,360
neurodegenerative disease or heart disease something like that so the whole idea is that we can

250
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:48,320
use this foundation of analytic to restore the immunity in those machines keep getting smarter

251
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,960
hopefully humans can get more human. We first started seeing a lot of the successes around

252
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:08,080
machine assisted or machine identification of things in medical imagery a lot of the media

253
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:16,960
and conversations were around AI replacing radiologists and the like I think in I hope and you

254
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,920
know the community of this podcast where beyond that but do you feel like as a broader community

255
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:29,600
you know we're beyond that are we still you know struggling with this kind of either or

256
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:36,080
relationship between physicians and AI and technology in general really great question

257
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:43,280
the problem is that we're still in the mindset like when Gary Pesborough played big blue

258
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:50,560
and chess and we're still there almost all the papers that come out comparing the algorithmic

259
00:29:51,120 --> 00:30:00,320
versus the doctor rather than the deep neural network data versus the combination of that and

260
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:08,240
stuff so whether it's radiologic images or pathology specimens or whatever it is God Sam we don't

261
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,200
we're not in the mode generally there's been a few papers that looked at that but most of them are

262
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,840
painting machines versus man which is the wrong that's not wait it's going to go all night

263
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:28,000
in the future so we're still stuck in that mode of the classic I guess competition and it's

264
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,760
silly eventually we'll get beyond that but though there's very limited studies that have really

265
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:40,400
looked at the way it stimulates how medicine will ultimately be practiced when we're at full

266
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:46,320
machine support yeah there was one that comes to mind out of one of the medical centers in Boston

267
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:54,000
I believe they were looking at breast cancer imagery and this was you know three four years ago

268
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,600
I was one of the first ones that looked at doctor versus you know algorithm versus doctor plus

269
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:07,040
algorithm and it was you know their result was clear that the doctor you know and the algorithm

270
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:14,080
performed much better than either alone has you've said that you know there haven't been enough

271
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,880
studies there but has that have we seen any replication of that across different you know

272
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:25,120
types of images and diseases yes the problem is most of the studies that have been done now hundreds

273
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,800
of them are retrospective okay so what they're doing they're just going back and they have pristine

274
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:37,200
data set and then they're testing their and validating their algorithm and saying well look this

275
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,400
works as well or better often claiming superior performance the only way to really do it right

276
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:50,560
as you're getting to which is showing that the combination is better than machine long or the

277
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:58,000
doctoral is a prospective study and there are some of those perhaps you know more than 10 now

278
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,640
approaching 20 but those are much fewer and far between that they're just we need more of those

279
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,920
just like we need more randomized trials and it's all the way is it just a matter of time or is it

280
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:16,320
uh the cost and you know complexity or other factors associated with these prospective studies

281
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:23,680
well the convenience is that there's these large annotated data set what it's shifted for AIDS

282
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:29,040
or cardiograms or mammograms as you mentioned and they and skin regions they just get used

283
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:34,960
over and over again whereas to do it right you've got to have developed your own new large

284
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,760
annotated data sets and that is what the challenge is that you as you touch on its expense it takes time

285
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:48,240
it has been done uh but you know I think we need more of that uh that'll help with you

286
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:56,320
mm-hmm are there any particular studies that you are currently tracking that you know seem you

287
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:00,720
know interesting and promising well we're just about to start one where we think it's exciting

288
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:07,680
about diabetes okay believe it or not if you're a diabetic now the only algorithm you have to

289
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:16,400
support you is your glucose is going up or down if you have a glucose sensor which is pretty

290
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:24,080
incredible it's 2020 I think and that's the best we can do right so we're working on a multi-dimensional

291
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:31,520
prospective study and a thousand people with type 2 diabetes with a glucose sensor taking pictures

292
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:37,520
of everything they eat and drink getting their gut microbiome their genome their physical activity

293
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:42,640
their sleep their stress you know everything you can think of and developing an algorithm to help

294
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:51,360
them manage based on their data their glucose regulation and we know that certain foods have a

295
00:33:51,360 --> 00:34:00,000
completely disparate response and on an individual basis so we hope that we can do is provide each

296
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:08,480
person in the future as this ideally is validated and expanded much better than your glucose is

297
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,680
going up or down yeah I mean it's just it's just incredible and that's just kind of where the field

298
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:21,360
is right now we're we're at a primitive state where we have so much vast potential in front of us

299
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:29,200
yeah you your example kind of points out this idea of personalized medicine that has been I

300
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:38,320
think that probably grew out of the the work in genomics 10 20 years ago and I'm curious your

301
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,480
assessment of how close we've gotten to that or you know where we've we've had success with that

302
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,520
it certainly doesn't seem from my perspective as a layperson and a consumer of medicine that

303
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:55,440
when I'm going to the doctor my experience is particularly personalized based on you know genome

304
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,640
and and all these things in spite of the fact that a lot of the things that we said we would need

305
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:07,280
in order to get there the the cost and time of doing a whole sequence on an individual you know

306
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,320
we've achieved a lot of those milestones you know what you what and where are we and what's

307
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:19,200
lacking yeah well it's funny you mentioned that because last Friday during 26 with the 20th

308
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:26,320
anniversary of the human the genome sequence graph you know the White House the whole fanfare

309
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,920
and those 20 years has been remarkable progress but not in the things that you're getting at which

310
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:40,000
is rare doesn't is unknown to these is in cancer that is the sequence helping to guide therapies

311
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,800
many patients in people in women who are pregnant to help guide whether they made the harboring

312
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,240
serious chromosomal abnormalities in the fetus without having to go through amniocentesis

313
00:35:52,240 --> 00:36:01,280
there's been select major transformative progress but it hasn't been made and as you said the

314
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:08,000
sequence can be done for thousand dollars which is still expensive but compared to a lot of other

315
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,800
tests we do in medicine like cat scans in MRI it's not that crazy but it isn't accepted by the

316
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,000
medical community yet there's still lots of resistance and unfortunately that is holding us back

317
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,960
and also we don't interpret the genome adequately because we need hundreds of millions if not

318
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,840
billions to be able to get the most extract the most information from a genome for that person

319
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:40,880
so we're still on that kind of early stage we're only limited health systems have started to

320
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,120
implement it like geising or in Pennsylvania but most places are not using dynamics on a

321
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,880
wide scale basis yet they're holding back part of it's been the cost and the reimbursement

322
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,720
of lack of education of clinicians and a bunch of other factors but eventually I think we'll get

323
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:05,200
there but I have to agree with you that a 20 years post genome sequence in some respects it's

324
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,840
been disappointing when you say millions or billions you know we'll need millions or billions

325
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:18,800
what are you referring to samples or something else yes if we had millions of people

326
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:27,200
sent to people sequence and then with their phenotype that would follow because your phenotype

327
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,760
today may change you may have a heart attack or you may have a new diagnosis of whatever

328
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:40,640
so if we want to have all that data things like your response to medication and all sorts of things

329
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,960
if we had a common data set with that large number of genome with the accompanying

330
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,640
technical information then it becomes more valuable then it gets to mind a dream state or fantasy

331
00:37:52,640 --> 00:38:01,760
thing of the planetary health system where you have a digital twin infrastructure so let's say you

332
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:10,400
got sick Sam and I can take your data put it into the resource find it six twin of your that

333
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,600
match on every possible way which way and nearest neighbor analysis and then I get

334
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:21,440
saying hmm this is your best treatment is your best outcomes or I can say here's how we prevent

335
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:27,280
the condition but we are a long ways from that we can't even get the resource really built

336
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,680
uh no less all the countries to work together to develop this planetary learning health system

337
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:40,080
but theoretically possible and we are seeing it starting in areas in specific areas like cancer

338
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:46,400
hopefully we'll see it much more in general in the future yeah that brings some on you know as

339
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,400
did our conversation about contact tracing earlier on you know issues around privacy and others

340
00:38:52,400 --> 00:39:02,240
that you need to be accounted for in you know realizing visions like like yours anything interesting

341
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:09,040
happening in that space yeah it's funny you have to love that too um kypholini and I

342
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,960
published a paper on this nature biotent it takes the planet and basically we wouldn't

343
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,440
believe in and talk about this this planetary health system or this you know massive information

344
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:27,840
ignored without iterating AI so the data never left the place and basically you know the algorithm

345
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:35,760
can't do the data to preserve the privacy and security and homomorphic encryption so the new tools

346
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:43,040
are now available that weren't necessarily refined to more recently that are going to help

347
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:52,000
achieve this ideal of privacy protecting privacy uh and uh having the data in such a state that

348
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:58,560
the chances of having like we have today uh breaches and hacks and all sorts of

349
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:05,680
of course nature of uh important precious data that we can avoid that so that's the whole that

350
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,280
will employ these new methods that are actually pretty exciting because without them these idea

351
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,680
would be ill-conceived great great all right thanks so much for taking the time to chat with us

352
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:25,440
and share a bit about your perspective on uh the field and the pandemic any parting thoughts

353
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,800
or words for our audience no i really enjoyed the conversations and we've had so many great

354
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:38,400
questions and hopefully that listeners will get some ideas about where the field can go

355
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:45,440
because it really is exciting uh and it could be the most important impact on medicine going

356
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,280
forward the likes of which we've not ever seen before it may not be seen for generations

357
00:40:51,280 --> 00:41:01,600
today absolutely thank you thank you all right everyone that's our show for today for more
