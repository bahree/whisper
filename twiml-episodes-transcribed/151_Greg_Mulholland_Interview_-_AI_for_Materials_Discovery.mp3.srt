00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:31,360
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:37,920
In this episode I'm joined by Greg Mulholland, founder and CEO of Citrine Informatics, which

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,960
is applying AI to the discovery and development of new materials.

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,880
Greg and I start out with an exploration of some of the challenges of the status quo in

7
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:52,680
material science and what's to be gained by introducing machine learning into this process.

8
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,840
We discuss how limitations and materials manifest themselves and Greg shares a few examples

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,800
from the company's work optimizing battery components and solar cells.

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,560
We dig into the role and sources of data used in applying machine learning and materials

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,200
and some of the unique challenges to collecting it, as well as discuss the pipeline and algorithms

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,120
Citrine uses to deliver it service.

13
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,360
This was a fun conversation that spends physics, chemistry and of course machine learning,

14
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,920
and I hope you enjoy it.

15
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,960
All right, let's do it.

16
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,160
All right everyone, I am on the line with Greg Mulholland.

17
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,840
Greg is founder and CEO of a company called Citrine Informatics.

18
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,080
Greg and Citrine are focused on the application of AI to materials and chemistry and I'm really

19
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,600
looking forward to digging into that in this show.

20
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,000
Greg, welcome to this weekend machine learning and AI.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,280
Thanks Sam, really glad to be here.

22
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:51,360
So tell us a little bit about your background, how do you get started working in this intersection

23
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,800
of materials and machine learning and AI?

24
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,880
Well, when I started my college career, I was really focused actually, I was focused

25
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,280
on electrical engineering.

26
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,000
So I was a computer engineer, I was doing processor design, but I actually became fascinated

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,120
by the fact that everything I kept running into in the electronics world and frankly everything

28
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,240
I kept running into among my mechanical engineering friends and product design friends was that

29
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:23,040
the materials that they had available to them were really the limiting factor in a lot

30
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,920
of the products that they that they loved.

31
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,680
And so I actually, because I had this programming background, because I had this computer engineering

32
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:36,080
background, I started thinking a lot about how can we use these machine learning techniques

33
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,000
and use these advanced analytics techniques to accelerate this really important field.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,760
And I actually ended up going into the materials fields purely, I worked in a small semi conductor

35
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,360
company where we made materials for LEDs and power electronics.

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,680
And I saw exactly what I expected to, which was that we were really good at generating

37
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:01,280
huge volumes of data and frankly, pretty poor at using them effectively to make better

38
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,280
decisions.

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,440
And so when I met my, the person who became my co-founder, Bryce, he had a background

40
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,640
in machine learning for materials and we kind of had this magical overlap of his expertise

41
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,640
in analyzing data, my expertise in generating it.

42
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,600
And it turns out there's a lot of cool things you can do in the materials industry by combining

43
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,080
those two things.

44
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,120
You mentioned running into some limitations of materials early in your career.

45
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:37,640
What are some of those limitations and what are some of the ways that issues around materials

46
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,720
manifest both for us as consumers and for businesses?

47
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:46,600
Yeah, so for me, the first place I started was transistors.

48
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:53,880
I started looking at what is limiting our processor speed, what is limiting our ability to kind

49
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,840
of have these more advanced processors and technologies around us.

50
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,360
But as I looked into it more and more, I realized the fuel efficiency of every vehicle, the

51
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,960
fuel efficiency of a plane, the batteries that power our electronics, the medical devices

52
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:15,560
that we put inside our bodies, they're all limited by our ability to make them out of

53
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,880
things that do the job better than anything else.

54
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,880
And so for me, I look around the world and see a world filled with materials being used

55
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,600
for things in the shape of products, not a world of products that stand on their own.

56
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,280
Those really are the enabling technology of most things that we love today.

57
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,240
So maybe give us some examples of materials that you've had an opportunity to work with

58
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,920
and with Citrine.

59
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,600
Yeah, so we actually started in a bunch of different energy materials.

60
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,640
And so one of my passions has always been energy.

61
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:59,400
And using things, when you take something like a battery, for example, a battery is simply

62
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,360
several layers of material stacked in an appropriate way to create a highly engineered structure

63
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,360
of store energy.

64
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,520
And so one thing that Citrine has worked on quite a lot actually is figuring out how

65
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,000
to optimize the anode, the cathode, the electrolyte, and other internal components of batteries

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,080
to make them last longer to have higher voltage to be safer.

67
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,240
And that's been a real area for us where we've had some pretty exciting results because

68
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,280
the reality is none of us are happy with how our batteries perform.

69
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,520
And so being able to push those forward is an exciting thing to be able to do.

70
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:42,640
But we also have had an opportunity to discover new lightweight aerospace alloys.

71
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:50,000
So 3D print alloys that make a plane lighter or a gen engine perform more efficiently.

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,320
Because at the end of the day, the efficiency of these aircraft and the cost of running

73
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,320
them and the pollution they put out is limited very much by the weight and the performance

74
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,480
of the materials in them.

75
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,320
So we really worked very, very broadly.

76
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:13,800
And we've seen the power of AI across everything from new polymers and plastics, to new glasses,

77
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:20,000
to new textile materials, to new paints and coatings all the way to batteries and processors.

78
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,400
So it's really a very broad industry with huge impact.

79
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,720
I remember reading not too long ago, maybe six months ago or so, some articles about

80
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:39,520
some work that I think was Autodesk was doing in printing, 3D printing, it was like basically

81
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,760
the walls that separate the different cabins in an aircraft.

82
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,240
I forget the word for it.

83
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,240
Oh, the bulkhead.

84
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,240
The bulkhead.

85
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,640
Yeah, exactly.

86
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
You mentioned 3D printing.

87
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,080
Now, are you talking about the actual material that is used and the 3D printing is what

88
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,760
you worked on or something like they did with the generative design?

89
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
Yeah.

90
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,240
So I'm talking about the actual materials.

91
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:07,960
Because in the 3D printing world, the tradition has been and this makes perfect sense that you

92
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,880
have this list of aluminum alloys or steels or various metals or plastics that you have

93
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:19,240
used in a non-3D printing way, we have made things without using 3D printing for a long

94
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,240
time.

95
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,240
And the idea is, hey, why don't we just make a powder out of them, put them in a 3D printer,

96
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,280
and then we 3D print the part out of that material.

97
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,080
And it turns out that the way a 3D printer works is actually pretty different from a normal

98
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,320
manufacturing technique.

99
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,560
And so when you put those materials in, you get something very different out than you

100
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,960
would using a traditional manufacturing technique.

101
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,840
So we actually work with companies to help identify how do we modify these materials to actually

102
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,640
create a more performant, better material that's optimized for 3D printing rather than

103
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,560
just trying to take what we've used for 50 or 100 years and repurpose it into this totally

104
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,280
new manufacturing mode.

105
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:06,160
So you're applying AI machine learning to these types of problems?

106
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,840
So materials presents a pretty unique set of challenges for an AI system.

107
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:20,000
And the reason for that is the demands on materials are different than most other sort

108
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,920
of machine learning applications.

109
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:29,640
For example, if you take aluminum alloys, which is a very, almost every plane has a huge

110
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:34,120
number of different aluminum alloys in it because it's nice and light and it's very strong,

111
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,240
there's a big problem because when you talk most of the folks on your show have access

112
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,640
to many millions or tens of millions or even billions of data points about the things

113
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,920
they're trying to target.

114
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,840
When we talk about aluminum alloys, we're talking about maybe 5 to 10,000 data points

115
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,200
that have ever been rigorously measured.

116
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,280
And if you're talking about what any one person has, it can be just a few hundred or a few

117
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
thousand.

118
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,160
And so we're not in this world in materials and chemistry where we can sort of blindly

119
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,520
throw deep learning at a huge data set and then refine it over time and get some really

120
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,360
interesting good results.

121
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,320
In materials and chemistry, we suffer from a small data problem.

122
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,400
And by the way, every additional data point can cost millions of dollars.

123
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,640
And so it's not even cheap to generate new data.

124
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,680
It's actually a really big challenge.

125
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,760
And so as we develop AI systems that are tailored at the materials industry, we actually

126
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,760
have to focus on how do we use the limited data that we have available to us today to

127
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,920
solve a really hard problem.

128
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,680
And then the other piece, and there are a lot of differences.

129
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,520
Actually, before you move on from there, can you elaborate on when you say data point

130
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,760
in this context, what you're specifically referring to?

131
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
Sure.

132
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:57,520
And when I talk about a data point, there are some canonical measurements that people

133
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,680
do on materials.

134
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,920
So take, for example, an aluminum alloy, you would test the strength of that material,

135
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,280
how easy is it to break, how easy is it to scratch?

136
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,120
And you get single numbers out or curves out of those tests.

137
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,880
And there are typically a six to ten of them in any area that are kind of the critical

138
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,120
questions we ask before we use a material, how well does it fatigue, does it corrode?

139
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:29,000
Is it a material that will break if you smash something against it?

140
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,280
These are both for safety reasons and performance reasons, the critical questions we ask.

141
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,320
But in metals in particular, but in a lot of areas of high performance materials, you

142
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,960
can do a test to know how something ages that lasts for 10 or 100,000 hours.

143
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,480
And that is, understandably, a very expensive test to do.

144
00:10:49,480 --> 00:11:00,320
To what extent do the data points associated with or that can be aggregated from the manufacturing

145
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,800
process plan of this?

146
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:08,640
So I don't know how long it takes to manufacture a given piece of aluminum, but assuming

147
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,800
that there are some number of steps and there are a whole variety of process parameters

148
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:21,960
and temperatures and humidities and things like this that go into determining how strong

149
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:29,920
and light the material will ultimately be, are those also part of what you consider to

150
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,320
be the data set or are you only looking at the properties of the final product?

151
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:40,640
So that is absolutely part of the data set, but in a very interesting way.

152
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,800
The way most materials companies work today is they have a factory or a plant that produces

153
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,360
a handful of different materials in incredibly high volumes.

154
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,680
And so if you're in Alcoa or you're a Corning or you're a 3M, when you have manufacturing

155
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:02,320
data, that manufacturing data is just terabytes and terabytes of data, petabytes of data over

156
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:09,640
days and weeks, about one material, it's just a tremendous amount of depth on one material.

157
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,880
So the big change that's come to the materials industry that's really interesting is that,

158
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:19,000
well, for some materials that's really important, the demands on these materials companies

159
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,920
is to come up with new materials faster.

160
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,480
And the example I always love to use is guerrilla glass.

161
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,960
So I think a lot of people are familiar with the Steve Jobs story about how that came

162
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:38,360
to be the front of the iPhone, but what people don't think about is that Apple wants

163
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,440
a new glass for their phone every year.

164
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,000
They're an incredibly demanding company and they are a company that wants to have the

165
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,400
highest performing product on the market.

166
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:52,080
And most materials companies take three to five years or more to develop a new product.

167
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,880
And so Apple is now saying to Corning, hey, I want a new glass every single year.

168
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,960
And Corning has to figure out a way to do that or else somebody else is going to come

169
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,400
in and provide that to Apple.

170
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,520
And so I think the big change that's come is that companies are very good at producing

171
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,240
what they produce very efficiently and where that used to be enough.

172
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,720
Now there's a real push to be able to innovate faster and to come up with that next generation

173
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:24,160
battery or next generation vehicle or next generation phone so much faster that really the

174
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,440
manufacturing information is helpful.

175
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,520
But you really need a diversity of data around many different materials to help optimize

176
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,680
for a particular use case.

177
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,040
Is the implication of what you're saying that you're the kinds of customers you're targeting

178
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:46,000
are not necessarily these, it's not kind of the production, the ongoing production of

179
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:53,600
existing material as much as this R&D process to get to newer types of materials.

180
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,600
That's exactly right.

181
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:00,840
So we're really focused on enabling these, the world's finest materials companies to move

182
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,440
much, much faster in the development and deployment of new materials.

183
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,880
And then of course we assist in the scale process and we assist in manufacturing optimization

184
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,960
and those sorts of things.

185
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,480
But where we're really differentiated is that ability to to take these relatively small

186
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,840
diverse development data sets and help companies come up with those new high performance signature

187
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
materials.

188
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,680
In some cases 50 to 70% faster than they would have been able to otherwise.

189
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:32,960
All right, and so given the way you've described this as kind of a small data problem, what

190
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,800
does the approach look like?

191
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,600
So the beautiful thing about materials is that we have a trick up our sleeve that most

192
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,640
other industries don't and that's that we have the laws of physics and chemistry in our

193
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,640
pocket.

194
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:51,840
You know, as scientists, we learned about how materials behave without ever seeing data.

195
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,000
And then at the end of our careers, as we got graduate degrees or went into industry,

196
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,600
we saw the data around materials help us refine what we believed about those materials

197
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,600
performance.

198
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,400
And we use machine learning in exactly the same way.

199
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:11,560
When we have a physical understanding of how atoms bond, for example, or how two elements

200
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,920
in a particular material interact, we use those formulae.

201
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,960
We use those relationships built into a machine learning system, built into a larger infrastructure.

202
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,960
But it turns out there are a lot of materials, mysteries in materials still.

203
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,800
There are a lot of areas of materials where we don't exactly know the fundamental phenomena

204
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,880
that are dominating.

205
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,160
And so what we say is for those, we have data.

206
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,360
We were able to use the small amount of data we have to connect the theory we understand

207
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,560
with the things we don't and more accurately fill in the gaps.

208
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:50,120
And then the beautiful part about it is the companies we work with are highly experimentally

209
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
oriented.

210
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,360
So they're constantly generating new data.

211
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,560
And so just like a human, you know, a machine learning system can come in and actually learn

212
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,680
alongside and be the perfect lab assistant.

213
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,960
It never forgets anything.

214
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,840
It's relatively unbiased.

215
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,920
It is able to surface new ideas and it's able to help humans come up with better hypotheses

216
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,520
which lead to better results faster.

217
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:17,640
Can you maybe help us make this a little bit more concrete by talking about in the context

218
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:23,680
of one of these examples that you've given, you know, what the process might look like,

219
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,120
what the pipeline might look like, what some of the systems and algorithms look like that

220
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,880
help you get to, you know, developing new materials more quickly?

221
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,200
Sure, absolutely.

222
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,680
There are, like I said, there are many, many places we've worked, but one in particular

223
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,880
that I always like to think about is with a solar cell company.

224
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,520
And so we worked on a specific class of solar cell and basically the goal was they wanted

225
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,640
to absorb light at a certain wavelength.

226
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,880
You know, they want to make sure they're absorbing light that's coming in from the sun.

227
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,360
They wanted to do it highly efficiently and they wanted it to have the specific stability

228
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
requirements.

229
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,840
You obviously don't want your solar cell to degrade over time.

230
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:11,200
And so what we did is we said, look, you have a lot of fundamental data about the solar

231
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,920
absorbance of a material.

232
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,280
So it's, you know, there's sort of all these electronic calculations that people have

233
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,280
done for years and years.

234
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,200
And actually, a Nobel Prize was awarded for coming up with these relationships.

235
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,560
And so we said, well, you have that knowledge to begin with.

236
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,280
So let's not reinvent that.

237
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,000
We don't need to learn the relationships that want to Nobel Prize from, you know, several

238
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,160
hundred data points.

239
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,200
We just can put that into the system.

240
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,960
And then what we do is we say the goal of what you have of your final product is the

241
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,760
solar cell with these six or eight or 10 particular properties.

242
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,880
In this case, it was about 10.

243
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,200
And what we did is we said the data that we have can help us bridge from the fundamental

244
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,480
relationship that we have.

245
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,160
So we'll put those equations in.

246
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,280
We're going to use that alongside data in a framework that I'm happy to describe in

247
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,280
a moment.

248
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,480
And then we're going to generate a set of hypotheses for what new materials might achieve

249
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,880
the goals you've set out to achieve.

250
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,600
And this is the real key because what we don't want to do and what AI is not likely to

251
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,520
do any time soon is to say, aha, here's your one right answer.

252
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,520
Go make it.

253
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,040
What AI is very good at doing in materials and chemistry is to say, here are some highly

254
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,760
probable candidates.

255
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,760
You should go try those.

256
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,160
A human will select a few to try them.

257
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,480
And then as new data is generated, that gets folded back into the algorithm and it's allowed

258
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,880
to obviously relearn and retrain and then make a set of new suggestions.

259
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,480
And that's very in line with the scientific method.

260
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:51,760
You hypothesize, you test, you conclude something and you come back with a new better hypothesis.

261
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:56,480
And the AI system simply helps you do that much more efficiently.

262
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:02,480
One of the themes that surfaces on the podcast pretty frequently is this idea that you're

263
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,200
poking out a little bit, some of the approaches like deep learning take the approach that you

264
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,560
just alluded to, take a whole bunch of data independent of any laws of physics or chemistry

265
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:19,160
and throw it at this deep learning model and let it try to figure everything out.

266
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,600
Whereas you've incorporated those laws of physics and chemistry, can you talk a little bit

267
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:32,360
about how you have made those to coexist in a machine learning framework?

268
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,680
Yeah, absolutely.

269
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:38,800
So we have a couple things that we truly believe in as sort of a philosophical basis here.

270
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:44,280
And I honestly think we've seen a lot more of this emerge in the AI community over

271
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,400
the last year or two because I think we as a community realize how important they are.

272
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,600
The first is we believe in interpretability.

273
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,840
I think one of the big challenges in deep learning actually is that you can throw a lot of

274
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,840
data at things.

275
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,320
You can sort of see what some of the neurons are doing, but a lot of times there's a big

276
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:06,600
black box component to what's going on because we sort of manually insert these relationships

277
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,520
in or automatically insert them, but in certain known relationships into these systems, understanding

278
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,000
how they construct themselves is really important.

279
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,880
The second thing that we really believe in which drives the answer to your question is uncertainty.

280
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,880
So one of the big problems in AI for scientific applications is that when you talk about things

281
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:32,640
like recommendation engines, if Netflix tells you you're going to like something with four

282
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,840
stars and you end up hating it, your plane doesn't fall out of the sky.

283
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,720
It's okay if Netflix is to be wrong every once in a while and it can sort of narrow itself

284
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,880
in on your preferences over time.

285
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,400
For us, we work with scientists who believe that there's a, who understand uncertainty

286
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,800
and who understand when a model is confident or not.

287
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:58,160
And so what we actually do is we build these very large graph networks where rather than

288
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:04,040
having a black box situation like deep learning, we're building a graph that's not so different

289
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:10,360
from a deep net, but has a, has nodes that we can control in it.

290
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,560
Some of those nodes are new data.

291
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:18,160
Some of those nodes are machine learning systems, whether they're deep learning, we'll use

292
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,760
deep learning for things like images or, or more sort of standard machine learning systems,

293
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,400
you know, forests or, or neural nets or what have you, we can really put anything into

294
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,800
these networks.

295
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:34,880
And then we can also conveniently put in, you know, arginious equations or a reaction

296
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,280
equation, reaction rates.

297
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,800
I mean, in some ways we sort of program high school chemistry and college chemistry into

298
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:47,000
the base levels of these nodes so that when the system is constructing these networks

299
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,480
and is testing nodes and is sort of moving through the possible models it can build, it's

300
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:57,320
able to access things that are not just, you know, the, the billion images of cats and

301
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,880
not cats that we have labeled, it's, it's actually looking at what is the, what is the underlying

302
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,000
chemistry and how does that connect between data and chemistry to minimize the uncertainty

303
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
of the model.

304
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,080
So we actually use uncertainties as a first class member of our system.

305
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,280
And that really helps us drive kind of model quality, hypothesis generation in this larger

306
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,760
framework of kind of graphically connected machine learning models.

307
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:27,600
Is there a simple example or way to explain the way the system uses and navigates these

308
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:35,080
nodes that, you know, can help us really generate some intuition for how it works?

309
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,080
Yeah, absolutely.

310
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,760
So, so, you know, I'll take a battery as an example.

311
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:47,480
So a battery is basically three layers of material, an anode, a cathode and an, and an electrolyte.

312
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,800
And those three materials are stacked cathode, electrolyte, anode, and the, the charge

313
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:58,320
moves between the two ends and that's how you, how you have a battery work.

314
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,080
The three materials you choose are critical because, you know, if they're not compatible

315
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,960
with each other or if they don't take advantage of each other's strengths, you're not going

316
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,200
to have a perform, perform in battery.

317
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:13,160
And so, that at a very high level is, is very simple, but if you, if you think as a material

318
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,920
scientist what about this problem, you actually realize there's a stacked set of, of problems

319
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,920
that all build up together.

320
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:26,080
And what I mean by that is each of those materials is composed of atoms.

321
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,280
And so when you talk about lithium ion, obviously lithium is the, is the primary ion that's

322
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,560
moving around in, in that battery.

323
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,400
Now the atom you choose is important.

324
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,360
There are sodium batteries, there are aluminum batteries, there are batteries based on

325
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:43,520
many elements and we have, and so, so the atoms matter, but atoms aren't all that matter.

326
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,800
So actually how the atom is bond together matters a lot.

327
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,680
And so that's sort of the next layer up is how these things interconnect with one another.

328
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,160
And then you can start thinking about, well, if they bond together one to one, what happens

329
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:00,160
when you zoom out a little further and say what happens over, you know, a micrometer or

330
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:04,800
what happens over a centimeter, you know, obviously you don't have perfect bonding, nothing

331
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,800
is perfect.

332
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,040
So you have things that are happening over much larger length scales.

333
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,040
And then you finally talk about what happens when you layer these three materials together

334
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:15,600
and how do you optimize them all at once.

335
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:22,960
And so what we do is we say we have good understanding about what a lithium atom is.

336
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,120
We have a very good understanding about how a lithium ion bonds to an oxygen ion.

337
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,720
We have a very good understanding of how things happen over large distances.

338
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,640
But what we don't have a good understanding of as a materials community is how to explicitly

339
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,360
connect all of that knowledge at the different length scales in such a way that allows us

340
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,560
to draw really accurate conclusions and builds really accurate models of how these materials

341
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,720
will behave.

342
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,600
And so what that means is we're really good at understanding one little piece of the

343
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,920
problem, but it's very hard to zoom out and see the whole forest and understand what

344
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,040
the whole structure is.

345
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,960
And so we actually use, when I say we build these graphical models, the graphical models

346
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:11,040
are actually combinations of data and these underlying sort of single length scale models

347
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:17,120
to allow us to connect the data and ML allows us to connect to the different length scales

348
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,120
and actually create better models that incorporate everything from high school chemistry.

349
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:28,800
How many electrons does this particular element have all the way up to what happens

350
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:33,000
if I leave it in the oven for an extra hour, all the way up to what happens when I seal

351
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,480
it in there with two other materials and how well does the battery perform over time?

352
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,960
In the case of an example like that, what would be you've got some of these nodes in this

353
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:49,160
graph represent data points about the materials and the atoms and the things that you've described.

354
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,760
And then some others represent machine learning models.

355
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:57,320
What would those be and what's the relationship that they play in this graph?

356
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:03,480
Yeah, so the machine learning models are what will say things like, well, we understand

357
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,200
how the lithium atoms all behave one to one.

358
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,240
And we understand how bonding happens at a very large scale, but we don't understand

359
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,280
how swapping 10% of the lithium out for silicon might actually affect the overall performance

360
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,280
of the battery.

361
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,080
We can't know how that propagates through the system.

362
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:31,080
And so that's where we use data and machine learning to identify trends across these

363
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:39,080
data sets that contain diverse materials data that allows us to zero in on some specific

364
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,960
higher performance.

365
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,280
And the other thing that it allows us to do is to actually answer a question that most

366
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,400
AI is actually quite bad at answering.

367
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,120
And in most AI systems, the goal is to identify things that are pretty similar to other things,

368
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,480
facial recognition.

369
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,000
It's looking for faces that are similar to faces it's seen before.

370
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,960
For us, R.A.I. systems are actually trying to reorient things and look for new materials

371
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,480
outside of the current space.

372
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,360
And so it might be that we're looking at lithium and silicon together and then all of

373
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,760
a sudden, somebody has a great idea that putting some carbon in there could be a real help.

374
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,320
Well, if no one's ever used carbon before, you have to have a really crafty way of being

375
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,840
able to represent what that looks like so that the machine learning system can lock

376
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,600
onto any signal at all.

377
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,760
And so the representations among these hierarchical units allows us to say to insert changes

378
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,320
like that and actually begin to push the envelope of what's possible rather than just saying,

379
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,120
oh yes, this is 50% between two things I've seen.

380
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:47,000
I'm just going to take a sort of do a logistic regression between the two and take the midpoint

381
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,880
and have that be the result of my prediction.

382
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:58,480
So is it fair to say that the nodes in this graph ultimately represent some kind of material

383
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:05,000
or chemical characteristics, some of which you have direct data about and so you can

384
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:12,320
insert those data points directly and others you're using machine learning to infer based

385
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,800
on some other data that you have.

386
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:22,000
So it's kind of like a hierarchical graph of these characteristics, is that fair?

387
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,520
That's precisely correct.

388
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,520
Okay.

389
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:31,160
And so ultimately then you are applying addition on another level of machine learning

390
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:39,560
on top of this graph to try to infer or learn about the relationships between these

391
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:47,120
different characteristics and then predict where you might find new materials that produce

392
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,880
some desired result.

393
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
That's exactly right.

394
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:56,120
So you can imagine in the guerrilla glass example because we all know what the demands

395
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
are on that, right?

396
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,520
We don't want it to break, we don't want it to scratch, we want it to be nice and transparent

397
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,680
and pretty light and that's more or less the properties that you're looking for.

398
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:12,760
And so what we would say is let's put those targets into the system and then use an optimization

399
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,200
system, whether AI based or not and it kind of depends on the use case, whether that

400
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:24,160
makes sense, to actually optimize the materials, the processing, the input elements, sort of

401
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:30,960
everything about that glass to achieve the thinnest, lightest, strongest, most scratch-resistant

402
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,520
guerrilla glass possible and we do that hand in hand with a scientist because it turns

403
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,720
out that scientific expertise is absolutely critical.

404
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,240
And so as that optimization step, are you, is the system spinning out other materials

405
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:55,040
or compounds or is it rather saying, you know, you're looking for something that has,

406
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:00,440
you know, this degree of distance to this other material or, you know, is it relative

407
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,840
or is it giving you absolute things to investigate?

408
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,080
Oh, it actually gives you absolute things to investigate.

409
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,760
So in the case of a glass, we would give you a specific chemical formula and we would

410
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,280
potentially give you even processing steps that we believe to be the things that will

411
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,760
achieve the goal you're trying to achieve.

412
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,760
And we return those, I mean, this is all part of the software system, right?

413
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:26,600
This isn't human driven.

414
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,520
But the scientist on the other end, the person who's developing that next generation

415
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:34,800
material will look at that list and say, well, you know, it turns out you've suggested

416
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,360
a glass that has lead in it.

417
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,680
Well, that might be a great glass.

418
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,920
I don't really want to make it.

419
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,640
So we're going to avoid that one.

420
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,280
And we are going to move on and say, actually, these other three are very interesting.

421
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:49,760
So the scientists will then exert their intuition to say, I'm going to go make those now.

422
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,440
And when I make them, I will return the data into the system, which obviously helps us

423
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:57,840
map the data space better and helps us provide even better recommendations.

424
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:03,880
So it's a sequential learning system that allows us to work hand in hand with the scientists

425
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,320
to develop those next generation products.

426
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:12,920
What is that process for working with scientists look like from a kind of timeline perspective?

427
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:16,040
You know, it really varies based on the domain.

428
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,920
There are materials in chemistry is just an incredibly diverse industry.

429
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,720
I think it's easy from the outside to say, well, you know, it's kind of one, one model

430
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
of the industry.

431
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,680
Especially more than a dozen subgroups.

432
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:37,200
In most cases though, we first work with a scientist to identify the data that underpins

433
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,920
what they believe to be the most important signals and trends in their industry.

434
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:47,000
These scientists, in some cases, spent decades working in a specific area and know their

435
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
industry incredibly well or know their area incredibly well.

436
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,240
And so we always start there.

437
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,600
And then what we do is we say, you know, look, we can build these, we just called them

438
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
first pass models.

439
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,600
We kind of help them construct these, the first version of the graph.

440
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,800
And then we allow them to begin to edit the graph.

441
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,440
We allow them to insert nodes.

442
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:16,440
We allow them to create latent variables, add additional data and really strike up a scientific

443
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,320
conversation with the system that refines over time.

444
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:25,600
The first little bit of somebody using our system is not directly going to experiment.

445
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,400
It's learning how to operate this powerful new tool.

446
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,840
And then over time, they begin to add data.

447
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,600
They begin to gain confidence in why the system is recommending what it's recommending.

448
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,200
And once they have that confidence, it's very easy for us to say, hey, you know, why

449
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,880
don't you go try to make this, make this material, give it a try.

450
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,520
And I'll tell you what, it almost never works perfectly the first time.

451
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,720
There's, you know, the model is never right on target the first time.

452
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:57,800
But what it does is it creates this back and forth conversation between the AI system

453
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:03,160
and the expert scientists to be able to say, you as an expert scientist are not perfect

454
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
every time.

455
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,920
Humans are deeply flawed in many ways with respect to data.

456
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:14,160
And an AI system is, frankly, deeply flawed, no matter how hard you try in a completely

457
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,800
understanding what humans have learned about chemistry.

458
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,280
But as a team, there's a really powerful back and forth effect where the AI system can

459
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,320
learn and have additional information injected into it.

460
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:30,400
And the human can release some of that data analysis burden and start to think creatively

461
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,480
about how to solve these really difficult problems.

462
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:39,160
Have you run into any use cases that the system just isn't able to handle yet?

463
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,560
And if so, what are, you know, what are the sources of those limitations?

464
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:50,080
You know, we haven't run into anything that is a complete and abject failure.

465
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:56,120
I think one of the reasons for that is that there's a, that there's a sort of assumption

466
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,160
that it is an iterative process.

467
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:03,880
And so that's a, you know, if you sort of understand it to always be a hill climb in

468
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:10,440
some ways, you know, you kind of don't, taking failure is, you know, saying it failed

469
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,320
completely is sort of impossible.

470
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,440
Because I will say, you know, one of the things that, that we found to be very interesting

471
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:24,400
is that there are some areas of materials where there is so little knowledge or there is

472
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:31,360
such a breadth of, of theory about why something happens that it can actually be really challenging

473
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:36,760
to, to use an AI system to do, to have a great effect.

474
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,080
And an example there I'd use is superconductors.

475
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:45,280
So this is a type of material that when you cool it down to below liquid nitrogen temperature

476
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,920
or even colder, they are wires that have no resistance.

477
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,800
So you know, you could use them to very efficiently transmit electricity, for example, and this

478
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,960
is something they're used for.

479
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,000
But there are a few different classes of superconductors.

480
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,720
Pretty much any time a new superconductor is discovered, a Nobel Prize is awarded.

481
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,200
Which the theory that underpins it, there are some very strong theories, but the way that

482
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:17,000
we capture data and the way that we understand these things to work is wholly incomplete.

483
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,360
And so I think there are certainly areas of materials where, you know, we just don't

484
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:28,480
have the, the grounding to, to build an AI system that is going to really kind of break

485
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,560
into that new space because the data landscape isn't dense enough and, and the, the underlying

486
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,400
theory that we would normally inject is frankly not so well understood that we can do that

487
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,120
with great confidence.

488
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:46,000
And so I would actually say that that's one of the, one of the biggest challenge areas

489
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,440
and there are a few, a few areas like that where, you know, they're new enough that, you

490
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,400
know, we just don't have established knowledge theory or data that allows us to, to really

491
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,360
model these things well.

492
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:06,360
How has the, the product evolved like, what was your MVP and how have you iterated over

493
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,800
time to get to the platform that you have now?

494
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,400
So when we, when we first started, the MVP was my, my co-founder Bryce sitting behind

495
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:22,720
a keyboard, kind of manually tuning up machine learning models and in whatever appropriate

496
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,880
tool set worked at the time and, and really was working with primarily academic groups

497
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,040
to, to show that, that there might even be some value here, you know, most materials

498
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:39,680
companies see their, their development data as their crown jewels and, and I literally

499
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,440
every company they've talked to has referred to it that way and this is at this point hundreds

500
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,440
of companies.

501
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:49,440
And, and they're, the, the interesting thing about it is, you know, working with these

502
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,080
academic groups allowed us to really get an understanding of the development workflow

503
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:58,200
in a very open, open way.

504
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:03,360
What we realize though is that as we went into companies, there, there's this, uh, skits

505
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,640
of frenia to what they want.

506
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,520
On one hand, everyone is hungry to use AI in a new way.

507
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,960
Everyone is hungry to have AI be their savior in one way or another and, you know, I'm,

508
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,920
I don't need to tell you about the buzz in the industry, right?

509
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,880
You know, it's, it's on everybody's, uh, everybody's lips right now.

510
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,880
But the, the other side of it is in the materials and chemicals industry, the presence and,

511
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:31,160
and organization of data is actually in general quite poor, um, you know, there are only a few

512
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:37,240
different, uh, well, that there basically no company has a very large database, you

513
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,480
know, a lot of Google and search results or, you know, any Silicon Valley company and

514
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,880
their digital data, most materials companies have been collecting data on, you know, and

515
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,760
in manual logbooks for the better part of 50 or 100 years.

516
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,320
And so there's data out there, but in general, it's pretty tough to get at.

517
00:37:55,320 --> 00:38:00,120
And so actually what we've, what we've learned is that the AI tools are really nice and incredibly

518
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:04,800
powerful and, and drive a lot of value, but actually the first step as we work with people

519
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,560
is to go into these organizations and say, hey, you need to start organizing your data

520
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:15,080
in a way that makes it available to advanced analysis, whether it's AI or even just, you

521
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:21,960
know, very simple sorts of visualizations, um, and to actually go and, and build the platform

522
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,520
that will allow people to organize materials and data, uh, materials and chemistry data

523
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,880
in a rational way, uh, has been a layer of the platform we've had to, to build and continue

524
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,760
to refine because it turns out AI without any underlying data is not super useful.

525
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,520
Uh, and most of these companies don't have the, the sort of presence in house yet to, to

526
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,360
do that themselves. And so we had, we had to add this extra layer, which has been great

527
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:52,280
because what it means is as a company, we are able to both create sort of the instantaneous

528
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,640
value of we're helping you organize this stuff for the long term, we're helping you create

529
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,520
long term value. And then we also get to come in with the really cool AI results and say,

530
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,480
oh, by the way, we're helping you generate your next, you know, your next generation products

531
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,200
in, in five or seven business units and, and look at how cool these results are, look

532
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,400
at how excited your scientists are. So in some ways, you know, I think we've stumbled

533
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,720
into a really cool business here because we get to be an ally to everyone in the organization,

534
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:25,000
which is frankly usually rare in B2B businesses. Great. Well, uh, this has been super interesting.

535
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,400
Are there any additional thoughts that you'd like to share? You know, I think the, the,

536
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:35,880
the last thought I'd like to share is, is just that there's, you know, when we started

537
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,560
the company, people, we had, you know, we, we obviously have some great investors. We're

538
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,840
super excited about them. Um, but when we were originally pitching a great number of investors

539
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:49,920
said generalized AI is going to eat your lunch. That is the future and, and the specialty

540
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,920
domain specific stuff really is never going to have any value. And, and, and I think, you

541
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,320
know, I think you've seen, you know, just based on, on the, the guests in your show and,

542
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:07,120
you know, I know we've seen that the resurgence of domain specific AI has showed that AI is

543
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:13,080
an incredibly powerful tool. It's an incredible way to do a lot of, of fast tasks, faster

544
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:19,120
and it's an incredible way to kind of optimize how we behave in a lot of ways. But in materials

545
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:26,200
and chemistry, the, the domain specificity is incredibly important. And, and so as we've

546
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,280
kind of grown as a company, one thing I've realized is that, you know, kind of sharing

547
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,760
that message with people and understanding that, yeah, you know, what you can do with

548
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,920
scikit-learn is interesting. What you can do with these open source tools is interesting

549
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:43,320
and powerful. But if you really want to go deep, merging domain expertise and, and you

550
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:49,360
kind of AI expertise, ML expertise, if you can merge those effectively, you can have

551
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:54,640
a super powerful tool that's really differentiated from what anyone else has. And so I guess if I,

552
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,080
you know, kind of were to send a message to your listeners, it's, you know, you don't

553
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:05,760
have to be Andrew Ng to go and dominate the materials or to dominate a segment of AI.

554
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:10,120
You have to bring your world view and your expertise and combine it with a really effective

555
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:14,280
AI strategy. And that is the way to actually have real world impact. Or at least that's

556
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,680
what we've seen. And, and it's led to some really exciting results. And I couldn't be more

557
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,000
proud to have been part of this team, which is really a broken new ground in materials

558
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,160
and chemistry. Oh, that's awesome. Well, Greg, I really appreciate you taking the

559
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:32,320
time to share what you're up to. I will, I'm looking forward to kind of keeping track

560
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,840
of, of Citrine and the work that you're doing. Well, thanks a lot, Sam. It's been, it's

561
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:42,320
been awesome to be on. I love your show. And I've really enjoyed our chat this morning.
