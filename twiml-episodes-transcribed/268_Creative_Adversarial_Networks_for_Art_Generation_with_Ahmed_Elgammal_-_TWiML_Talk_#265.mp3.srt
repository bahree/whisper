00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:34,960
I'm your host, Sam Charrington, alright everyone, I am on the line with Ahmed El Gamal.

4
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,360
Ahmed is a professor in the Department of Computer Science at Rutgers University, as well

5
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,960
as director of the Art and Artificial Intelligence Lab there.

6
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,440
Ahmed, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

7
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,160
Thank you for inviting me.

8
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,280
Absolutely, I'd like to get started by having you share a little bit about your background

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:00,560
and what brought you to an interest in kind of the space of digital humanities and this

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:07,560
confluence of art and AI and more broadly your interests in computer vision.

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:14,720
Yes, so my career has been around artificial intelligence for a long time in particular

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,360
computer vision, I'm a computer vision person, but also I have a long version for art, for

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,840
long time.

14
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:32,640
And as a computer vision person, I always find it interesting that we, the vision look

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:41,720
at images and can you recognize cars and dogs and cats and men and women, he's like that.

16
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:49,520
But obviously, if you look at an artwork, that's not what we're looking for, it's much

17
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,520
deeper.

18
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,720
There are layers and layer of understanding of artworks that we do as human when you look

19
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:04,240
at artworks and also not only the understanding, but artwork effect us at the emotional level.

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,800
So it's much deeper than just what we do with the science and the vision.

21
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:19,400
That always intrigues me and that as an AI person, I also find it very, very interesting

22
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:26,000
and very fascinating because I believe that AI is not only about driving a car or

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,720
they just, in order to have a machine that is intelligent at the level of human intelligence,

24
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,320
the machine has to be able to understand these creative products like art and music and

25
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:45,480
literature and jokes and not only understand them, but be able to create them as well.

26
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,000
And this is not something new actually since the beginning of AI and the tone of AI scientists

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,200
has been trying to do that, I've been trying to create art and create music and understand

28
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,960
art and music, but it has been very challenging.

29
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:10,120
And I believe this is one of the important aspects to prove that AI is actually intelligent.

30
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:19,920
One of your recent projects is a tool called ICANN which is focused on generating art.

31
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,800
Can you talk a little bit about the genesis of that project and ultimately the capabilities

32
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,800
of that tool?

33
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Yes.

34
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:38,400
So in the last few years, GANN came around, which is an amazing tool to generate images

35
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,640
in particular, given some training sets.

36
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:50,640
So GANN by design is supposed to generate new samples of some distribution, if you give

37
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,640
it images of pets, it will try to generate more and more images of pets, and some people

38
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:04,680
have tried to use GANNs before to make art books like you give it portraits, Renaissance

39
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,120
portraits, for example, and try to generate these portraits.

40
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:12,520
However, our understanding of art is very different.

41
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,360
I believe that art is about innovation and making something novel.

42
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:21,000
So if you just generate samples from the same distribution of art that you give it, it's

43
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,760
not going to be art, it's not going to be called art, that's imitation of art.

44
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,160
So you have to be creative, you have to boost the machine to be creative.

45
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,440
There's a whole field of stuff in the AI called computational creativity, where scientists

46
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,400
in that GANN has been for a long time studying how to make the machine creative, how to make

47
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:50,040
a creative process, whether you are creating music or art or visual art or literature,

48
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,760
or drugs or anything like that.

49
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:59,880
So my goal is really was how can you change GANN to make it creative, not just simulating

50
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:08,720
the solution, but pushing the envelope of art to make something new, and then our long

51
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:15,760
study of these issues in the lab helped us into completing this problem.

52
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:21,800
So first we have to come up with a theory about how art evolved to start with, how artists

53
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,800
make new art, obviously these are theories or several theories about that.

54
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,960
The theory we use is coming from psychology by a scientist, his name is Colin Martin

55
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Dale.

56
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:41,080
So here's the question, look at history of art, what happened, why artists keep evolving

57
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:47,920
the styles as they go, why Baroque happened after Renaissance, and why impression is

58
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:54,120
not happening in 19th century, and why Cubism came after that, and it is just random or

59
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,880
there's something fundamental in how these styles illusion and evolve.

60
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:09,800
So basically, artists always has to generate new ideas in their art to push against what

61
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,200
is called habituation, because if we keep looking at the same art for a long time, it's

62
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:22,640
not interesting anymore as an artist, as a viewer, so artists has to always innovate.

63
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,520
However, this innovation has to come with what's called list effort, because if you innovate

64
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:37,840
too much in your art, unlikely that people will accept that, will be shocking for people.

65
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:44,400
So artists has to innovate to a certain degree, but with a limited amount of innovation, somehow

66
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,760
push against habituation, according to the list effort principle.

67
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:53,320
So that's exactly what we're trying to implement to make GANs creative.

68
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,080
So we develop what's called creative adversarial network, it's a variant of GAN that's really

69
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,280
designed to be implementing this concept.

70
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,360
So how can we make it innovative, or push the novelty, there are different ways to do

71
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
that.

72
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:15,760
In particular, we look at what's called style ambiguity, which is a process that relates

73
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,560
how artists break out style, so suppose, for example, you are an impressionist artist

74
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,560
living in the 19th century, making a lot of impressionist work.

75
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,440
After a while, you have exerted all possible things you can do within that style.

76
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:36,440
You have painted all possible facades, all these possible length games, all possible scenes

77
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:45,600
in that style, and at some time you already exerted all these possibilities, if you are a

78
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,040
new artist, even if you like that style, and you innovate, there is no room for innovation

79
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,640
anymore within that style.

80
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:57,720
So that's basically the reason why most artists at certain points break out style and create

81
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
something new.

82
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,240
Coming up was something new, like, for example, Tzan at the time, or Van Gogh at the time

83
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,600
trying to break out of ambitionism and do what's called after that was the ambitionism.

84
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,360
So that's exactly what we're trying to do here.

85
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:17,480
How can we digest what having artistry to certain points, to some certain points, and break

86
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,560
out of style to create something new?

87
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,200
Can I jump into it with a question, and this may lead you into what you actually did.

88
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:31,600
But when I think about what you're proposing that we develop a model of the way artists

89
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:38,680
generated, and in this case, the model kind of supposes that the artist lives within some

90
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:49,240
style, but there are maybe kind of random pushes of the envelope, if you will, or maybe

91
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,000
they're not random, but an individual artist innovates, but not too much.

92
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,040
I kind of get that as a simplistic model for the evolution of art.

93
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,720
But it does seem like coming up with some kind of representation for that and how that happens

94
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,280
would be very complex computationally.

95
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Yes, definitely.

96
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,440
You have to simplify it.

97
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,720
And that's what we managed to do at least to certain degree.

98
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,240
We suppose we give the machine lots and lots of images of art.

99
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,120
What we did was we give it art from the last 500 years of Western canon of art history.

100
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,120
And we only give the machine the artworks and the style of each artwork according to

101
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:47,720
styles from art and history and like Renaissance Baroque, imperialism, all these art movements

102
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,520
that happened.

103
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,080
So this is the only thing that the machine gives the machine, the images of the art and

104
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,920
these labels.

105
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:05,760
So the formulation here is that we want the generator, we want to put the generator under two opposing

106
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,480
courses in one hand, like a chemical gun, if we need to learn the distribution of art,

107
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,480
right?

108
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,960
We need something from that distribution.

109
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,880
But that would be only imitation, right?

110
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,120
So how can you push it to be innovative?

111
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,960
So we added what we call style ambiguity.

112
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:27,040
We want to basically, the generator generates something that follows the distribution but

113
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,320
doesn't follow the existing styles at all.

114
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,520
So in order to do that, the discriminator here has to be equipped with a stylist's fire.

115
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:43,320
So the estimator has to be able to tell for any new artwork what style is it, is it

116
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,800
Renaissance, is Baroque, is it Ubism, is it abstract.

117
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,800
So the generator job here is to find out a solution that generate images, follow the

118
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,160
general aesthetics of art, follow the same distribution of art.

119
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,640
But in the same time, doesn't follow any existing styles because if it generated another

120
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,560
ambitionist art or another, a cubism art, you're going to get been allowed.

121
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,920
So you see the dilemma here, so it has to generate something that fits the aesthetics in

122
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,160
general, but doesn't fit existing style.

123
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:24,440
And that what needed to innovate in style, but follow the aesthetics doesn't really make

124
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:28,520
something shockingly random that people won't accept.

125
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:32,920
And we see that right away in the generation, what it generates is always following the

126
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,160
style, following the aesthetics so you can see a good choice of colors, a good choice

127
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,280
of composition rules, variety of texture, but in the same time, you can not easily put

128
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,480
what it generates into any existing style.

129
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,440
It doesn't repeat what happened before, we don't see anything that looked like Renaissance

130
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,000
or a cubism art or a cubism art, we can always see that it innovates and try to make something

131
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,520
new out of that.

132
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:06,160
So these two forces actually kind of boost the innovation, but limit the innovation at

133
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,160
the same time because we bullet back to the distribution of art, so it doesn't go straight

134
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,080
and start generating random things that's going to be too innovative.

135
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:27,160
How do you kind of enforce this rule to maintain the aesthetic, but not the style within the

136
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,160
GAN?

137
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,960
Basically, the loss function of the GAN, we change the loss function of the GAN such that

138
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,880
it has these two opposing losses.

139
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:45,280
In one hand, it has a typical GAN loss, which is try to generate images from the distribution

140
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:52,280
of the real fake loss as usually in a GAN setting, so it is, that's incentive to be within

141
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:58,040
the aesthetics, but in the same time, we have the style ambiguity loss, which is basically

142
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:05,720
based on the style classifier of that denominator, we compute some sort of entropy score out

143
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:13,720
of that style classifier, and we basically try to maximize this style ambiguity.

144
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:22,240
So in one hand, when I minimize the divergent from the distribution of art, but in the same

145
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,560
time when I maximize the ambiguity of the style, so this implemented the two opposing forces.

146
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:34,280
Okay, and now is the loss function, when it's evaluated, is that a scalar, and I guess

147
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,440
what I'm asking you is, do you have this issue where you have these two opposing components

148
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,160
of your loss function that just average out and kind of you lose all of the information

149
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,680
and the nuance in the two different components, or is that not an issue here?

150
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
That is exactly what it's trying to do.

151
00:13:51,680 --> 00:14:00,080
I mean, it tries to find out both in the surface of the optimization that you are doing that

152
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,080
in between the two.

153
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,000
You want to minimize one, maximize the other, so it has to find some sweet spot between

154
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
the two.

155
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,160
I'm curious about the training process you've got.

156
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,360
How many images did you train the Gannon?

157
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:25,800
Yeah, the first version we did, it was about 80,000 images from last 500 years of Western

158
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:32,720
art, about 20 different styles that we used at starting from my sons to all the way

159
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:40,160
to contemporary art, almost tiny form among all the styles, make sure that we don't have

160
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:47,560
any bias in the data, so roughly all the styles are in uniform number.

161
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:54,760
So the interesting thing was that under distance trains, we find that the machine tends to generate

162
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:02,680
more and more abstract works, less figurative artworks, and more abstract works for

163
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,400
that, which is very interesting.

164
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Why is that?

165
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:15,280
I mean, why they would generate abstract artworks and not figurative artwork?

166
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,200
We kept thinking about that for a long time, so why is that?

167
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:25,840
But when we look at the progression of history of art, one thing we find interesting in the

168
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:32,480
results is that the machine under distance trains that we put in generate more and more

169
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,360
abstract artworks and less and less figurative, we hardly see any portraits or any landscape

170
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
generated.

171
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:46,760
It's more about more abstract and more, it's a little bit surrealist nature.

172
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:51,680
So we were wondering why is that, why the machine generates more abstract?

173
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,320
However, if you look at art history and look at the progression art history, at least

174
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:03,000
some other research we have done also, we actually find that it's clear that art history moves

175
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,200
into a trajectory from a figurative art through the history in the last five centuries until

176
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:17,640
we reached the 20th century, where artists move into abstraction and very beautiful abstraction,

177
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:25,480
then later into a color field painting and abstract exhibitionism and contemporary art.

178
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,680
So there is a clear trajectory of art moving away from figurative art into abstraction,

179
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,080
which basically seems that the machine here figured out that there is this trajectory

180
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:44,760
and in order to create novel art, it has to be more into the abstract realm of art.

181
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,680
So under this constraint that we put into the formulation, it seemed that finding a good

182
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:57,480
solution, abstract art provides more good solution that fits these two constraints.

183
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,960
Because if it's a figurative art, it probably gonna generate things that looks like Renaissance

184
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:12,000
or Baroque or other classical styles, so it didn't analyze why for abstract art, I think

185
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,800
there's a lot of room for experiment for the machine or results that machine can generate

186
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,720
that doesn't really fit into existing styles that easy.

187
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:26,160
So it's seen that's why the machine is getting more and more of these abstract works.

188
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:32,760
The website is aicanicand.io and we'll put a link in the show notes.

189
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:38,160
I definitely, you know, the abstract nature of the results are very apparent.

190
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:43,040
But I think about kind of the, you know, art that might be generated by again, what comes

191
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:49,280
to mind is more like the, if you remember back in 2012, this woman tried to do a hand

192
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:57,920
restoration of this Spanish fresco echihomo and basically made it look really, really

193
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,280
bad.

194
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,200
And that's kind of what I think of when you kind of think of ganger-erated images, at

195
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:11,760
least, you know, the gans are getting a lot better now, but these are decidedly abstract.

196
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:19,400
And in fact, you have a gallery on the site that's kind of the 2017 version of the, of

197
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:30,640
Ican and then a 27, 8, 2018 version of Ican and just kind of comparing the two visually.

198
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,020
And I'd like you to comment on, you know, the, whether, you know, this could be kind of

199
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:40,040
selection bias, you handpicked, you know, the images kind of differently or something.

200
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,600
But the, the art is much better in the gallery that you're displaying for 2018.

201
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,840
Is that characteristic of the, the second version of the model's results or did you just

202
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,240
pick better art for the website?

203
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:59,200
And no, just physically we change more and more data for longer time and it gets, it

204
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,040
is affecting the, the process, so that's why it's getting better.

205
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:08,320
And that's, that's maybe not, you know, not intuitive that, you know, I would almost expect

206
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,880
maybe that a counterintuitive result or the opposite result, you train it, you know, with

207
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:23,720
more, if you're training it with more historical art that it would tend more towards kind of

208
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,120
reproducing what it sees then to get further out into abstraction, if that makes any sense.

209
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,640
That's absolutely not, that's a whole idea that, that, again, we'll do that.

210
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:38,920
Again, we'll definitely try, if you get more data and more training it will emulate the

211
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
data better.

212
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:45,240
But, exactly, but what we doing here is the variant that we drive, which is creative at

213
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,600
the cellular network, which is, by definition, it doesn't try to generate anything that existed

214
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:56,160
before, because if you generate things that stimulate what existed before that get, get,

215
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,440
get been alive because of the style ambiguity, but of the loss, so it has to generate something

216
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:07,040
that doesn't fit existing style at all, but follows the aesthetics, that's why it's always

217
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:14,040
has tried to generate things that are not holding into existing styles, and that's why

218
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,320
bush, bush, bush the creativity of the, of the result.

219
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:26,240
So having more data will, will, will, will not make it emulate the results by definition,

220
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,600
because we, it still have to innovate according to the loss.

221
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,360
And actually, let me discuss this, according to your question, why this is different from

222
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,880
GANs, GINID images, of course.

223
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:47,040
Exactly, if you, if you look at most of our GINID by using GANs, especially maybe a year

224
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:52,440
or two years old, now GANs getting better, if you give it a board trace, for example,

225
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:58,720
as training sets, it will generate what's, what's looks like the form of board trace, right?

226
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:06,920
So you can see kind of, Francis Bacon, the form of style of board trace in the generation,

227
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:15,400
specifically, GAN images that you see in several artists, the genetic art using GANs

228
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,000
are having this characteristic.

229
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,960
So what happens in that case is actually, the GANs are not successful in generating good

230
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,480
board trace.

231
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,840
So the GAN actually fails in generating the board trace correctly, and, and because of

232
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:35,000
the deformation, that's why you will find it interesting.

233
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,240
So it surprised you because of the deformation, and that surprise is why you might like it,

234
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,000
or might not like it as a viewer.

235
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:51,040
That's why, that's, I mean aesthetics in GANs, genetic images, the element of deformation

236
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:54,960
or failure to imitate the training data.

237
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,280
So, and that's exactly what we've pointed out in our academic paper, when we derived

238
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:07,720
the PICAN, is that we, we thought, we think of this failure to imitate the solution as

239
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,120
a failure case, not a creative process.

240
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,120
The machine here is not intentionally deforming the image.

241
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,640
The machine is just failing to imitate the poetry.

242
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,960
For us as a viewer, it's interesting thing to look at.

243
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,720
But the process here is not creative.

244
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,760
The process here is a, a, a emulative process that just failed, right?

245
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:33,320
And that's totally what, not what we are trying to do, we're trying to really make it

246
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:38,280
be constructive in being creative, meaning that the machine in our case in, in, when we

247
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:43,200
We do a hand, but the machine from the beginning

248
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,320
trying to generate something that have these two constraints

249
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,280
both into place follows the aesthetic,

250
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,760
but doesn't follow existing style.

251
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:54,560
So with these two constraints,

252
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,200
the machine has to find a solution

253
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
that satisfies these two constraints.

254
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,840
Art history, if you look at the way art history progress

255
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:03,960
over time, there is a quote from an art historian,

256
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,880
his name is Henry Walbren, who say that style

257
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,080
has to evolve in a smooth way, like a rock rolling down a hill.

258
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,400
Meaning that first, a style doesn't jump.

259
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,640
We cannot have renaissance moving into ambitionism

260
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,640
and moving that to Baroque and then moving to realism.

261
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,240
No, it doesn't happen this way.

262
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,920
Style moves in a very slowly over time

263
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:32,640
from renaissance to Baroque to in a very ordered way.

264
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,480
So if you boost the machine to generate something that

265
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,840
doesn't fit existing styles, but keep the aesthetic

266
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,600
it cannot find a solution by mixing out, for example,

267
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,880
renaissance and Baroque or mixing out Baroque and

268
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,840
ambitionism or try to find something in between.

269
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,680
There is no way to find something in between a solution.

270
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,800
So the only way for the machine to solve this problem

271
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,640
is really to extrapolate on that trajectory,

272
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,960
figure out that is a trajectory of how art progressed

273
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,000
and then generate something on top of that.

274
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,760
And that's why Jeanette Moore and more abstract works.

275
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,440
So by construction here, as the machine has a creative

276
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,840
process in terms of generating the art,

277
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,920
it doesn't emulate, it has to always innovate.

278
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,560
And the source of aesthetics of what you see

279
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,840
is this creative process is not the failure

280
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,440
through which you need something from the data set.

281
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,160
It's not the failure to generate a board tree.

282
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,360
It's not a failure to generate a landscape.

283
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,440
The real aesthetics here coming from the fact

284
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,960
it's followed the aesthetics rules, learning the ethics rules,

285
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,640
but try to constructively be constructively

286
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,240
generating something new.

287
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,440
Yeah, I'm not sure I fully understand that.

288
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,840
So what I hear you saying is you've got this,

289
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,480
the history of art is this progression or sequence of styles.

290
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,160
And what your can kind of creative adversarial network

291
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,680
is creating is something that is art

292
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,720
that doesn't exist kind of between two styles,

293
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,320
but kind of by definition projects out

294
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,480
from kind of the last element of that sequence.

295
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,080
And maybe you're just speaking figuratively,

296
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,440
and I'm trying to be too literal or rigorous about this.

297
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,480
But why is that necessarily the case?

298
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,640
Why is it that the things that we're seeing

299
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,840
are not kind of orthogonal to the sequence of styles

300
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,240
that we've seen?

301
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,160
Yeah, it's a good question.

302
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,840
Yes, it can.

303
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,040
It can be.

304
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,720
Because at the end, I mean, we, the machine-strike solution

305
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,520
giving the constraint we give it.

306
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,200
But let me bring you out to another piece of research

307
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,920
that we have done.

308
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:50,040
In another research, we looked at what representation

309
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:55,720
the machine learns if we teach it to classify styles.

310
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,840
So we give the machine lots of images and style labels

311
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,520
and train lots of new networks to classify styles,

312
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:05,200
such as to try and classify whether the art is very

313
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,800
sounds borrowed, ambition is man, and so on.

314
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,360
Just like classification.

315
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,640
But then what we looked at, we looked at what representation

316
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,520
the machine learned.

317
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,640
So we look at the activation of the fully committed layers

318
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,360
and in this network and look at things

319
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,760
like the principal component analysis of these activitions

320
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,640
and the manifold of activation and things like that.

321
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,600
And to our surprise, when you look at this,

322
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,600
we find that the machine arranged the data

323
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,520
in a chronological order by itself.

324
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,640
Interesting.

325
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,400
Yeah, we never give the machine anything

326
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,240
about the date of the artwork or that any sounds

327
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,720
happened before Baroque or Baroque happened before Cubism

328
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,840
or Embritionism.

329
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,520
We found that when you look at two-dimension plots

330
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,520
of the data, Renaissance comes first, followed by Baroque,

331
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,000
followed by 17th century art.

332
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,680
And then comes 19th century art realism and Embritionism

333
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:13,400
and then move to Cezanne and move to Cubism and abstract.

334
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,400
By itself.

335
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,800
Amazing. I mean, you can find that the machine actually,

336
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,480
the art has evolved into a full circle

337
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,720
going from Renaissance all the way to 20th century

338
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,720
in a very smooth way.

339
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,680
And the machine discovered that by itself.

340
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
Interesting.

341
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:31,000
I was going to ask what happens if you tell the network

342
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,720
kind of the sequence by feeding in dates,

343
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,240
but it sounds like you don't have to it, figures it out.

344
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,760
Exactly, exactly.

345
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,760
And that exactly explains why the machine actually generated

346
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,760
art that is more figurative and more abstract at the end.

347
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,600
Can you elaborate a little bit on how you got

348
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,600
to this two-dimensional or kind of time representation

349
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,560
or sequential representation from the activations?

350
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,840
Yeah, so basically we look at the activation space

351
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,960
and look at the modes of variation,

352
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,840
the principal component analysis of this activation space.

353
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,200
And what we find that first, you can explain

354
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,840
almost 95% of the variance of the data

355
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,280
using very few number of components

356
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,960
in the activation space, usually five, six components

357
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,040
in all the networks that you have seen.

358
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,840
And actually the first two dimensions,

359
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,400
the first two modes of variation captured

360
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,360
about 70% of the variance.

361
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,720
And if you plot the data against these two modes of variation,

362
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,720
you can always clearly see this chronological progression

363
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,440
from 14th century till now,

364
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,440
where if you go radially across clockwise, across that

365
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,680
to the emission plot, it has about 70% correlation

366
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,880
with time.

367
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,240
So the machine figured out this smooth transition by itself,

368
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:11,360
which basically tells us that one thing we already know

369
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,360
from art history is that style progress in a very smooth way,

370
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,760
it doesn't progress in random ways,

371
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,520
it progressed in a very smooth way.

372
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,480
And that's what the machine was figured out by itself.

373
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,480
If I were to create a model for the evolution of art,

374
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,320
being someone who's probably as far as you can get

375
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,040
from someone who knows anything about this,

376
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:40,240
but I would kind of evolve the model that you've described

377
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,960
where you've got these kind of styles

378
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,400
and then these perturbations in aesthetic

379
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:52,520
or perturbations in, how did you describe that earlier?

380
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,000
That kind of the simple model for the way art evolves?

381
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,480
You wanna boost innovation

382
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,520
and there are multiple ways to boost innovation,

383
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,360
but you wanna boost innovation in a least amount

384
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,480
or least with least effort.

385
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,640
Right, right, right.

386
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,640
So you've got this style that has evolved

387
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,480
and you kind of innovate in these small incremental ways.

388
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,280
And I guess what's missing for that for me is,

389
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,480
it strikes me that you have a lot of that

390
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,360
and then you have these kind of big step function innovations

391
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,720
that are much more dramatic than the small random innovations.

392
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,560
Is that just not true from the kind of research

393
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,880
into the evolution of art or is that possible

394
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,520
further extension of work like this

395
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,000
to incorporate that type of model?

396
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,320
Actually, what you're saying is true.

397
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,320
There are different ways artists innovate in their work.

398
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,000
They can innovate within the style

399
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,880
and they can break out of style.

400
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,280
And this is something that Martin Delecchi pointed out.

401
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:05,360
Most artists work within a style,

402
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,280
meaning that there is a predominant style

403
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,880
at any time in history.

404
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,200
And most artists just work within that style.

405
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,400
Like if you are in 17th century,

406
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,360
probably you're gonna do Baroque.

407
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,720
That's what's happening and everybody is doing

408
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,880
within the rules of Baroque style.

409
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,000
But what happened is at certain points,

410
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
artists really are a good board of these schools

411
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,080
that they are working with

412
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,520
because they tried all possible subject matter

413
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:40,240
within that style and there's no room for innovation anymore.

414
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,480
When you're working within the style,

415
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,720
the only way you innovate is to look

416
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,760
at different subject matter within the style.

417
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,080
You can try the different story,

418
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,440
different scene, different things,

419
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,320
but everything within the style rules.

420
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,480
But at certain points, you exerted all these possibilities.

421
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,560
And then that's where really important artists

422
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,240
come up with new break out of the style.

423
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,200
That's what happened, for example,

424
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,000
when Picasso broke out of what's happened

425
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
and painted ladies of Avignon, for example, in 1907.

426
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,800
And that was too innovative at that time.

427
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,080
And it led to the beginning of Cubism

428
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,320
or earlier when Monk bended the scream

429
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,400
and early works of exhibitionism.

430
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,200
So there are always certain artists who break out of style

431
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,200
and other artists are to copy these new styles

432
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,800
and follow their direction.

433
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:46,040
And that's the kind of innovation we plugged in

434
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,840
into the formulation of Can,

435
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,360
which is the style ambiguity.

436
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,320
We don't want an machine to generate something

437
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,040
that fits existing style.

438
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,080
Because if it generates something that fits existing style,

439
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:01,520
it's the entropy, there would be no surprise.

440
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,760
The entropy would be very low for that bottle of the loss

441
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,800
and we're trying to maximize that more.

442
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,360
But the machine has to always generate something

443
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,960
that the classifier, the discriminator,

444
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,960
cannot classify, be almost uniform in terms of classifying

445
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,960
that style according to the styles that you give the machine.

446
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,240
So that's where the style ambiguity gets maximized.

447
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,040
Okay, interesting.

448
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,960
So I'm curious, this working creativity

449
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,880
is kind of one area of interest of yours.

450
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,680
Were there any principles or observations

451
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,880
that you made in working on this project

452
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,880
that kind of informed your broader work in computer vision?

453
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,640
I have been focused more and more into that area

454
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,760
for the last maybe six, seven years

455
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,360
to really understand more how to make the machine understand art.

456
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,760
And so the generation of art is something that came

457
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,760
actually out of long progress into understanding this concept.

458
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,160
So the earlier works that we have done in that area

459
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,040
those things like how to classify styles,

460
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,920
how to classify the genre of art, how to classify artists,

461
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,200
how to look at artistic influences

462
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,400
and even you have worked earlier

463
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,840
on how to quantify creativity in artwork.

464
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,960
Like can you tell, can you look at art history

465
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:30,680
and look at images only and their time stamps

466
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:35,680
and find out artworks that were creative in their time.

467
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:40,680
And actually we find that the machine by some formulation

468
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,080
really what's called network centrality

469
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,520
could figure out important piece of art

470
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,120
to art history just by looking at images of art

471
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,960
and their dates without knowing anything else about styles

472
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,440
or about artists or anything like that.

473
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,360
So the machine figure out for example things like

474
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,160
Picasso's ladies have been known

475
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,440
or a monk's theme or Monet's tag

476
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,440
has fundamental important pieces of artwork in history.

477
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,360
And that lead us, that lead us actually

478
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,320
to formulating the creative adversarial network

479
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:20,840
as a variant of GAN that has this built in process

480
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,840
of style ambiguity as a constraint

481
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,560
that help pushing the machine to be creative

482
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,640
and innovative.

483
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,480
Interesting.

484
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,720
So really, really interesting work.

485
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,720
How do you see this work evolving?

486
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,560
What's next?

487
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,600
What's next is you are focused now on our focus now

488
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,760
and how to, what we've proved is basically that the machine

489
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,480
can, we can give the machine all this art history

490
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,960
without any curation just to give it all art history

491
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,360
and it can generate almost autonomously new artworks

492
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,360
that what we achieved.

493
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,000
So that's a proof concept that machine

494
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,400
can reduce things autonomously to some degree.

495
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,600
But what we really want to do is to give artists

496
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,680
a control over the process.

497
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,320
How can artists control this generation

498
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,840
to achieve something that they want to do,

499
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,360
not just make it autonomous?

500
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,920
And that's really what we try to do now,

501
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,880
how to make it more collaborative and more controllable.

502
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,000
Fantastic, fantastic.

503
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,600
