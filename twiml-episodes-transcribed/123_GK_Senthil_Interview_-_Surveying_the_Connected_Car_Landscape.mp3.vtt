Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

00:16.320 --> 00:21.480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:21.480 --> 00:32.280
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:32.280 --> 00:38.240
In this episode I'm joined by GK Centil, director and chief product owner for innovation at Toyota

00:38.240 --> 00:39.720
Connected.

00:39.720 --> 00:44.280
GK and I spoke about opportunities and challenges for smart cars.

00:44.280 --> 00:48.040
We discussed Toyota's recently announced partnership with Amazon to embed Alexa in

00:48.040 --> 00:53.200
vehicles and more generally the approach they're taking to get connected car technology

00:53.200 --> 00:58.720
up to par with smartphones and other intelligent devices we use on a daily basis.

00:58.720 --> 01:03.240
We cover in-car voice recognition and touch on the ways that machine learning and AI need

01:03.240 --> 01:08.400
to be developed to be useful in vehicles as well as the approaches for getting there.

01:08.400 --> 01:10.760
And now on to the show.

01:10.760 --> 01:19.400
All right everyone, I am on the line with GK Centil.

01:19.400 --> 01:23.720
GK is chief product owner for innovation at Toyota Connected.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.560
GK, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

01:26.560 --> 01:29.520
I'm glad to be here, sir.

01:29.520 --> 01:33.000
Why don't we get started by having you tell us a little bit about how you got involved

01:33.000 --> 01:35.680
in AI there at Toyota?

01:35.680 --> 01:36.680
Sure.

01:36.680 --> 01:41.680
My background is in software engineering, I've been in this field for about 18 years.

01:41.680 --> 01:46.040
I did my bachelors in electronics and communication.

01:46.040 --> 01:52.120
So for the last seven years or so, I'm fully involved in connected cars.

01:52.120 --> 01:59.600
Connected cars come in all shapes and sizes and my relationship with Toyota was since 2011

01:59.600 --> 02:04.280
and I've been with Hyundai and Toyota on and off in the last few years.

02:04.280 --> 02:10.480
So in the past year or so, I've taken a lead on this group within Toyota Connected called

02:10.480 --> 02:18.000
Innovation, which the objective of this is to find new products, new services, new ideas

02:18.000 --> 02:21.520
to enhance the connected car experience for our customers.

02:21.520 --> 02:27.840
And so that's where we started off with the machine learning and AI in terms of looking

02:27.840 --> 02:33.720
at conversational interfaces for our customers in various endpoints.

02:33.720 --> 02:41.320
And that's really how the involvement with AI and ML started and we've been doing few

02:41.320 --> 02:46.920
different things in that area for the past nine months to an year.

02:46.920 --> 02:52.720
It's pretty incredible how just a few years ago, we would think of the autumn, at least

02:52.720 --> 02:57.960
those of us, or I guess I should just say myself, I don't know about anyone else, but

02:57.960 --> 03:05.960
I would think about cars as not very technology-forward things, right?

03:05.960 --> 03:11.960
You kind of have these built-in consoles that were many years behind what you get every

03:11.960 --> 03:19.720
day with your phone and it seems like the industry is really waking up to the opportunity and

03:19.720 --> 03:25.720
really the way consumers want to integrate technology kind of across through their lives.

03:25.720 --> 03:30.200
Yes, I don't know, how do you think about the role of the connected car?

03:30.200 --> 03:36.480
Yes, I'm going to say, tell me about it, right?

03:36.480 --> 03:43.080
It's been a topic of everybody who's been using smartphones for the last few years in

03:43.080 --> 03:47.520
the sense that they have this piece of technology that's sitting in their hands, that does various

03:47.520 --> 03:53.000
things and then they go into the cars and what they see is really several years behind

03:53.000 --> 04:00.200
like you said, in terms of not just the technology, it's also the user interface, how it behaves

04:00.200 --> 04:07.080
and how it really helps customers carry on their connected lives into the vehicle.

04:07.080 --> 04:15.040
So we all certainly know that cars have a much bigger role to play or can provide much

04:15.040 --> 04:18.400
better experience when it comes to connected lives.

04:18.400 --> 04:26.920
Which, American, I heard probably commutes about 10 hours a week or 6 to 10 hours a week,

04:26.920 --> 04:31.200
so that's a waste of opportunity right now.

04:31.200 --> 04:38.560
And without having this fixed, what we see is more accidents, more distractions, having

04:38.560 --> 04:42.280
customers trying to use their smartphone as a replacement for an in-makel device, it's

04:42.280 --> 04:44.640
not really designed to be.

04:44.640 --> 04:51.240
And I believe there is plenty of things that we can do to improve that and not just make

04:51.240 --> 04:56.240
use of this time in a effective way, so customers are not distracted, so safety is one aspect

04:56.240 --> 04:57.240
of this.

04:57.240 --> 05:04.480
The other aspect is essentially making this time a lot more productive, a lot more joyful

05:04.480 --> 05:11.640
in the driving experience, we still wait for autonomous cars which may take 10 or more

05:11.640 --> 05:15.960
years to become mainstream, I think we still have a lot more to do in the connected car

05:15.960 --> 05:17.280
world.

05:17.280 --> 05:26.280
One of the ways that the various car manufacturers have tried to allow us to safely engage with

05:26.280 --> 05:31.120
our vehicles is through voice interfaces, and this is again one of those experiences

05:31.120 --> 05:36.360
where, you know, for a few years now, like the phone kind of voice interaction experiences

05:36.360 --> 05:43.200
was way ahead of the car interactive voice interface.

05:43.200 --> 05:47.920
But the cars are now talking about, I guess I see a couple of different strategies.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.760
One is just kind of advancing the technology.

05:50.760 --> 05:58.600
The other is just wholesale outsourcing it to things like Alexa or other companies versions

05:58.600 --> 06:00.400
of those things.

06:00.400 --> 06:08.160
How does that landscape look to you and what's the approach to that at Toyota?

06:08.160 --> 06:13.680
Yeah, I think you reached the core of this, you know, current technology landscape in

06:13.680 --> 06:16.720
terms of, you know, how it's going to pan out.

06:16.720 --> 06:22.200
You're right, the existing versions of voice recognition, you know, operate on, you

06:22.200 --> 06:26.640
know, predefined phrases, and you have to be in a certain application in a certain screen

06:26.640 --> 06:31.760
to use certain words to utilize voice recognition, it's very frustrating.

06:31.760 --> 06:37.880
I haven't seen anybody actively using it successfully in their cars, you know, and we spend

06:37.880 --> 06:43.040
a lot of money on this, so to actually put this in the cars, but unfortunately, it's

06:43.040 --> 06:45.440
not really useful.

06:45.440 --> 06:50.160
So the next wave is obviously, you know, taking from the home experience where we have these

06:50.160 --> 06:55.840
virtual assistants sitting in terms of, you know, what you see as Alexa or Google Assistant.

06:55.840 --> 07:00.160
So, and of course, the smartphones provide similar experience, so customers want to carry

07:00.160 --> 07:01.480
that over.

07:01.480 --> 07:06.840
And that's obviously the next wave of the experience that's the, you know, the customers

07:06.840 --> 07:12.600
need in the car and what we also want to provide in the car, which is, you know, fully natural

07:12.600 --> 07:19.720
language, you know, conversational dialogue oriented, you know, use in, you know, it understands

07:19.720 --> 07:25.680
the context, it understands, you know, what your habits and provides response. So voice is

07:25.680 --> 07:30.480
definitely the key aspect of understanding what the customer needs.

07:30.480 --> 07:34.920
The technology that Google and Alexa brings and how that's going to fit in the car, you

07:34.920 --> 07:38.440
know, whether the automakers are going to outsource to these players.

07:38.440 --> 07:42.000
I think there are few key things to understand.

07:42.000 --> 07:45.560
So the vehicle is not a smartphone equivalent.

07:45.560 --> 07:50.400
I think there are a lot of misconceptions. Yes, in a way, it is an extension of your digital

07:50.400 --> 07:55.680
life. It's another device. It's an electronic screen. So there is some comparison there.

07:55.680 --> 08:01.000
But also vehicle, you know, you are actually using it for driving from point A to point

08:01.000 --> 08:06.480
B. It's not a thousand dollar device. It's a $30,000 device or $40,000 device.

08:06.480 --> 08:07.480
Right.

08:07.480 --> 08:13.560
So as a customer, you know, I should be able to comfortably use my vehicle through my

08:13.560 --> 08:17.800
muscle memory. And there are a lot of things when it comes to just the user experience.

08:17.800 --> 08:26.360
How the customer interacts with a car versus a phone. So I believe it's a hybrid of, you

08:26.360 --> 08:32.480
know, the technology that Google or Amazon provides with respect to their assistance and deep

08:32.480 --> 08:39.640
integration into what the vehicle can do and, you know, how the vehicle ecosystem works.

08:39.640 --> 08:44.920
I think a hybrid of these would provide the best of experience to the customer. And we

08:44.920 --> 08:50.080
are ready to, we are actively working on this. We're actively looking into various aspects

08:50.080 --> 08:56.040
from, you know, user experience to data protection to privacy and, you know, all these different

08:56.040 --> 09:00.880
aspects on how this, you know, what the exact model that's going to help the customers.

09:00.880 --> 09:06.400
Ultimately, that's the aim here to help the customer. So if you look at deep vehicle

09:06.400 --> 09:11.520
integration, we have access to the vehicle, you know, controllers, the data that comes

09:11.520 --> 09:19.600
out of the vehicle, you know, we know how driving works. We know automotive. So the virtual

09:19.600 --> 09:25.160
assistant in the car has to be able to take advantage of that needs to know, you know,

09:25.160 --> 09:33.200
okay, my gasoline or fuel tank is just, you know, 10% more and should I suggest a gas

09:33.200 --> 09:38.720
station nearby. And this is data that we have about the car and we know that customer,

09:38.720 --> 09:42.800
you know, typically prefers filling it in the last minute versus, you know, some customer

09:42.800 --> 09:48.920
that, you know, really talking about filling the gas tank when it's just quarter more.

09:48.920 --> 09:54.400
So all these have to be taken into consideration building this experience.

09:54.400 --> 09:59.520
Can you give some other examples of kind of how the, you know, when you think of this,

09:59.520 --> 10:08.600
like hybrid experience that enables use cases that's not really attainable by just pulling

10:08.600 --> 10:14.480
in a third party thing like an Alexa, what are the things that like most jump out at you?

10:14.480 --> 10:19.320
I think there are, you know, most customers when you when you are in the car, you know,

10:19.320 --> 10:23.440
three main things. So navigation, you want to go from, you know, one place to another

10:23.440 --> 10:27.760
place, you want to find, you know, interesting places to go or restaurants to go. So it's,

10:27.760 --> 10:32.720
you know, can put everything under navigation. Definitely media consumption, whether it's

10:32.720 --> 10:37.440
music or podcasts or, you know, anything that you do in the car takes up majority of your

10:37.440 --> 10:43.520
time. And then communication, which is, you know, just essentially messaging, which is,

10:43.520 --> 10:48.800
which is one of the most distracting aspects of vehicle. So these three key areas, you

10:48.800 --> 10:53.520
know, I firmly believe it needs to be customized for the vehicle and how the vehicle operates

10:53.520 --> 10:59.600
and, you know, how you interact with your steering wheel switches another tactical knobs in a way.

10:59.600 --> 11:06.480
So these are some of the areas which could be done well by both the, you know, OEMs,

11:06.480 --> 11:12.160
the automotive OEMs and the players that are out there. So this is something that needs to be

11:12.160 --> 11:17.200
carefully considered on how we do. The vehicle specific use case, one I already mentioned like

11:17.200 --> 11:23.040
about knowing your fuel levels. The other could be about your driving behaviors, right? So,

11:23.040 --> 11:28.640
you know, there are use cases where you could actually essentially coach the, coach the driver on

11:29.280 --> 11:35.920
how their driving is, you know, take their emotions in future, you know, could be facial recognition.

11:35.920 --> 11:42.400
Are they tired? Are they sleepy? You know, are they frustrated? Are they driving it a little bit

11:42.400 --> 11:47.840
more rashly? You know, we can detect all this. And so it's not, then it becomes not just

11:47.840 --> 11:54.400
why it becomes multimodal, right? So you're essentially being an assistant, listening,

11:54.400 --> 12:00.000
observing and, you know, providing some suggestions. And this requires inputs from multiple

12:00.000 --> 12:07.040
vehicle sensors and knowing how the customer drives, right? And what are the different reactions

12:07.040 --> 12:13.120
in the vehicle systems that are causing this to provide, you know, and this could ultimately save

12:13.120 --> 12:20.880
lives or save time or so. Those are the examples I could think of, but, you know, vehicle has,

12:22.000 --> 12:26.960
you know, various aspects to it when it comes to a life cycle of a customer on how they use the

12:26.960 --> 12:33.760
vehicle. So things that you could see like service, right? After like maintenance. So your oil

12:33.760 --> 12:39.280
quality is low. Do you want to take it for an oil change? So these are some other examples where

12:39.280 --> 12:45.440
you integrate with the dealership or ecosystem. And that's something where we can, we can provide a

12:45.440 --> 12:54.800
lot more oil, a lot of oil through the system. What kind of approaches are you taking to, to kind

12:54.800 --> 13:03.280
of get there? So without talking about any secret sauce, like I said, we're looking at, you know,

13:03.280 --> 13:09.200
from a plain natural language point of view, we're looking at, you know, conversational interfaces,

13:09.200 --> 13:15.680
building it, looking at the variety of technology solutions that could satisfy this need and how

13:15.680 --> 13:21.280
that could be integrated into the vehicle ecosystem. I think that's kind of in a couple of

13:21.280 --> 13:28.880
statements summarized, you know, all the activities we do. And, you know, also, you know, just working

13:28.880 --> 13:34.880
with, you know, variety of players in this area and see, you know, what can be bought off the shelf,

13:34.880 --> 13:40.240
what can be integrated as a service. And those are also some of the things we are looking at.

13:40.960 --> 13:48.240
From AI or ML perspective, it's essentially building this conversational interface and scaling it up

13:48.240 --> 13:54.320
for millions of users, you know, whether through vehicles or through the chatbots for customer

13:54.320 --> 14:01.280
service are also some of the things we are looking at. And what's your assessment of kind of the

14:02.000 --> 14:10.400
landscape that you're seeing to date and kind of the readiness to support the vehicle use case?

14:10.400 --> 14:17.040
Like are there, for example, in vehicles connectivity can be intermittent, but you still have,

14:17.040 --> 14:22.320
you know, you potentially have people depending on these capabilities. Like are those some of the

14:22.320 --> 14:27.920
challenges that you're facing and do you see the technology as being kind of evolved enough

14:27.920 --> 14:35.600
to support those? Yes, connectivity is a good question. So connectivity is one aspect that

14:35.600 --> 14:44.160
differentiates in a vehicle experience. So anything critical, you know, like we have services that

14:44.160 --> 14:49.600
can, you know, inform a call center operator on an event of a crash, right? So even those services

14:49.600 --> 14:57.120
currently rely on your 4G connectivity or wireless connectivity to operate. So,

14:58.400 --> 15:04.000
but those services can operate with limited data connectivity. They're sending small amounts of

15:04.000 --> 15:08.640
data, but when it comes to a voice experience, you're looking at, you know, streaming audio. So

15:08.640 --> 15:14.560
there's definitely a challenge, but I believe it's been improving a lot in terms of coverage and

15:14.560 --> 15:20.400
speeds. 4G is much more prevalent than, you know, just a few years ago. And it's going to be just

15:20.400 --> 15:26.480
upgraded to faster speeds, wider coverage. So we need to still design for it. We need to still

15:26.480 --> 15:34.720
design for connectivity issues, but I think given the nature of some of these services, most of them

15:34.720 --> 15:42.640
are non-critical. You know, we turn them as infotainment service. So that should be something we can

15:42.640 --> 15:50.640
take care of. The main aspect we are looking at is, you know, a conversational voice interface

15:50.640 --> 15:54.880
in a vehicle is much different, could be much different than, you know, what you have at home

15:54.880 --> 16:01.840
or a smartphone. I believe that's where, you know, the product design has to evolve to capture

16:01.840 --> 16:08.080
that user experience and have the technology be able to support it, right? So simple examples

16:08.080 --> 16:16.640
could be in your vehicle when you're asking for something, if the vehicle keeps asking for

16:16.640 --> 16:22.720
confirmation, that could be very distracting, right? So there are certain things we need to work

16:22.720 --> 16:28.880
around or change in the way the users work with the vehicle and also make it multimodal, right?

16:28.880 --> 16:35.520
Because we have a heads up display, we have the dashboard, we have the multimedia unit as well.

16:35.520 --> 16:42.320
So how can the visual and the auditory output combine and work together to make this user experience

16:42.320 --> 16:48.400
better? So when you combine these, then even the technology has to adapt to these different

16:48.960 --> 16:53.360
multimodal inputs in a way. So those are, you know, essentially some of the challenges.

16:54.080 --> 16:59.600
Has Toyota announced specific, like a specific set of partners around this voice assistant

16:59.600 --> 17:07.600
market or if not, you know, what's your general take on kind of the timeline for seeing that

17:07.600 --> 17:15.360
technology in vehicles? We had already announced a partnership with Amazon and the CES.

17:16.160 --> 17:22.320
So some form of Alexa experience is going to be brought into the vehicle for the immediate term.

17:22.320 --> 17:30.080
I think for a more deeper integrated experience, it's going to take a few years.

17:30.080 --> 17:34.880
You know, I can't give a specific timeline now. It's still looking into, you know, various aspects.

17:34.880 --> 17:41.920
But I think the future where we are looking at a variety of vehicle inputs and integrating

17:41.920 --> 17:46.480
into this experience is at least two or three years away for Toyota.

17:46.480 --> 17:54.640
Not to say that we won't have an experience before that. It's just that there are various levels

17:54.640 --> 17:59.760
to it, right? So when I talk about facial recognition and emotions and seeing, I think those are

17:59.760 --> 18:04.240
definitely, you know, three to four years away. There's cost involved in having even a camera

18:04.240 --> 18:11.920
to recognize your facial expression. So some of those, it would depend on whether it's a luxury

18:11.920 --> 18:20.000
vehicle versus an economy vehicle. So those would also impact the timelines. In terms of partners

18:20.000 --> 18:25.360
other than Alexa, I think we are working with, you know, different other players, not to name names,

18:25.360 --> 18:31.440
but, you know, hopefully we'll soon, you know, announce those partnerships in the next few months.

18:31.440 --> 18:39.600
Were you at CES this year? Yes, I was. Okay, I was there also. So maybe I see this question.

18:39.600 --> 18:45.120
I've been kind of waiting for someone, a good person to ask this question. So you guys announced

18:45.120 --> 18:51.920
this partnership with Alexa. And in fact, at, you know, CES, basically everyone was kind of

18:51.920 --> 18:59.280
announcing these partnerships with Alexa and Google Assistant. And like, I feel like this is really

18:59.280 --> 19:09.280
consumer driven or is this kind of the, you know, this ecosystem getting way out ahead of what

19:09.280 --> 19:16.160
consumers want. Like, I don't, I've got Alexa's around here and Google Assistant's around here.

19:16.160 --> 19:21.840
And, you know, they're basically, I say this all the time. Like, I think the technology is amazing.

19:22.800 --> 19:28.080
And that over time, it will evolve to be, you know, extremely useful. And I think that

19:29.280 --> 19:35.120
targeted voice interfaces definitely have a place. But right now, you know, I think of them as

19:35.120 --> 19:40.480
like expensive timers and alarm clocks, right? So most expensive egg timer I have ever bought.

19:42.240 --> 19:49.440
And I'm just not sure that it's the consumer that is driving these things into refrigerators

19:49.440 --> 19:58.640
and washing machines and cars and ironing boards and like garage doors, everything. What do you

19:58.640 --> 20:05.520
think? So I may have a different take on this. My personal opinion, not, you know, of course, not

20:05.520 --> 20:11.200
to it as, but, you know, I got the Alexa when it first came out of the market pre-ordered, same

20:11.200 --> 20:17.200
did with the Google Assistant and been using it. And, you know, my wife's opinion was the same

20:17.200 --> 20:22.080
as yours. You know, why do we buy this expensive timer? I know this just, you know, and do two things.

20:22.080 --> 20:27.600
But I think it has evolved over a period of time. You know, you started asking for weather and you

20:27.600 --> 20:33.200
started playing music. Now, you know, we can't live without it for playing music, right? So

20:34.000 --> 20:39.600
just come home, you know, and then say a command and you have a nice little background music going.

20:39.600 --> 20:45.360
So I think the utility, even though it is limited, it's expanding. And once you know, and this is where

20:45.360 --> 20:53.280
we, you know, there is an adaptation from the human side to say, this is how I use the technology

20:53.280 --> 21:01.360
to get the best use, right? So you know exactly what to ask. So my daughter knows exactly what to ask.

21:02.560 --> 21:07.440
And she knows if you ask it in a different way, it's not going to be useful. So I think when

21:07.440 --> 21:12.480
when humans start learning how to use this technology for one thing at a time, maybe you're using

21:12.480 --> 21:17.520
it just for timer today, tomorrow, you may use it for weather. So over a period of time, you start

21:17.520 --> 21:23.760
using it for minor things. I think, and then six months down the line, I take away all the Alexa's

21:23.760 --> 21:30.320
and Google homes from your home. You're going to be very frustrated, believe me. So I think there is

21:30.320 --> 21:37.360
utility. It's limited, but it expands and humans start to learn and adapt on how to use it for

21:37.360 --> 21:43.360
specific use cases at specific times. So there is definitely customer demand and you could look at

21:43.360 --> 21:50.480
the sale of these, these units over the last holiday period. So and take that into the car,

21:50.480 --> 21:56.160
it's, you know, whether it's customer demand or not, you need a really good conversational

21:56.160 --> 22:00.240
interface in the car. There's no better place than car for these kind of interfaces, right?

22:00.240 --> 22:05.440
Yeah. So there is part customer demand, but there's also part and need for this to have in the

22:05.440 --> 22:13.840
vehicle, you know, 10 years ago, and you know, at least now we are starting to have these in the car.

22:13.840 --> 22:20.000
So I feel, I feel it's, it's well-deserved attention given to these technologies to be brought

22:20.000 --> 22:28.720
into the car better late than never. So I do, I agree that the car is one of the places where,

22:28.720 --> 22:36.960
you know, particularly when you've, you've got the integrations that you've described, all set up

22:36.960 --> 22:42.720
and figured out, you know, there's a lot of value there because, you know, until the car is driving

22:42.720 --> 22:49.920
itself, like it'd be better for me to keep my eyes on the wheel than to, you know, dial a phone

22:49.920 --> 22:59.520
or change the temperature or whatever. So that said, like when you think about an Alexa, what's the role

23:00.320 --> 23:09.440
of Alexa? Is Alexa a service at the front end that's doing kind of the speech recognition and,

23:09.440 --> 23:16.240
you know, is it a platform that's figuring out intense and all that kind of stuff or does Toyota

23:16.240 --> 23:21.920
develop technology, you know, or need to develop technology that does all that because that's where

23:21.920 --> 23:29.200
the integration needs to happen. And then Alexa is this back end kind of portal to a bunch of other

23:29.200 --> 23:35.600
consumer services. That's again, going to the heart of the problem on, you know, what we are dealing

23:35.600 --> 23:44.560
with. So you seem to have been involved in this for quite a time. So, but yeah, that's a very good

23:44.560 --> 23:52.960
question. Multiple people have multiple opinions on this. My personal opinion is we need to have these

23:52.960 --> 24:00.640
technologies as a base, you know, whether we build it or whether we get partners to do it, I think

24:00.640 --> 24:08.400
these technologies are going to be used in various different interfaces, right? So even things like

24:08.400 --> 24:14.960
chatbots for customer service, you know, today we have thousands of calls coming into our call center

24:14.960 --> 24:20.320
asking about how to use a particular vehicle system or how to use a particular setting in their

24:20.320 --> 24:25.920
navigation to do what they want to do. And, you know, we could we could reduce a lot of these

24:25.920 --> 24:31.600
customer calls with, let's say, a simple chatbot available through their messenger app or whatever.

24:31.600 --> 24:36.400
And then if you're able to do it really well, it's going to be much easier for the customer

24:36.400 --> 24:42.320
rather than picking up the phone to get answers. So I think the technology as a base is going to

24:42.320 --> 24:49.600
serve multiple endpoints. So we need to approach it from that perspective. And then your in-vehicle

24:49.600 --> 24:55.280
is just another or more, you know, it's most important, but it's another interface for the customer.

24:55.280 --> 25:00.880
So if you look at it from that perspective, it's definitely, you know, imperative for us to have

25:00.880 --> 25:07.200
the technology to do this. And, you know, all these different ecosystems from from these

25:07.200 --> 25:13.680
assistant providers bring all the integrations that they already have to add on to this experience.

25:13.680 --> 25:21.440
I'm curious about maybe there's more like culture, you know, auto manufacturer culture meets AI

25:21.440 --> 25:28.240
and like how that all works and are there, you know, things that you're seeing where, you know,

25:28.240 --> 25:34.000
ways in which the organization is changing to adapt to kind of this new way of thinking about

25:34.000 --> 25:39.680
interfaces or things like that or things that you think personally need to happen for large kind

25:39.680 --> 25:45.440
of engineering culture, traditional engineering culture driven organizations like auto manufacturers

25:45.440 --> 25:53.840
to adopt this technology. Yes. And that's a good segue. So I can talk about data connected.

25:53.840 --> 26:00.880
So that's the reason Toyota connected was set up. So Toyota itself is a huge conglomerate

26:00.880 --> 26:07.840
that everybody knows. Toyota connected is set up as a technology company to build this innovation

26:07.840 --> 26:14.240
from within, right? So typically the service providers or, you know, companies that specialize in

26:14.240 --> 26:19.760
product development, whether it could be AI, ML or, you know, natural language or anything else

26:19.760 --> 26:26.320
for that matter. Now they are out, they're not the automotive company itself, right? So as an

26:26.320 --> 26:31.520
automotive company, we know how customers, you know, we know what customers want, we know how

26:31.520 --> 26:38.640
customers behave, we know how our vehicles behave. So just fusing these two, you know, the technology

26:38.640 --> 26:46.880
and innovation capabilities with this domain experience is really a key area for us to move forward.

26:46.880 --> 26:53.200
Right? So everybody has to become a technology company in order to survive in this new way of

26:53.200 --> 27:00.640
thing. So, so that's that's the primary purpose. Toyota, you know, connected was set up. So with

27:00.640 --> 27:07.440
the, you know, our management encourages innovation. It's an open culture startup atmosphere, except

27:07.440 --> 27:14.640
with a nice backing of the huge Toyota name. And that's essentially brought into, you know,

27:14.640 --> 27:21.920
attract talent who can, who can build this from within and make sure it gels with the customer

27:21.920 --> 27:28.160
needs, right? So it's, it's like fusing this hardware and software together built by the same

27:28.160 --> 27:33.600
same player has its own advantages. So that's, that's, that's what we're looking at,

27:34.800 --> 27:40.720
to doing, at doing in Toyota connected. And I hope that answers your question is probably

27:40.720 --> 27:47.040
if we're asking whether it's needed or not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It sounds like it is. And it's,

27:47.040 --> 27:53.520
that's kind of the way you're addressing it. And so what other, are there other ways that,

27:53.520 --> 28:00.400
or areas that Toyota connected is looking at AI beyond, well, you mentioned, we talked extensively

28:00.400 --> 28:04.960
about the voice interface. You mentioned chatbots as a customer service experience. So there are

28:04.960 --> 28:13.600
other ways that Toyota connected is looking at AI. Yes. Toyota connected has built a connected,

28:13.600 --> 28:18.720
you know, it's a car sharing platform. And you've probably heard about it in CES when, when our

28:18.720 --> 28:25.120
president talked about E palette and some of those services that come with the car sharing

28:25.120 --> 28:31.760
economy. And in fact, we had launched a pilot in, in Hawaii as well for car sharing. So that

28:31.760 --> 28:38.240
is going to, you know, give us some opportunity to optimize the sharing economy in terms of,

28:38.240 --> 28:44.640
you know, what are the best places in the town to keep cars so people can make it lies, you know.

28:44.640 --> 28:51.600
So there's, there's a demand forecasting, you know, heat map. Can we change the pricing based

28:51.600 --> 28:56.240
on the demand so we can get better utilization of the car? So there's a lot of things that you can do

28:56.240 --> 29:03.120
with with ML in the in the car in the car sharing economy. There's also things around, you know,

29:03.120 --> 29:09.040
preferences driver preferences, customer preferences to, you know, surface notifications.

29:10.880 --> 29:16.320
And then like I said earlier, probably, you know, areas like coaching, you know, something we

29:16.320 --> 29:21.440
have started working into using machine learning. So yes, there are plenty of other areas that we have

29:21.440 --> 29:27.920
started investigation on how we can best leverage AI and ML. Awesome. Well, GK, thank you so much
