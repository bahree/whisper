00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,920
people doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,520
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,640
This week on the podcast features a series of conversations with speakers from the AI Summit

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,920
in New York City.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,200
The theme of that conference and this series is AI in the Enterprise and I think you'll

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,240
find a really interesting mix of both technical and case study oriented discussions this week.

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,360
Please note that on Wednesday December 13th we'll be holding our last Twimble online

9
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,360
meet-up of the year.

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,520
Bring your thoughts on the top machine learning and AI stories of 2017 for our discussion

11
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,620
segment and for our main presentation Bruno GonzÃ¡lez will be discussing the paper, understand

12
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,220
and deep learning requires rethinking generalization by Shi Yuan Zhang from MIT and Google Brain and

13
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,300
others.

14
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:11,340

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,180
To close out our AI Summit New York series I speak with Sharif Mietius, head of technology,

16
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,940
digital and strategy at restaurant chain TGI Fridays.

17
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:28,340
Sharif joins us to discuss how Fridays is utilizing conversational AI to enhance customer

18
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:30,180
loyalty.

19
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,620
Sharif wants Fridays to be known as a tech company that happens to sell burgers and beer

20
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:38,980
and in this conversation we get an in-depth look at the technology landscape they've

21
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,260
put in place to move the company in that direction.

22
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,300
Sharif also shares some of the things on the horizon for Fridays as well as some of

23
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,380
what they've learned along the way.

24
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,900

35
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,500
And now on to the show.

36
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:55,700
Alright everyone, I am on the line with Sharif Mityas.

37
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,820
Sharif is CIO and Vice President of Strategy with TDI Fridays.

38
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,060
Sharif, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

39
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,060
Thank you.

40
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,060
Pleasure to be here.

41
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,060
Absolutely.

42
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,340
Why don't we get started by having you tell us a little bit about your background and

43
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:13,740
how you came to get involved in AI?

44
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,980
Yeah, well it's been a securitus route.

45
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:24,460
I started my career actually in consulting, worked with a number of Fortune 500 retailers,

46
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:32,740
restaurant brands, consumer products organizations, and really through my career helping organizations

47
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:39,780
think about kind of really innovation, talking about how do we create, how do we evolve and

48
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,740
really drive innovation from an organizational perspective to allow us to better meet really

49
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:51,420
the end-state goals, whether that is drive revenue, reduce cost, greater guest engagement,

50
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:57,340
and really as the underpinnings of that throughout my career has been technology.

51
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:02,620
Technology enables us to do different things, to do things that allows us to look at things

52
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,860
differently really at scale.

53
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:11,220
And for very large organizations being able to do things at an individual or customer level

54
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,780
is really enabled by technology, you'll never have enough bodies, so to speak, to be able

55
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:22,220
to target individual guests without the use of technology and so as my career continued

56
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,380
to evolve, continued to rely and really utilize technology to drive innovation.

57
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:34,620
And now in my current role, really driving kind of the question of what's next for restaurants,

58
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:40,740
what's next for engaging guests both inside our four walls as well as outside and really

59
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:51,460
utilizing the power now of AI and chatbots and the new technologies to create a different

60
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:57,220
level of guest engagement, to really create more intimacy and that one-to-one connection

61
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,700
that every brand strives to have.

62
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,300
We go back to the first TGI Fridays over 50 years ago, was that first bar and grill

63
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:12,460
in New York where the bartender connected one-on-one with that guest and coming back now 50

64
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:19,460
plus years later when we serve over 500,000 guests per day across our network globally, how

65
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:24,740
do we go back to connecting with those individuals on a one-to-one basis?

66
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,660
AI allows us to do that.

67
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:33,300
Can you elaborate on how if you think about it at face value, maybe you think about it

68
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,140
in the opposite way, right, that AI kind of gets in between human-to-human connections?

69
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:41,060
How are you saying how are you looking at it?

70
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,300
Yeah, so we're looking at really in two ways.

71
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,740
I mean, the old adage of, you know, help me be better and don't hinder, right?

72
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,300
So from a do-no-harm is kind of the physicians adage.

73
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,580
And so when we think about AI and really specifically technology, it's how does it make

74
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,580
our people better?

75
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,540
How does it make our team members in the restaurants better?

76
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:08,220
How does it make us better from a corporate perspective and in really in two ways?

77
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:14,780
So, you know, from a, when our guests are outside our restaurants, they're on social platforms,

78
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:20,060
they're talking to voices, sister devices, they're doing things on a daily basis, whether

79
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,940
mobility or, you know, sitting behind a desk, that drives engagement, that they want to

80
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,940
be engaged, right?

81
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,620
They want to talk to their friends, they want to understand what's happening, they want

82
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,620
to share things.

83
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:37,700
And we use AI to be part of that conversation.

84
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,860
So through our chatbots, for example, we use AI to listen.

85
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,180
We understand when people are talking about certain drinks.

86
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:49,740
We understand when it's a hot day in New York and they're talking about long island ice

87
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,060
teas.

88
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:57,900
And so we use AI to capture first information and then to suggest the next best action,

89
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,900
right?

90
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:02,340
So for that individual guest who's thinking about that old adage, you know, kind of, what

91
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,340
do I do tonight?

92
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,980
You know, what are we, what are we going to do tonight?

93
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,380
Where are we going to go?

94
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:13,180
Being part of their daily kind of interaction with their friends on the social platforms,

95
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:19,900
utilizing AI to come up with that, well, send this individual, this specific content at

96
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,660
this specific time on this specific platform is really powerful.

97
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:30,940
So being able to connect with individuals using technology allows the people that our

98
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:36,780
social media team, for example, to have higher level conversations, they know more about

99
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,780
these guests.

100
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:42,700
They're using AI to be smarter in how they respond in certain cases.

101
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:48,660
So we have the bots respond, but we also have humans still respond and it makes them better.

102
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:52,700
Similarly inside our restaurants, we have loyalty members, for example.

103
00:07:52,700 --> 00:08:01,900
And so if I can tell the host or hostess through AI that a loyalty member is in the bar,

104
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,820
and this is what they've had before, this is their favorite drink, this is how they like

105
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,700
to engage.

106
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:13,580
Imagine how much more powerful that information is for a bartender or a host or a server

107
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,260
knowing who that individual guest is and we make them better.

108
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,140
We create a better experience for the guest because we know who you are and we provide

109
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:27,460
that information through the technology to our servers inside the restaurant.

110
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,500
In that latter scenario, where does AI come in relative to traditional loyalty types

111
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,980
of technology is like a CRM system?

112
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:43,580
Yeah, so what we do is the data, the CRM, the guest profile information, it sits behind

113
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:50,900
the scenes, but AI then says, okay, I know not only who this person is, but given what

114
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:58,340
others have done, what other actions people have taken, I suggest you offer X. I suggest

115
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:05,980
that we surprise and delight this guest because we can show a return on offering whatever

116
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:13,140
it is that second drink we can offer something suggestive that we feed to our servers or bartenders

117
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,820
to be able to kind of again deliver the next best action as it relates to our guest.

118
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,700
So it's beyond predictive, it's really around what are some of the different options that

119
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:29,940
the machine is telling us should work to help either drive loyalty, increase frequency

120
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,460
or drive the check average higher.

121
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:39,220
So your initial efforts in this space have been focused on chatbots both outside the

122
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:47,660
store and in the store, taking a step back, how did you think about the space of AI and

123
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:53,380
the opportunity presented by AI as a whole and determine where to start?

124
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,700
Yeah, that's a great question.

125
00:09:54,700 --> 00:10:01,540
So we kind of started, and again, I'll profess, we are still in the crawl of the crawl walk

126
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,540
run.

127
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,540
I think we all are.

128
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,540
Yeah.

129
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,580
And this sector is, this technology is really, I think we're just starting to scratch

130
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,580
the service.

131
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,580
So when we step back, we obviously did the first thing, which is we just talked to a lot

132
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,140
of people, you know, the old, you know, I'm a big proponent of, don't be the smartest

133
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,380
person in the room.

134
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,260
And so we reached out to a lot of folks, we reached out to a lot of different third parties

135
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:26,660
and partners and just started understanding, understanding what are the use cases out

136
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,660
there?

137
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,660
Right?

138
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,460
What are what are other people at least exploring?

139
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,340
Whether that be, and we heard a lot about customer service, right?

140
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,140
So we talked a lot of folks that were using AI in their, in their help desks and their,

141
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,340
you know, customer service, you know, call centers.

142
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,340
And that was interesting.

143
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,380
And we obviously have our own call center and people call 1-800 Fridays.

144
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,900
So we felt that was, you know, interesting, but too far removed, right?

145
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,940
We were, we were wanting to use AI more around that first interaction or that kind of very

146
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:03,460
user kind of guest facing activity that, again, is understanding how they think about considering

147
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,660
where they're going to go tonight for a food or a beverage occasion.

148
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,820
So instead of kind of what I would consider kind of the, the back end when, when someone

149
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,300
wants to call you and ask a question, I wanted to get out in front of it.

150
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:21,860
And be more kind of using AI to really understand the voice of the customer and to be able to

151
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,900
respond with more relevant and more personalized content.

152
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,740
So that's what really started the path on.

153
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,740
So how do we do that?

154
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:35,580
And so we started from a guest first perspective that said, well, where are our guests when

155
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,580
they're not with us, where, where are they and what are they doing?

156
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:42,460
Obviously, they're on social, obviously, they're talking to things, they're, they're typing

157
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,460
things.

158
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:48,620
We started our journey by understanding where they are and then start, and then ask questions

159
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:51,580
on what do we want AI to solve, right?

160
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:57,940
So we went back to some of the KPIs and said, well, from a, from a metrics perspective,

161
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,420
we're after, you know, loyalty, we want, we want loyal guests.

162
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,500
We want them to come in more often, right?

163
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:09,820
So from a frequency perspective, and we want them to spend more when they're with us,

164
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:15,420
whether they're dining inside a restaurant or picking up an order to go or delivered.

165
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,580
And so if you start with those questions, then you, then you kind of work backwards and

166
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,900
say, well, how can AI help that?

167
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,060
Well, first we need to understand, right?

168
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:28,100
So to me, the first thing that AI really before we got into God into AI is we had to, we

169
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:31,060
had to, we had to listen, we had to collect data.

170
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,740
And that led us to chatbots, right?

171
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:38,620
Because chatbots are not only just delivery mechanisms, they're listening mechanisms as well.

172
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,460
They help you understand what people are talking about, what questions, what dialogues they're

173
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,140
having as it relates to the brand.

174
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,100
Then we had to connect the dots.

175
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,580
So then we used some other third parties to say, okay, I've got purchase behavior.

176
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,580
I know what people buy.

177
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,820
I know when they buy it.

178
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,940
I know I know where they are when they buy it.

179
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,260
And then I have all these interactions that are happening on social platforms and voice

180
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,740
enabled devices.

181
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,620
I also have kind of information when they call or one 800 Fridays call centers.

182
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,580
I know credit card data, I know four square data, I know all this data.

183
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,940
But now I need someone, I need something to stitch it together and help me understand

184
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,540
what to do with it, right?

185
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,420
Kind of what, what do I do with this?

186
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:26,100
How do I pull the insights and create that next best action for my guest?

187
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,140
And that's kind of the path we took.

188
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:34,340
I imagine a big part of the challenge in approaching these various AI projects has been

189
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,860
in that latter piece that you made sounds so easy with connecting the dots, right?

190
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:44,460
Can you elaborate on some of what went into making all that happen?

191
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,460
Yeah.

192
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,420
So again, it goes back to not being the smartest people in the room.

193
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,940
We partnered with kind of a very early stage startup out of Seattle that really helped

194
00:13:55,940 --> 00:14:01,820
us pull all this structured and unstructured data together and started creating not just

195
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:08,020
micro segments, but really the opportunity to differentiate, you know, Sally versus Mary.

196
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:13,260
And we ran a bunch of pilots, as you can imagine, to, you know, really start holding in

197
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,580
on, well, do we really know Sally?

198
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,380
And then I know someone that looks like Sally, but she's slightly different.

199
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,220
So I don't know her name yet.

200
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:26,780
So let's call her Sally B and Sally C. And so we started kind of really, again, creating

201
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:34,700
many personas of individual guests and this, this, this tool really helps us, again, literally

202
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:39,500
I use the vernacular and they use it before I even met them, connect the dots.

203
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,780
Because they're, everyone swims in data.

204
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,340
It's this opportunity to really pull it together and say, this is Sally and Sally need something

205
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:51,220
different than Mary, even though they'd be in that same demographic, psychographic, geographic

206
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,220
bucket.

207
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,380
They are two totally different individuals.

208
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,940
And our first pilot was crazy.

209
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:03,100
I mean, we, we did this where we just took a group of people that we had identified their

210
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,220
individual personas was about 10,000 people.

211
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,940
How are those 10,000 selected?

212
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:12,100
We basically just because we, we, we believed we knew a lot about them through this, this

213
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,260
data stitching activity.

214
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,900
They weren't loyalty members, right?

215
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,900
So we didn't, we didn't have them already in our database.

216
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:25,060
These were just individual guests that we had been able to pull from there, again,

217
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,660
gastrointactivity, their online activity, their social activity, et cetera.

218
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,380
And we sent them a message.

219
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,020
We sent them a message on whatever platform they happened to be on if they had given

220
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,020
us permission.

221
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:42,260
So they had obviously interacted with us somehow in the past, but they weren't loyalty members.

222
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,660
We sent them a message, non, a non-discount message that was just relevant to them.

223
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:55,940
So for instance, Mary, we knew, liked for whatever reason, she drank wine on Tuesday nights.

224
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,060
And she always had a girl's night on Tuesday nights.

225
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,500
So we figured it might be some book club, might be something that was encouraging Mary to

226
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,460
have wine on Tuesday nights.

227
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,460
Okay.

228
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:11,020
So we sent a message to Mary about a wine special just for her on Tuesday night at her local

229
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,020
Fridays.

230
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:17,340
And you said that's not, it wasn't discount, it wasn't a discounted promotion.

231
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:18,900
It was some other kind of special.

232
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,940
It was just a special like we have this new wine at our restaurant.

233
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,300
We'd like you to come try it.

234
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,660
And we sent it to her Tuesday at 5 p.m., right?

235
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:34,020
So right before we knew she was about to go out, well, each person of this 10,000 had

236
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,100
a different message like that.

237
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:40,660
We had a 78% click-through rate.

238
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:47,860
And then out of that 78%, we tracked half of that group actually ordered something that

239
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:51,420
we could tell, because we knew that we were able to track them.

240
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,420
Some people we couldn't track.

241
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:56,180
So they may have ordered, but they used cash or something we didn't know.

242
00:16:56,180 --> 00:17:01,260
Without a discount, we drove purchase of one third of that group.

243
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:08,740
And so it was the power again of a very personalized message at the right time that was powered

244
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:12,580
basically by this AI tool that we had partnered with.

245
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,020
And what was that company?

246
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:15,500
They're called Imperity.

247
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Imperity?

248
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
Yep.

249
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,500
And is that something where, is that like a cloud service of some sort, or is it software

250
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,420
that you're running or more service that they delivered?

251
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,820
It's a service they deliver.

252
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,820
Okay.

253
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,820
Interesting.

254
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,820
Interesting.

255
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:36,660
And so you've kind of collected all this, well, you actually did you find in going

256
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:44,180
through the process that there was some data that you needed that you didn't have?

257
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,180
There's always data.

258
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:49,180
There's always, you're always like to have more in this business, obviously.

259
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:56,700
And I think it really comes down to the ability to really connect with folks that piece of

260
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:02,220
information that says, I want to go beyond email and in-app messages, right?

261
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:07,820
It's the ability to figure out specifically, you know, I'm tied to you here.

262
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:15,420
You're talking to my bot on Facebook or on Twitter, you know, understanding exactly how

263
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:20,860
I can, I can provide a message on various devices at the right time because we're still

264
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:26,140
a little hindered by you have to approve every kind of communication channel.

265
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:31,460
More information there and more ability to connect with you beyond just email and in-app

266
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,460
would be obviously be powerful.

267
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,380
The other piece that we're trying to get into is friends of people that we know, right?

268
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:43,180
So going back to Mary, I know Mary went out for Tuesday, wine.

269
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:46,980
I don't know enough yet about Mary's friends, right?

270
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:54,580
And the group that we also are trying to target, as you can imagine, are very friend driven

271
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,380
from a recommendation engine perspective, right?

272
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,500
So when a group of friends, someone always asks, well, where are we going tonight?

273
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
They take the input of their friends, right?

274
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:09,820
So if I can get one of those friends to suggest Fridays, first, I got to win, right?

275
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:15,580
And so we're really working hard now to understand, okay, how do I get into the networks of these

276
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:23,260
people that I know to create more engagement, to create more recommendation opportunities,

277
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:28,300
to be able to extend, basically, our reach of those that we really know into those that

278
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,220
we would like to know and help us recommend.

279
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,620
And what does that mean for you to explore something like that?

280
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:40,980
Do you have some set of folks that are kind of dedicated to R&D or you doing, you have

281
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,980
kind of an evolving proof of concept or some effort that you're working on to try to

282
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,860
explore these avenues, or is it more keeping your eyes open and ears to the ground and

283
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,460
seeing what other folks are doing?

284
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,460
Yeah.

285
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,980
So right now, we have a couple of people that, again, I kind of dedicate to the, what's

286
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:00,180
next category?

287
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:06,020
They're always kind of searching, talking to, you know, new startups, third parties to understand,

288
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:08,460
what's emerging, what's possible.

289
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,620
And so they are kind of my, you know, my seekers, so to speak, in terms of going out and

290
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,740
trying to understand what can we leverage, what's new and innovative.

291
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:22,580
In this case, in that specific example, I gave, we have early conversations going in terms

292
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:23,780
of how to make that happen.

293
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,180
We don't have a pilot rolling out yet, but to me, it's the next piece we need to push

294
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,180
through.

295
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,220
In terms of the, get it down the, I forget what was the name of the company that you

296
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,220
mentioned?

297
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
Amparity.

298
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,380
Amparity.

299
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:42,940
And I guess I'm curious about the various technology pieces and platforms that were used

300
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,660
to pull all this together.

301
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:50,620
So Amparity, it sounds like they had a big part in the connecting the dots pieces, you

302
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,980
know, pulling information from, I'm assuming, various silos that you've got your CRMs,

303
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:03,140
your transactional systems, et cetera, and making that available via some fashion.

304
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:06,140
But then there are pieces like the chat platform itself.

305
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:10,740
Did you use an off-the-shelf platform, or did you build one yourself?

306
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:20,980
Some of the AI or analytics pieces that you describe for determining the next best offer,

307
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,820
you know, is that stuff that you built yourself or stuff that you used off the shelf?

308
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,300
Can you talk a little bit about the technology landscape that enables all this?

309
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,300
Sure.

310
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:35,380
So, the underlying, what I'll call data warehouse areas is powered by Microsoft.

311
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,700
We're obviously all in the cloud with Azure.

312
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:43,340
We have, you know, the data lakes that house all the information for us, kind of feeding

313
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,340
that.

314
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:50,380
Obviously, we have all our tier-point transactional data, whether that be from our restaurants

315
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:56,100
that's driven by, from a front-of-house perspective, micros, back-of-house, NCR.

316
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:01,860
We have the online platform that drives data into that, which is powered by Adobe and

317
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,980
our hybrid platform from SAP.

318
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,780
So those are kind of the big pieces of data, you know, moving on to the new technologies

319
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:14,100
like our chatbots and the AI that powers those.

320
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:20,100
We partnered with a great firm out of Austin called Conversable and Conversable Powers.

321
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:26,060
All of that for us, whether it be on Facebook, Twitter, Amazon Alexa, and we just launched

322
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:32,460
with GM's on-star platform, so we're in millions of on-star vehicles now.

323
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,260
Do people actually use that?

324
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,260
They do.

325
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,260
Believe it or not.

326
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,260
Yes.

327
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,340
And, you know, we've just started with them.

328
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:43,860
So we don't have the ordering turned on, but we have the, you can make a reservation for

329
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,340
a table like on your way in the car, you're looking for a restaurant, it obviously gives you

330
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,580
directions to the local Fridays.

331
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,500
Pretty soon we'll have the capability to, you know, have your first drink waiting for

332
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
you at the table on your way.

333
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:01,180
So yeah, I mean, we got a lot of fun things planned, again, engaging, we're a fun and social

334
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,180
brand.

335
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,180
Yeah, yeah.

336
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,180
But Conversable helps power all that.

337
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:11,380
They also have the AI engine behind that that allows us to, again, create the machine creates

338
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:18,060
new content personalized to the conversation that's occurring across the different platforms.

339
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:23,300
That all, again, feeds into, it's kind of a loop into impurity that helps us understand

340
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:29,260
these personas, connects the dots, feeds that back into things like conversable so that

341
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,500
the machine learns and can be better at targeting what they say to Mary versus Sally.

342
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,340
So that's really the core engines of our technology.

343
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:44,700
With regards to the work that Conversable did and or rather the work that you did around

344
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:52,220
the chatbot, like how much of the process of getting that up and running did the vendor

345
00:23:52,220 --> 00:24:00,660
do versus your team do and where kind of where the interfaces and the leverage points and

346
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:03,420
things like that, that question makes any sense.

347
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,420
Yeah, sure.

348
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,420
No.

349
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:10,140
You know, again, we relied, you know, in that example on Conversable, a great deal to really

350
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:16,100
help from a technical perspective and from an integration perspective, obviously working

351
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:22,420
with the Facebook and Twitter's and Amazon's of the world, GM of the world to do all the

352
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:28,860
integration pieces to really set up, again, kind of the wireframe, so to speak, the building

353
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,940
blocks of what we need to have.

354
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:37,380
So my team was more around helping what I would call tailor the experience, you know,

355
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:42,060
and making sure that it's, you know, it's in a Friday's voice, right, and making sure

356
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:47,220
that it's connecting in the right way so that, you know, A, the bots are not inappropriate,

357
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,460
they're doing the right things, right?

358
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:55,740
So the, I would say the walls, the house, you know, is built by Conversable, I would

359
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,780
say, you know, my team is more around putting the paint on the walls and the artwork on

360
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:05,860
the walls to make sure it's ours versus some generic bot.

361
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:11,180
So the, the bots, you know, there's this whole integration piece that talks to all of

362
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:18,860
the various platforms and then there's the natural language, just understanding natural

363
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:25,540
language, processing stuff that, you know, typically is like understanding the intense,

364
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:30,420
the intent of the person that you're talking to and like, what are the various, you know,

365
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,460
entities and things like that that people might be talking about and all of that kind

366
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:41,940
of stuff is that all things that your team had to come up to speed on or is that stuff

367
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,940
that you relied on the vendor to handle for you?

368
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,940
Yeah.

369
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,940
Great deal of that.

370
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,940
We, we relied on Conversable.

371
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:54,300
Obviously, as my team got more learned, I would say, we had more input.

372
00:25:54,300 --> 00:26:00,460
We started asking more questions that helped, I think, make the combined team better.

373
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,420
And I think, but yeah, clearly this was a, this was a, we kind of jumped with both feet,

374
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,180
not sure where we were landing.

375
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:11,940
We relied a great deal on our partners to get us up to speed quickly.

376
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:16,260
And then really a lot of that initial, what I'll call, trial and error.

377
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,220
We continue to refine, refine, refine as we got smarter, as we got smarter, they got smarter

378
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,460
in terms of what our guests were doing from an interaction perspective.

379
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:30,700
And really, I think the, the issue, the interesting piece was the nuance in terms of how do you

380
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,940
have to refine it by platform?

381
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,660
Just doing what we did when we launched Facebook as our first one, you couldn't just replicate

382
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,900
it onto Twitter.

383
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:44,740
It was a different conversations, different guests, different, just different vernacular

384
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,340
in certain cases that we had to employ, right?

385
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,060
Because it's a different user group in a lot of, in a lot of cases.

386
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,260
And then similarly, when we went to Amazon, right, it's a completely different, because

387
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,540
people are talking versus typing.

388
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:01,140
And so is that kind of refinement on to your point?

389
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:08,140
How do you ensure that your, your understanding, the context of the discussion is very different

390
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,140
by platform.

391
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,300
And that's really where we started to integrate and started to work together a lot more.

392
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,980
Because we could see these conversations happening even before the bot, right?

393
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,900
We were talking to people with humans.

394
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,820
And so that's where we started inputting a lot more in terms of the tone and the content

395
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,460
that that we needed to have to be Fridays in these conversations.

396
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:35,780
And so was this effort entirely driven by IT, or did you partner with a particular area

397
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,380
of the business to drive this forward?

398
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:43,940
And you know, what are kind of at least the Fridays, like what do those relationships

399
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:49,620
look like with regards to AI or the businesses kind of asking for this stuff, or are you more

400
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:55,340
out in front trying to figure it out and providing examples that will get them interested?

401
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,220
Yeah, I think initially we were out in front.

402
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,620
You know, this was something that we were pushing.

403
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:06,420
I wanted to push specifically, because I felt it helped differentiate us from our competition,

404
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,420
right?

405
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,420
We're looking for, you know, how do we be different?

406
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,940
And I don't, I don't want to compete against chilies and apple bees, because I don't

407
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,420
consider them my competition.

408
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:22,420
I consider a competition of anyone that's thinking about going for a drink or some bite of

409
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,420
food, right?

410
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:28,220
And so that's a much larger landscape, and so I'm competing against Starbucks in certain

411
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,220
cases, right?

412
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:34,660
And so I think, you know, we have to be more technologically forward and innovative in

413
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,900
the eyes of our guests.

414
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:40,420
So we pushed a lot of that initially, but I'll tell you, as soon as we started doing some

415
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:45,460
of these tests, and we started, you know, partnering and showing our friends in my counterpart

416
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,260
in marketing, you know, they came right on board.

417
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,420
They're like, now they're pushing us like, you know, faster or more, right?

418
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:56,460
Let's, I want to know Sally versus Mary, because I want to send them specific content,

419
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,460
right?

420
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:01,860
So they're pushing and we're, we have a great partner, my CMO colleague Stephanie Perdue

421
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,580
and I are connected at the hip on this and really working to figure out, again, how do

422
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,820
we continue to push the needle here, similarly on the operation side, you know, bringing

423
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:17,380
those that the benefit of AI into our operators and into the four walls, you know, our, our

424
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,780
head of operations here and I are also now like, what's next?

425
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,420
You know, can we, can we give wearables to the servers so that they're, they're getting

426
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,060
real-time information about who's walking on the door?

427
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:34,740
And so it's a lot of, again, people have started to see the power of what this can do.

428
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:39,860
And now we're, I'd say we're much more relaxed to have been in terms of how fast, how far,

429
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,460
you know, and how much.

430
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:48,660
And so how do you see the role of the IT viewer organization shifting to accommodate the

431
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,180
broader interest in these technologies?

432
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,300
Yeah, I mean, to me, our role still has to be what's next.

433
00:29:55,300 --> 00:30:02,860
For us, you know, I pride my team in pushing them to really continue to push the ball

434
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,300
forward, continue to ask the question, what's next?

435
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:09,660
What are other people even thinking about that we can be first, right?

436
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,820
So, you know, we were, we were first to use Amazon Pay on Amazon Alexa.

437
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:20,380
We're the, one of the first brands on new GM on-stars marketplace where, you know,

438
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:26,380
one of the first brands to connect one click ordering on Facebook and Twitter.

439
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:31,020
And so those types of things to me again help differentiate us, you know, I look to the

440
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,340
Starbucks and the Domino's of the world because they are truly technology companies that

441
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,460
happen to sell coffee and pizza.

442
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:43,780
I want Fridays to be recognized from a technology perspective as being technology first, technology

443
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,860
forward that happened to sell beer and ribs.

444
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,940
And then I think we get rewarded for that.

445
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,100
I think our guests appreciate that.

446
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,700
And so that to me is the role that my team has and very proud of their work and their

447
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,700
efforts because they continue to lead and drive the innovation forward.

448
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,500
Do you have a short list of things that you see as being that next, those next set of

449
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
things?

450
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,100
Yeah, I really want to do more with bringing digital inside the restaurant, right?

451
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:17,180
We, a lot of, a lot of effort by us in our counterparts is, you know, when people are

452
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:20,100
walking around outside the four walls, right?

453
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,820
All the mobile things and I, you know, are my big push for this coming year is how do

454
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:29,820
we bring those digital experiences inside the four walls, you know, whether it's an

455
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,420
interactive bar, a virtual bartender, you know, there's so many things that you can think

456
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:40,340
about bringing technology, not an obtrusive fashion, but again, to support the environment

457
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,900
that social occasion we want our guests to have with our team members and bartenders.

458
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:52,500
How does technology potentially play there and make it not only fun, but creates a unique

459
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:58,340
experience that guests say, well, that's cool and the only place I can do that is at Fridays.

460
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,660
That's what we're really pushing for next year and I think the next couple of years is

461
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:07,500
to create that more seamless integration between off premise and in restaurant as it relates

462
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:13,060
to digital and how AI and some of the other technologies can help support that.

463
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:18,780
And are there specific directions that you're playing in ahead to enable that or you kind

464
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,540
of still trying to figure all that out?

465
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:26,620
Well, I can't spill all my secrets on this, but you know, I think there's a lot of things

466
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,620
that are in the works.

467
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:32,620
We're still trying to figure some of it out, to be honest, I have the benefit of having

468
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:37,660
a test restaurant, so to speak, a little lab that we get to try fun things.

469
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,660
So, you know, we're...

470
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:40,100
Oh, that sounds like a lot of fun.

471
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,100
It's a ton of fun.

472
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:47,380
So, I've been able to try bar tops that are like iPads and being able to do things around

473
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:51,460
the TVs around our bar that bring again the guests into the experience.

474
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:56,100
So, those are just little teasers and we'll have to talk next year, so I can give you

475
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,100
more.

476
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,100
Awesome.

477
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:04,380
And then as you think to rolling all of this out, what strike you as some of the big challenges

478
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,380
that you'll face in the process?

479
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,820
Yeah, I think the biggest two big challenges.

480
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:15,940
One is to make sure we don't get too far in front of our guests or our organization.

481
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:21,180
And what I mean by that is, you know, sometimes technology, just for technology's sake, can

482
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,900
be a massive failure, right?

483
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,380
It gets too far in front, guests aren't sure what to do with it.

484
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:32,180
They don't see it as a value, our operations can't support it, so I can give good information

485
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,420
to someone, but if they don't do anything with it, it was a failed exercise, right?

486
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:41,780
And so, I think it's making sure that we continue to be in lockstep and have our guests tell

487
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:46,780
us what they're looking for, you know, in certain cases to be more convenient, frictionless,

488
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:48,940
more fun, social, et cetera.

489
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,660
And there are operators as well that tell us what they can handle and what they can, we

490
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,900
can ensure they execute on a daily basis across our 900 plus restaurants.

491
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:02,300
I think the other piece that we have to just make sure of is that again, there's a lot

492
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,980
of cool things we can do, right?

493
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:07,180
And at the end of the day, you know, cool doesn't pay the bills.

494
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:14,500
We have to make sure that everything we do is tied to an ROI, it's tied to a returnable,

495
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,860
you know, whether that be, you know, obviously revenue is the easiest thing to measure, but

496
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:23,740
even guest engagement and frequency and loyalty and, you know, if it doesn't tie back to one

497
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:28,420
of those strategic pillars, then it may be cool, but it's not going to be for us.

498
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:33,060
And so I think we have to continue to always, I would say, measure ourselves or guard ourselves

499
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:38,460
against getting too far out and then also doing things that just have PR value, but don't

500
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:42,180
really move the needle for the organization, right?

501
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,860
Anything else you'd like to leave the audience with?

502
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:48,620
Well, I think the only thing I think, you know, if people are even considering doing

503
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:53,500
this or they're starting their efforts, you know, to me, there's just a few lessons

504
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,980
learned that I would, I would impart here at the end, you know, one again is really take

505
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,900
your time, you know, there's no word for speed in this area, you know, the technology can

506
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:09,620
get overwhelming, take your time, learn it, test the heck out of it, make sure it's right

507
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:14,780
for what you want to achieve, because it can do a lot, but it can also get you in trouble

508
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,220
if you don't have some guardrails.

509
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:21,660
The second thing I'd say is, you know, going back to the earlier conversation, don't

510
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:27,460
try to do this alone, this is a wide open kind of Wild West Frontier, there are some

511
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:33,740
good emerging partners out there, my suggestion is to utilize them even if it's to have a conversation

512
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:38,740
so that you don't, you don't bloody your knees where that path's already been taken.

513
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:41,940
And finally, just always remember what you're doing it for.

514
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,100
In our case, it's for the guest and ensuring that you always kind of keep that in mind and

515
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,980
tie it back to, you know, what are the key questions that you're trying to answer and

516
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,300
is it really going to make, you know, your customer, your guest better in terms of their

517
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,820
interaction, their experience with your brand. For us, that's kind of the holy grail, if

518
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:04,020
it doesn't impact them in a positive light, in a positive way, then we don't do it.

519
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:09,220
That all sounds like excellent advice. Sounds like you've been down this road a few times.

520
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,220
Yes. A lot of bloody knees.

521
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:16,340
