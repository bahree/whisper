Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

00:16.320 --> 00:21.480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:21.480 --> 00:33.800
I'm your host Sam Charrington. In this episode of our Pegaworld series recorded on

00:33.800 --> 00:39.640
site at the conference in Las Vegas a few weeks ago, I'm joined by Michael Kemper, chief operating

00:39.640 --> 00:45.800
officer, a global share registry and financial services provider, Link Market Services.

00:45.800 --> 00:49.920
In this interview, Michael and I dig into Link's use of workforce intelligence software

00:49.920 --> 00:55.600
to allow it to track and analyze the performance of its workforce and business processes.

00:55.600 --> 00:59.160
Michael and I discuss some of the initial challenges associated with implementing this

00:59.160 --> 01:05.000
type of system, including skepticism among employees, and how it ultimately sets the stage

01:05.000 --> 01:10.600
for Link's broader use of machine learning AI and so-called robotic process automation

01:10.600 --> 01:16.080
to increase workforce productivity. Thanks to Pegasystems for sponsoring this show and

01:16.080 --> 01:21.360
our Pegaworld series. Amidst the discussion of automation and enhanced customer experience

01:21.360 --> 01:26.320
is that Pegaworld, the company announced several new AI-powered capabilities as part

01:26.320 --> 01:32.920
of its Pegat Infinity Process Automation Platform. For more information on Pegat Infinity,

01:32.920 --> 01:39.360
head over to pegga.com slash infinity. And now on to the show.

01:39.360 --> 01:46.400
All right, everyone. I am here at Pegaworld and I've got the pleasure of being seated

01:46.400 --> 01:52.920
with Michael Kemper. Michael is the chief operating officer of Link Market Services.

01:52.920 --> 01:56.040
Michael, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.120
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure to be here.

01:58.120 --> 02:03.200
Why don't we get started by having you tell us a little bit about your background and

02:03.200 --> 02:08.640
it sounds like you've been doing some work with machine learning and AI at Link. How

02:08.640 --> 02:12.200
did you kind of come into working with those technologies?

02:12.200 --> 02:17.240
Yeah, thank you for that. It's a great opportunity to really explain how we've been taking

02:17.240 --> 02:21.520
AI and we've taken the work with Pegat to very different levels than we've ever had

02:21.520 --> 02:25.160
in the past. So it's probably worth starting with what our industry and what our business

02:25.160 --> 02:31.040
does. So we work with corporates to basically do some outsourcing for them. So we look

02:31.040 --> 02:36.560
after the share registration, employee share plans, some investor relations. So we're

02:36.560 --> 02:40.360
the guys when there's an annual general meeting, where the people who send you the documentation

02:40.360 --> 02:44.880
and allow you to vote at a meeting, pay dividends, if there's a corporate action, those kind

02:44.880 --> 02:50.080
of things. On the employee share side, if there's a launch of an employee share plan, we'll

02:50.080 --> 02:55.120
manage all of that. That industry is a pretty mature industry. It's been around for hundreds

02:55.120 --> 03:00.800
of years and inevitably because of that, it's very product focused, very paper focused,

03:00.800 --> 03:06.560
very transactional focused. And from time to time, it's very seasonal focused as well. So

03:06.560 --> 03:10.720
an AGM only comes around once a year and they tend to be within the same three month period.

03:10.720 --> 03:16.120
So you can see there are huge spikes in volumes. An annual general meeting. Okay. So when

03:16.120 --> 03:20.880
a PLC once a year engages with their shareholders to say, this is what we want to do for the following

03:20.880 --> 03:25.320
year and that might be reappointing the directors, might be reappointing auditors, might be

03:25.320 --> 03:31.160
taking some strategic decisions around that. So and corporate actions, things like take

03:31.160 --> 03:36.480
over as mergers and acquisitions and those kind of things we do as well. So we realised

03:36.480 --> 03:43.600
as part of this that our industry was relatively manual, relatively paper based with a large number

03:43.600 --> 03:49.000
of handoffs between different parties as we go on. And we knew that a lot of that created

03:49.000 --> 03:53.800
inefficiency, probably some risk within the business and certainly not the service you

03:53.800 --> 03:58.280
would want to provide to customers and their stakeholders. And one of the things that's

03:58.280 --> 04:02.600
a little bit unique about our businesses are clients are the PLCs, so public limited

04:02.600 --> 04:08.920
companies and the corporates, whereas the stakeholders are the shareholders or in the employees.

04:08.920 --> 04:13.160
So whilst we only have, you know, to stay over a thousand clients, we have millions upon

04:13.160 --> 04:17.800
millions of stakeholders who are contacting us to say, I've changed my address. You didn't

04:17.800 --> 04:23.360
pay me a dividend. Oh, yes, you did. Can I have a replacement? All of those kind of things.

04:23.360 --> 04:27.840
So we spent, you know, a bit of time saying, how do we want to work in the industry as we

04:27.840 --> 04:33.720
go forward? And we looked at other industries and how they behaved. What we didn't know

04:33.720 --> 04:39.280
was effectively where to start on that journey. We could have taken the choice that a lot

04:39.280 --> 04:43.760
of organisations, I think, do, which was throw a lot of money at innovation and hope something

04:43.760 --> 04:49.040
sticks and hope that that will produce some good benefit. Instead, we decided to really

04:49.040 --> 04:54.360
go down almost to Donald Rumsfeld. Let's find out the unknown unknowns or the known unknowns.

04:54.360 --> 04:59.200
And to do that, we worked with Pega to implement something called workforce intelligence. Now

04:59.200 --> 05:04.360
that's a product that sits on everyone's PC and basically takes a screen grab of what

05:04.360 --> 05:09.080
people are doing on a minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day process and allows a very

05:09.080 --> 05:15.280
clear analysis of what an individual, what a team, what a department are doing. And that

05:15.280 --> 05:21.960
gave us a huge insight into our current processes, our current ways of working and indeed where

05:21.960 --> 05:28.600
the risks were behind that. Immediately we put that in, we saw a real change in behaviours.

05:28.600 --> 05:35.200
So one of the most important parts of that AI journey was the change in employee behaviour.

05:35.200 --> 05:40.640
Initially, they felt that this could be and maybe was a big brother type scenario where

05:40.640 --> 05:44.680
people were looking at their day to day work, whether that would impact them as individuals,

05:44.680 --> 05:49.000
whether that was a management tool to effectively beat them with a stick. In reality, that was

05:49.000 --> 05:53.840
never the intention. The intention was to work with the guys and say, we can see from

05:53.840 --> 05:59.280
this AI and we can see from the reports that it's generating where inefficiencies are,

05:59.280 --> 06:02.680
where an employee is toggling between two different systems to get the right service

06:02.680 --> 06:07.000
for a client or their stakeholder, where we could see there was suddenly a gap in processing

06:07.000 --> 06:11.040
because they had to go off and do a, you know, bespoke activity before they could carry

06:11.040 --> 06:15.560
on with the end-to-end journey of, of the product that we were trying to put in place at

06:15.560 --> 06:22.280
that point. So we created this environment where teams, managers and everyone involved

06:22.280 --> 06:29.040
in the process had a real window into the operating process and understanding of what was

06:29.040 --> 06:33.640
going right and probably more importantly, what was going wrong.

06:33.640 --> 06:40.640
I've got to imagine that the concerns that the team members might have initially had

06:40.640 --> 06:46.240
were really only shifted once you started to actually deliver on that information, take

06:46.240 --> 06:52.960
action on the things you learned via this reporting. What was the, and presumably, you

06:52.960 --> 06:57.560
know, built some stuff to do some things in order to, you know, for example, smooth out

06:57.560 --> 07:03.240
a process. What was the timeline, you know, from when you started getting access to

07:03.240 --> 07:07.920
this information and when you're able to actually implement change in the organization?

07:07.920 --> 07:12.760
That's exactly right. There was a lot of concern when we first put it in place, not only

07:12.760 --> 07:16.560
from the administrators and the operatives, but also the managers themselves, which is

07:16.560 --> 07:20.600
sometimes people are surprised that I say that. So let me take a couple of examples of

07:20.600 --> 07:25.200
that and then I can answer your question in full. So when we first started out on the

07:25.200 --> 07:30.560
journey, we spent a lot of time talking to the teams, training with the teams to explain

07:30.560 --> 07:35.560
what the data would be used for and how we would go down that particular journey. And effectively,

07:35.560 --> 07:41.080
we had a dual strategy, a top-down approach of these are the kind of things we want to

07:41.080 --> 07:45.040
change to make it happen and a bottom-up approach that was going to be led by the employees

07:45.040 --> 07:50.800
and their managers. We had effectively four types of people. Those who got it straight

07:50.800 --> 07:55.440
away and said, this is great, you know, really embrace the possibility to look at that data

07:55.440 --> 08:00.520
and challenge themselves. Those who kind of got the idea, but weren't convinced yet and

08:00.520 --> 08:04.160
those who were just, this is the worst thing in the world. You could happen to me. This

08:04.160 --> 08:09.960
is, you know, threaten my job. The fourth, which is the surprising one, was the managers.

08:09.960 --> 08:14.480
A lot of managers were saying, why are you putting in something that I already know? Why

08:14.480 --> 08:19.440
are you telling me how to do my job? And that was the fear factor behind that. But to answer

08:19.440 --> 08:25.240
your question, it was within the first month that we saw the change. With the good teams,

08:25.240 --> 08:29.120
and there were different journeys for different teams in different departments, we saw that

08:29.120 --> 08:33.480
very quickly on their day-to-day hurdles, because every team has a huddle in the morning

08:33.480 --> 08:37.640
around a whiteboard to see what's going to be ahead and what's going on. The good teams

08:37.640 --> 08:42.120
were using that data from day one to try and understand why there were differences in

08:42.120 --> 08:46.600
approach between team members, why people were doing things in a different way, why team

08:46.600 --> 08:50.120
member A was getting really good productivity, whereas another team member was not getting

08:50.120 --> 08:54.840
productivity. And they didn't see it as a competition or a threat to each other. They

08:54.840 --> 09:00.960
saw it as a way to really bolster the customer service and really improve quality. So those

09:00.960 --> 09:05.400
teams within the first month were suddenly seeing change.

09:05.400 --> 09:11.760
With the managers in those teams as well, we saw that very quickly, they realised that

09:11.760 --> 09:17.040
the age-old struggle of our managers managing or our managers superdoers was seen through

09:17.040 --> 09:22.440
this data very quickly. And they could understand that actually, they weren't doing their job

09:22.440 --> 09:26.600
in the way that we wanted their roles and responsibilities to be, and they were becoming

09:26.600 --> 09:31.560
superdoers. So very quickly, they were able to work with their teams and say, hold on,

09:31.560 --> 09:36.480
I shouldn't be doing this. Let me pass this down to the right people, which, funny enough,

09:36.480 --> 09:40.680
made everyone happy. The operatives were saying, finally, I'm getting to do my job to its

09:40.680 --> 09:44.720
full extent, the managers were able to manage to do quality assurance and those kind of

09:44.720 --> 09:50.760
things to go from there. But to answer your question, not every team reached that conclusion

09:50.760 --> 09:56.280
within the first month, we did, as you rightly surmised, have to put in some changes around

09:56.280 --> 10:01.560
that. And those changes were both bottom-up and top-down. So one example of the bottom-up

10:01.560 --> 10:06.800
is we found in one particular team, there were three or four ways of working for a particular

10:06.800 --> 10:12.560
function. So rather than us come in and say, we will change that for you, we actually

10:12.560 --> 10:17.240
implemented something called a power hour, which is a nice consultancy term for, we took

10:17.240 --> 10:22.360
the team away from their desk for an hour, said, here's the problem, there's four different

10:22.360 --> 10:25.920
journeys on this and we can show you the data. Please come back in an hour and tell us

10:25.920 --> 10:30.160
how you want to do this going forward. They went away, went around a whiteboard, came

10:30.160 --> 10:35.800
back, felt very empowered, and said, this is how we want to manage this process going

10:35.800 --> 10:41.440
forward. The following day, you already saw the data change. It was incredible in that

10:41.440 --> 10:47.200
type of journey. Other types of things did require change from us. So we've implemented

10:47.200 --> 10:53.240
something called a process defect log, which is from the data from the WFI, we're able

10:53.240 --> 10:58.120
to see where a process is inefficient. And just like you would have a code defect log,

10:58.120 --> 11:02.320
we're now monitoring those and saying, we will help you change those processes. Some

11:02.320 --> 11:07.840
can be very quick. It's some very simple feeds of data to different systems. Some take

11:07.840 --> 11:13.840
rather longer. And we've been using that to then implement the Pegasystem more universally

11:13.840 --> 11:20.480
to say, we now know what processes are fantastic. We know which ones are okay, and we know

11:20.480 --> 11:24.960
which ones need some attention because they're pretty broken. And the business case and

11:24.960 --> 11:30.760
the benefits from looking at those individual processes has allowed us to do that top-down

11:30.760 --> 11:36.000
approach and put pegger in place in a way that I think if you'd been scattergun, you

11:36.000 --> 11:40.040
wouldn't have got the same benefits that this is clearly shown as where to look and where

11:40.040 --> 11:46.840
to do the right work. This workforce intelligence product, WFI, is kind of capturing user screen

11:46.840 --> 11:55.280
activity. And then is it automatically categorizing that or providing some higher level analytics

11:55.280 --> 12:02.000
on top of that, or does that go back to some team or staff that you have that is kind

12:02.000 --> 12:07.280
of manually reviewing that and trying to determine the patterns of use and these things that

12:07.280 --> 12:12.680
you turn into power hours and things like that? A bit of both. Inevitably in these kind

12:12.680 --> 12:18.560
of things. So the one thing it does very well is turn us an awful lot of data. But before

12:18.560 --> 12:22.960
that happens. Such as. Let me explain. So before that happens, we had to categorize

12:22.960 --> 12:27.880
what we felt was productive versus what was non-productive. So we have our own internal

12:27.880 --> 12:32.400
operating systems as everyone does, but we also use the ubiquitous in Microsoft tools

12:32.400 --> 12:37.240
and everything else. Some people would see, say, email Microsoft Outlook as a productive

12:37.240 --> 12:41.200
tool. Some people don't. So when you're sending it up for the first time, there is a choice

12:41.200 --> 12:45.920
for you as a company to say, I believe these products are productive. These systems

12:45.920 --> 12:50.520
are productive. These ones are non-productive. And obviously you then categorize non-work

12:50.520 --> 12:56.200
as well, you know, around those kind of things. Now you will never have 100% productivity

12:56.200 --> 13:00.480
because you always want staff to be trained. You always want employees to have a break.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.560
You always want those kind of things, but you set your own targets behind that. Once

13:04.560 --> 13:11.040
you set it up, the system is fantastic at giving you an analysis to say within those productive

13:11.040 --> 13:16.640
or non-productive areas, this is what you're seeing. So give you an example of a tool that

13:16.640 --> 13:22.960
we said was productive, which was Microsoft Outlook. We hadn't realized, probably we realized

13:22.960 --> 13:27.720
but maybe not to the extent of how it was being used within operations. So we knew it was

13:27.720 --> 13:33.240
used. We used part of our end-to-end process, but in some departments and not all, it was

13:33.240 --> 13:40.120
up to 25% of the day-to-day activity within a team. So WFI gave a very quick insight to

13:40.120 --> 13:45.000
that. The no part of that is we've then got to take the choices of how we're going to change

13:45.000 --> 13:51.560
that and how we look going forward. The other argument within that was WFI also shows us

13:51.560 --> 13:58.120
when employees are going between two systems. So you can break down very quickly that say

13:58.120 --> 14:03.440
you're going between the operational system, an Excel or Word or something like that or

14:03.440 --> 14:08.280
different operational systems, and it shows you very quickly how often that's happening.

14:08.280 --> 14:13.960
And by just seeing that and by seeing the frequency drive certain behaviors and certain

14:13.960 --> 14:18.760
activity that you want to do as managers to change that behavior, because clearly every

14:18.760 --> 14:23.280
time you go between a system, there's a few seconds lost or some frequency of marginal

14:23.280 --> 14:28.400
risk or there's friction exactly behind that. And then of course, you can then compare

14:28.400 --> 14:32.280
teams and employees and see the different behaviors that are going on, which is then

14:32.280 --> 14:36.160
allow us to go back to the power hours and those kind of things to go from there.

14:36.160 --> 14:40.440
It sounds like a really interesting tool for allowing you to understand, you know, there's

14:40.440 --> 14:45.080
like theoretical understanding of your processes and then what's actually happening on the

14:45.080 --> 14:49.680
ground. And it sounds like it enables that. When you think about this tool and the way

14:49.680 --> 14:55.760
you've deployed it, what strikes you as kind of most AI or machine learning in, you know,

14:55.760 --> 14:57.200
the tool or your use of it?

14:57.200 --> 15:04.320
It's a great question. And I think it's really about dragging the assumptions that we had

15:04.320 --> 15:09.960
from the past into touch. Now that's, you may argue that's not true AI, but it really

15:09.960 --> 15:16.160
is providing an automated and a very real time feed and a window into our operating system.

15:16.160 --> 15:23.360
So I mentioned before the comparison of the ways people are working. And that is a true

15:23.360 --> 15:27.960
part of the AI. And the machine does make suggestions of where to look and saying we

15:27.960 --> 15:32.800
have noticed across the different areas. There's some big differences between behaviors.

15:32.800 --> 15:39.040
And within there is a tool that allows you to say, these are the areas you want to target

15:39.040 --> 15:44.560
to them make change. And what it also does, I guess, and it gives you the leap of face

15:44.560 --> 15:50.520
towards more AI going forward. So whilst it shows you the first step, you can then obviously

15:50.520 --> 15:56.160
go into other parts of the Pega portfolio to say, actually, I'm now going to take machine

15:56.160 --> 16:02.320
learning into that from this base tool. So it takes you to a certain point. It tip

16:02.320 --> 16:06.600
toes into a bit of machine learning, but actually to do that properly, you then probably take

16:06.600 --> 16:12.320
some other Pega tools to go from the status quo to the future state.

16:12.320 --> 16:18.960
Okay. So there's a, it sounds like an underlying belief that you can't automate what you can't

16:18.960 --> 16:25.280
really understand. So this will help you understand, again, your processes on the ground and

16:25.280 --> 16:32.040
providing on ramp to further automation. That's right. And I think a lot of us will be

16:32.040 --> 16:39.840
very familiar with people talking blockchain, workflow, AI, data, and those are solutions.

16:39.840 --> 16:46.760
Now what we often hear is, you must invest in, put one of those names in there. You must

16:46.760 --> 16:51.600
do this. You must do that. The question we should always ask ourselves is, why? What benefit

16:51.600 --> 16:54.800
is that actually going to produce, whether that's a benefit to an employee, whether that's

16:54.800 --> 17:00.880
a benefit to a customer, whatever that particular benefit is. What this tool has done is change

17:00.880 --> 17:05.880
the power, if you like, from the people who are saying, you must, you must, you must,

17:05.880 --> 17:11.520
to the actual people who are providing the service to say, what we need is, now what we need

17:11.520 --> 17:17.920
is to solve an issue, create quality, remove risk, whatever that might be. And so it gives

17:17.920 --> 17:26.040
you that step to then say, this is the requirement. Therefore, now go and implement whatever the

17:26.040 --> 17:33.480
solution is. So it's really creating an automated requirements process for one to a bit of

17:33.480 --> 17:38.480
expression that you never had in the past. And it does go back to exactly what you said.

17:38.480 --> 17:42.240
You may have assumed you may have known some of this stuff, but you didn't really know.

17:42.240 --> 17:47.360
And it's provided a very automated way to say, this is where your problem is. And this

17:47.360 --> 17:50.640
is the benefit you will get if you fix it. Because that's the other part of the tool that

17:50.640 --> 17:58.480
really is clear. If you can change your productivity from 50% to 60%, in terms of number of man hours

17:58.480 --> 18:03.520
per year, that is enormous. And that rights its business case, by itself, without any

18:03.520 --> 18:08.760
particular need for a challenge, because the facts are there. And then you pick the right

18:08.760 --> 18:13.600
solution for that, whether that be workflow, whether that be a data hub, whether it be whatever

18:13.600 --> 18:16.920
it might be to resolve that particular issue.

18:16.920 --> 18:23.360
I imagine that you had some visibility into individual employee productivity going into

18:23.360 --> 18:29.200
this process. You had to have a sense of, you know, these are your A players, they process

18:29.200 --> 18:37.200
3x the volume of some other employees. But you've mentioned several times that it gives

18:37.200 --> 18:42.040
you kind of visibility into that productivity. When you say that is it, again, kind of going

18:42.040 --> 18:48.240
back to this understanding of like the why of the productivity or their aspects of productivity

18:48.240 --> 18:53.760
that weren't readily apparent to you before you had this visibility?

18:53.760 --> 19:00.120
Both. So the why is very important. And no one comes to well. Very few people come to

19:00.120 --> 19:05.520
work wanting to do a bad job. Yeah, everyone wants to do the best of their ability. Sometimes

19:05.520 --> 19:10.280
when people aren't as productive, people jump to conclusions that it's around the capabilities

19:10.280 --> 19:14.840
of that person, it's their attitude, whatever it might be. The reality is sometimes it

19:14.840 --> 19:18.960
might be we have set up that employee not to be as productive as the person sitting next

19:18.960 --> 19:22.840
to them because we may not have given them the same tools to do the job, the same training,

19:22.840 --> 19:28.840
the same experience and all of those kind of things to do that. So WFI allows you to see

19:28.840 --> 19:33.600
what they are doing differently to that person who is very productive. Is that an experience

19:33.600 --> 19:37.520
thing? Is that the way they are working? Do they need different training, different coaching,

19:37.520 --> 19:43.040
whatever it might be? And by investing in that, we've seen a real uptick in exactly what

19:43.040 --> 19:46.960
you were just mentioning the performance in certain individuals where historically you

19:46.960 --> 19:50.560
might have said, I need to put them on a performance improvement plan for all the

19:50.560 --> 19:56.040
wrong reasons. This now provides an improvement plan that is for all the right reasons and

19:56.040 --> 20:04.680
we're seeing real benefits behind that. So that in itself is being super helpful. The

20:04.680 --> 20:09.200
other side of that is it's provided employees that self-help. They can actually now turn

20:09.200 --> 20:13.520
around because they see the data as much as anyone else and say, I am struggling because

20:13.520 --> 20:18.000
of, please come and help me, please come and put in some change and those solutions

20:18.000 --> 20:24.040
I was talking about a second ago to make sure that not only is there, process more efficient,

20:24.040 --> 20:29.440
but we give better quality to clients, etc. So we've talked about this insight, this

20:29.440 --> 20:34.360
visibility as kind of the on ramp to true machine learning and AI. How far are you along

20:34.360 --> 20:35.360
that path?

20:35.360 --> 20:42.480
Yes, it's a great question. So we only put WFI in January 2017, 18 months or so ago.

20:42.480 --> 20:47.000
And we saw a huge change in the first six to 12 months and now inevitably it's beginning

20:47.000 --> 20:53.040
to level out a bit. But what it did do, as you rightly surmised, is give us the opportunity

20:53.040 --> 21:00.760
to say, and now what? Now let's do the top down stuff. And we've implemented one layer

21:00.760 --> 21:04.800
of our next steps, but we're about to introduce the second, which is really the bit you're

21:04.800 --> 21:09.000
probably going to be interested in. So the first layer we put in place was we re-looked

21:09.000 --> 21:15.680
at the way clients contact us in terms of paper form. And we've used the Pega system

21:15.680 --> 21:21.760
to digitalise our postroom and start putting a very, very automated process in place, which

21:21.760 --> 21:26.520
isn't true machine learning at this point. What we're also doing, though, is the second

21:26.520 --> 21:32.560
part of how our stakeholders contact with us. So paper is one, call centres are another.

21:32.560 --> 21:42.040
And we're starting to implement the call centre module out of Pega to really understand

21:42.040 --> 21:46.320
not only how our process is on the call centre, but to start doing machine learning. So we

21:46.320 --> 21:51.240
are already starting to see, in our proof of concept, the pop-ups on the machine to

21:51.240 --> 21:56.440
say, based on the first part of this conversation, we're expecting to see this kind of

21:56.440 --> 22:00.080
behaviour. These are the answers you need to give, and really helping our opportunities

22:00.080 --> 22:03.960
give a better service to the people who call up. And that's the bit that starts to excite

22:03.960 --> 22:10.920
me. From there, if that works, we're going to start introducing the robotic webchat around

22:10.920 --> 22:15.480
things where instead of just having a call centre, we move away from the traditional

22:15.480 --> 22:19.960
webchat, which is actually just two people emailing each other and calling it a webchat,

22:19.960 --> 22:26.160
to a machine learned way of doing things where very quickly we can see people's behaviours

22:26.160 --> 22:30.880
putting the key words and start learning about how to either answer their questions or take

22:30.880 --> 22:36.440
them to the right page on our web portal, talk them through, or machine talk them through

22:36.440 --> 22:42.960
a process, so there's a lot more self-help. And we've seen in other industries that self-services

22:42.960 --> 22:48.000
is the way people want to go, and to have machine learning do that is really important.

22:48.000 --> 22:54.360
Yeah, I've spoken before at conferences about, we have a lot to learn from other industries,

22:54.360 --> 22:58.280
and the travel industry is a great example. I'm old enough to remember the booklets of

22:58.280 --> 23:02.840
tickets where you ripped them out as you went through the airport. They went through a process

23:02.840 --> 23:09.560
of self-service where they put all the cost onto us as travelers, and we thank them for

23:09.560 --> 23:13.320
it. I don't want to do that. I don't want to put cost onto someone else, but I do want

23:13.320 --> 23:18.840
to provide a self-service process where machines pay apart to that, to those people who want

23:18.840 --> 23:24.240
it. Our business is one where the demographics are, some people embrace that massively. That's

23:24.240 --> 23:28.880
their expectations. Some of our other demographics probably aren't ready for that yet. So we always

23:28.880 --> 23:35.760
have to provide the two options, whether that be machine learning contact or pick up the phone

23:35.760 --> 23:39.360
and speak to someone, but in the background, we've got machine learning helping those people

23:39.360 --> 23:46.320
give the right service. Yeah, that was a big theme in the key notes this morning, and across

23:46.320 --> 23:54.160
the industry really is the continued consumerization of IT, if you will, meaning people's expectations

23:54.160 --> 24:02.080
have risen to the level of what they experience every day via their phone and the consumer offerings,

24:02.080 --> 24:07.680
and now as businesses, we're expected to deliver on that. Yeah, and we've seen technology jumps,

24:07.680 --> 24:15.200
too. So we have all demographics who hold shares. The older generation often are cited as people

24:15.200 --> 24:19.760
who they want paper, they want to do things in a certain way, but that's just not true. We see

24:19.760 --> 24:25.280
that whilst they didn't like PCs and laptops, a lot of more on their tablets and their phones,

24:25.280 --> 24:30.480
FaceTiming, the children, booking holidays and everything else. So one of the things in terms of

24:30.480 --> 24:36.080
how we use machines is to link into the expectations of those different demographics,

24:36.080 --> 24:43.040
and you are right, we're seeing people expect things to happen immediately. If they wait 30 seconds

24:43.040 --> 24:48.560
for someone to pick up the phone, they get frustrated. Whereas a couple of years ago, no one cared.

24:48.560 --> 24:53.920
Right. Equally, when they do a web chat to use their previous example, waiting for someone to

24:53.920 --> 24:59.680
answer is no longer acceptable. You want an immediate answer. So depending on those stakeholders

24:59.680 --> 25:05.440
and how they engage, machine learning and machine interaction is becoming more and more important

25:05.440 --> 25:13.360
for those particular stakeholder groups and their expectations. So in continuing down this path

25:13.360 --> 25:21.520
towards incorporating more machine learning, more AI into your operations, on the one hand,

25:21.520 --> 25:27.200
you're absorbing a lot of technology and expertise via the vendor relationship,

25:28.080 --> 25:36.160
but I'm curious as well, what kind of, what you've had to do internally in terms of skills,

25:36.160 --> 25:41.200
competencies, development efforts, things like that in order to fully embrace this.

25:41.200 --> 25:46.480
Yes. Yeah, it's a great question. I think you're right. You have different stakeholder groups

25:46.480 --> 25:51.280
who move in a different way. So clients and their stakeholders we've talked about, and it's

25:51.280 --> 25:57.040
a different journey. Internally, we have had to invest. So even though I talk about the top down

25:57.040 --> 26:03.680
and the bottom up, ultimately that is a business transformation type role. And everyone is very busy,

26:03.680 --> 26:07.760
and it's quite a difficult thing to get the operational teams who are the day-to-day running

26:07.760 --> 26:12.640
in operations to think in a much more strategic leadership way to embrace those kind of things.

26:13.760 --> 26:18.560
So we did invest in a central team, as Natalie, known as the business transformation

26:18.560 --> 26:21.840
and service excellence team, you know, took us a long time to come up with that title, obviously.

26:22.640 --> 26:29.520
And their job was not to sit centrally and create ideas, but to really get out into the

26:29.520 --> 26:34.640
business teams, sit with the teams, understand what was going on, and start training them in

26:34.640 --> 26:41.040
different ways of working. So we have a group of core routines that we've embedded into the

26:41.040 --> 26:46.560
business, which, yeah, I'll link to the Six Sigma type of activities, but it's the daily

26:46.560 --> 26:52.960
huddles to understand what's going on to utilize the MI moving forward. They challenged people

26:52.960 --> 26:59.120
around what is your daily MI that you would normally have and look at, and is that really fit

26:59.120 --> 27:04.480
for purpose? And how can we use machine learning to change that kind of behavior and move things forward?

27:04.480 --> 27:10.160
So really simple example on the call center. You know, some of the MI we had in the past was

27:10.160 --> 27:16.320
useful, but what it didn't tell me was how many times did you call? You know, what was your tone

27:16.320 --> 27:22.320
when you called back the last time? You know, were you relaxed, frustrated, and machine learning can

27:22.320 --> 27:27.040
pick up some of that stuff and give different data? Did you call in with you saying,

27:27.040 --> 27:31.200
that's great, thank you, you've answered my question, or did it end up with you writing a complaint?

27:31.200 --> 27:36.480
So bringing all of those pieces together and that central team really joining up the different

27:36.480 --> 27:41.600
departments to do things in a consistent way and use that data and learning consistently

27:41.600 --> 27:46.720
was an investment we had to make. Of course, some of those people are trained in change,

27:46.720 --> 27:52.720
you know, the Six Sigma type activity, but what we didn't want to do, as I already said, is sit

27:52.720 --> 27:57.120
those guys centrally and they sit in their ivory tower telling people what to do. Yeah,

27:57.120 --> 28:01.120
once they come together and make sure things are consistent, they are embedded in the business

28:01.120 --> 28:07.840
as part of the local teams. And did they, did you build that team with pre-existing experience

28:07.840 --> 28:13.680
around machine learning technologies and what, you know, what's possible, what's not possible there,

28:13.680 --> 28:20.720
or did you train them in those types of things? Combination. So some of the team were

28:20.720 --> 28:27.200
brought in because they were experts in change. Okay. Yeah, around looking at operating models

28:27.200 --> 28:32.960
and saying, how do we want to do things differently and go from there? Some of those people are experts

28:32.960 --> 28:38.320
in technology. So fun enough, we do have, you know, one young lady who actually used to work for

28:38.320 --> 28:43.280
PEGA. Yeah, here is a business process architect, but she understands that machine learning very,

28:43.280 --> 28:48.880
very well. It does a lot of work in robotics and can bring that flavor. So like all teams,

28:48.880 --> 28:53.520
you need diversity. Yeah, as I'm in America, I talk about American football and American football

28:53.520 --> 28:58.400
team with only quarterbacks, doesn't work. Yeah. So it's the same with our transformation team. We

28:58.400 --> 29:02.640
need, you know, people who can do analysis, people who can do end-to-end processing analysis,

29:02.640 --> 29:07.360
people who can look at change, people who can implement that change, and of course, people who

29:07.360 --> 29:12.640
understand robotics, AI, machine learning, et cetera. Yeah. Part of what I'm finding interesting

29:12.640 --> 29:20.720
in this conversation is I talk to a lot of folks that are building data science teams and trying

29:20.720 --> 29:25.840
to understand or think through how to structure those. Do we centralize them? Do we decentralize

29:25.840 --> 29:35.520
them? And it strikes me as, it strikes me that a lot of companies are figuring the same things out

29:35.520 --> 29:40.960
or have figured the same things out as regards to other change initiatives, whether it's digital

29:40.960 --> 29:47.280
transformation or ERP before that or something else before that. It's not just technology,

29:47.280 --> 29:55.680
technology, process, people, all these things together, and a balance of the folks that I've

29:55.680 --> 30:02.960
talked to that are most sophisticated about bringing data science to an organization,

30:02.960 --> 30:07.840
kind of start the conversation with, you know, it's about culture and it's about people and it's

30:07.840 --> 30:12.720
about building and understanding of what's possible. And, you know, then there are different

30:12.720 --> 30:17.520
approaches to, you know, which problems you buy it off and how you manage the portfolio,

30:17.520 --> 30:23.040
but it strikes me that that, you know, that central piece around, you know, again,

30:23.040 --> 30:29.280
people process culture, it's critical. You're exactly right. And I think if you start from the,

30:29.280 --> 30:35.440
we want to introduce machine learning, you'll fail. Yeah. If you start from what am I trying to

30:35.440 --> 30:40.880
achieve? And generally, you know, it's a small list. It's normally increased quality, reduced risk,

30:40.880 --> 30:46.240
potentially increased margin if your company's, you know, pushing it that it's probably,

30:46.240 --> 30:50.640
it should be, not always, employee well-being and making sure people have got the tools to do

30:50.640 --> 30:55.520
their job and, you know, are happy in their jobs because that creates productivity and in itself

30:55.520 --> 31:00.480
will increase margin. It's starting with those and understanding what you want to achieve.

31:00.480 --> 31:06.320
You know, is it saying I want to get rid of incidents, complaints, high quality, whatever it might

31:06.320 --> 31:11.840
be? And then that will lead you to exactly what you said, process culture, technology, technology

31:11.840 --> 31:17.040
is one of the tools you will put that right with. There are others. Yeah. Some of that's around

31:17.040 --> 31:22.480
the structure of your business. Yeah. Are you set up in a way that, you know, talk, say,

31:22.480 --> 31:27.280
spans and layers within your business? Yeah. How many deep is your operational structure?

31:27.280 --> 31:32.480
Is that efficient? Nothing to do with technology, but it does provide a very different structure

31:32.480 --> 31:38.240
for employee well-being and how they feel and career paths and everything else associated with that.

31:39.200 --> 31:44.480
Technology is just another element of that. And yeah, as I said, if you start with that,

31:44.480 --> 31:48.320
I strongly believe you'll fail. You've got to have a real reason for putting that in place

31:48.320 --> 31:52.800
and understanding what's going on. And it will constantly change. Yeah. I remember I'm

31:52.800 --> 31:57.120
sadly old enough to remember the debate around whether you have Excel or Lotus 123.

31:57.120 --> 32:04.640
Yeah. And today, I'm sorry, then that was a big question. Do we want to implement these things?

32:05.200 --> 32:09.600
Now, you find a business that doesn't think Excel is part and parcel of what you have.

32:10.160 --> 32:13.360
So some of the things we're talking about today in 10 years time, people will go,

32:13.360 --> 32:18.720
why are you even asking that question? That is just the nature of our job. And as we see,

32:18.720 --> 32:22.480
the change in employees, it's going to be really, really interesting because as you said,

32:22.480 --> 32:28.880
technology is changing incredibly fast. Some employees are still questioning some of this stuff,

32:29.520 --> 32:35.040
and are very wedded to certain ways of working. Graduates coming through are saying, why using email?

32:36.000 --> 32:41.680
Yeah, I don't use email anymore. It's all messaging. So we are seeing this technology change not

32:41.680 --> 32:47.920
just with our clients, but internally as well. And again, as I said already said, using that technology

32:47.920 --> 32:54.720
to deliver the benefits and the things you want as part of your target operating model is key.

32:54.720 --> 32:58.960
But you've got to understand why. What are you trying to achieve? What are your objectives?

32:58.960 --> 33:02.000
Putting something in for putting it in just will not work.

33:03.120 --> 33:11.680
And so, I want to ask how you articulate the vision for AI and machine learning

33:11.680 --> 33:17.200
with the broader stakeholders in your organization. But I'm wondering if the vision for AI and

33:17.200 --> 33:21.280
machine learning even includes talking about machine learning and AI at the level that you're

33:22.480 --> 33:28.720
operating? It very much does. So as part of our target operating model, we regularly do stand-ups

33:28.720 --> 33:33.920
to all of our employees, whether that's in small groups as teams or whether we do big town hall

33:33.920 --> 33:38.720
type structures. And we tend to focus on a different subject each time. So it might be people in

33:38.720 --> 33:45.040
culture, one quarter, it might be technology another. And as part of that technology, some of the

33:45.040 --> 33:51.440
debates are actually great. Again, the different employees who have different feelings towards this

33:51.440 --> 33:56.240
are really discussing and saying, how do we want to do this? How do we want to move it forward?

33:56.880 --> 34:01.680
To the other end of people who are very scared of it still. There is still an expectation sometimes

34:01.680 --> 34:06.640
that machine learning means a reduction in roles. It really doesn't. It actually means

34:07.760 --> 34:12.400
creating those roles and giving the employees the chance to do their job properly

34:12.400 --> 34:18.800
and really change the way they are performing to provide what we all want to do. Everyone wants to

34:18.800 --> 34:24.640
provide the best quality to their clients. Machine learning allows you to do that and it's just

34:24.640 --> 34:30.560
having those conversations and bringing people on. I can guarantee you that if I sat centrally

34:30.560 --> 34:37.040
and just put an edict and says, we are now going to do X, there'd be uproar. Communication is key

34:37.040 --> 34:42.480
on all of this stuff and I would be incredibly arrogant if I thought I knew everything about

34:42.480 --> 34:47.520
machine learning sitting centrally. Actually, the guys who are doing the job day-to-day

34:47.520 --> 34:52.560
every moment of the day are the ones who really benefit and really want it because they see the

34:52.560 --> 35:00.000
true benefit immediately. So it is going back to that communication piece working together

35:00.000 --> 35:04.560
in not just his employees, but as a board to say, where do we want to do this? So we started on

35:04.560 --> 35:08.320
the operational side, but of course machine learning will come on the cell side as well,

35:08.320 --> 35:13.440
come on our dealing side so we do some shared dealing. Machine learning is going to be able to tell

35:13.440 --> 35:19.440
us when the peaks are going to be, how people are going to behave in certain market changes.

35:19.440 --> 35:24.880
We live in a very, very unstable world at the moment. It will be great as we move down this

35:24.880 --> 35:29.040
AI journey and this machine learning journey to be able to predict better how people are going

35:29.040 --> 35:34.320
to behave in certain circumstances. I really appreciate you taking the time to kind of walk us

35:34.320 --> 35:38.960
through the way you're approaching this. It sounds like you've got a kind of an interesting

35:38.960 --> 35:42.960
set of plans ahead of you. No, thank you. It's been my absolute pleasure and I think,

35:42.960 --> 35:47.760
hopefully you've got a taste of the fact that at the end of the day, our employee wellbeing

35:47.760 --> 35:52.720
and our client's quality is at the heart of everything we do. Machine learning and what we've

35:52.720 --> 35:58.960
used so far with WFI and with PEGA is really starting to make a difference in that scenario.

35:58.960 --> 36:03.120
And we're at the beginning. We've got a long way to go in that. We know that, but it's been an

36:03.120 --> 36:07.920
exciting start. There's a lot more to do, but hopefully I've given you a flavour of that today of

36:07.920 --> 36:11.280
where we started and where we're going to. Absolutely. Thank you, Michael. Thank you.

36:17.760 --> 36:23.600
All right, everyone. That's our show for today. For more information on Michael or any of the
