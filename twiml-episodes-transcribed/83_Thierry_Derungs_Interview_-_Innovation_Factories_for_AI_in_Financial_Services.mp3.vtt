00:00.000 --> 00:15.920
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

00:15.920 --> 00:20.880
people doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.440
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:23.440 --> 00:28.040
This week on the podcast features a series of conversations with speakers from the AI

00:28.040 --> 00:29.840
Summit in New York City.

00:29.840 --> 00:35.120
The theme of that conference and this series is AI in the Enterprise and I think you'll

00:35.120 --> 00:41.160
find a really interesting mix of both technical and case study oriented discussions this week.

00:41.160 --> 00:46.280
Please note that on Wednesday December 13th we'll be holding our last Twimble online

00:46.280 --> 00:48.280
meet-up of the year.

00:48.280 --> 00:52.440
Bring your thoughts on the top machine learning and AI stories of 2017 for our discussion

00:52.440 --> 00:58.760
segment and for our main presentation Bruno Gensalves will be discussing the paper understanding

00:58.760 --> 01:04.960
deep learning requires rethinking generalization by Shi Yuan Zhang from MIT and Google Brain

01:04.960 --> 01:06.200
and others.

01:06.200 --> 01:11.160
You can find more details and register at twimbleai.com slash meet-up.

01:11.160 --> 01:16.280
Today's show continues our discussion of Enterprise AI with a conversation with Terry

01:16.280 --> 01:24.840
Deroong's chief digital officer at BNP Paribus a multinational bank headquartered in Paris.

01:24.840 --> 01:30.120
Terry joined me to discuss how BNP uses AI and some of the opportunities that have arisen

01:30.120 --> 01:34.160
with the changing artificial intelligence landscape.

01:34.160 --> 01:39.400
We also discuss the innovation process that BNP is used to introduce AI to the bank via

01:39.400 --> 01:43.200
what they call innovation incubators or factories.

01:43.200 --> 01:49.360
The notes for this show can be found at twimbleai.com slash talk slash 81.

01:49.360 --> 01:54.840
This AI summit series is brought to you by our friends at IBM Power Systems.

01:54.840 --> 01:59.440
IBM Power Systems offers servers designed for mission critical applications and emerging

01:59.440 --> 02:05.240
workloads including artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, advanced

02:05.240 --> 02:08.920
analytics, and high performance computing.

02:08.920 --> 02:14.120
IBM Power Systems benefit from a wide range of open technologies, many stemming from

02:14.120 --> 02:19.440
collaboration with fellow open power foundation members and their design to deliver performance

02:19.440 --> 02:24.640
efficiently, whether deployed in private, public, or hybrid clouds.

02:34.960 --> 02:41.960
And now onto the show.

02:41.960 --> 02:45.400
All right, everyone.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.960
I am on the line with Terry Derung's.

02:48.960 --> 02:56.200
Terry is the Chief Digital Officer at BNP Paribus Wealth Management.

02:56.200 --> 03:00.680
And he is, we're connecting today, he's in Paris.

03:00.680 --> 03:04.920
And Terry, I'm very grateful for you to spend some time with us.

03:04.920 --> 03:05.920
My pleasure.

03:05.920 --> 03:06.920
Absolutely.

03:06.920 --> 03:12.680
So, all right, Terry, why don't we get started by having you introduce yourself to the

03:12.680 --> 03:18.400
audience and tell us a little bit about your background and how you came to be interested

03:18.400 --> 03:20.920
and involved in artificial intelligence?

03:20.920 --> 03:21.920
Sure.

03:21.920 --> 03:26.080
Today, I'm the Chief Digital Officer for BNP Paribus Management.

03:26.080 --> 03:33.360
As you mentioned, yeah, I have a very long story around digital since I'm busy with digital

03:33.360 --> 03:41.640
topics since almost 25 years when the CDO title was not yet imagined and already working

03:41.640 --> 03:47.480
for many digital solutions on public sites and secure sites.

03:47.480 --> 03:49.840
So a very long background.

03:49.840 --> 03:56.280
And of course, as a CDO, yeah, you are looking for the new technologies and all the opportunities

03:56.280 --> 03:58.800
that can be raised by them.

03:58.800 --> 03:59.800
Right.

03:59.800 --> 04:26.720
And for those that aren't familiar with BNP Paribus, can you give a little bit of an overview

04:26.720 --> 04:30.440
of the firm?

04:30.440 --> 04:31.520
BNP Paribus is what we call a universal bank.

04:31.520 --> 04:40.040
So today, we are about 190,000 employees in a bit more than 80 countries coming back

04:40.040 --> 04:42.440
to West Management.

04:42.440 --> 04:47.480
So we are part, of course, from what we call the investment solution.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.720
So that's a big division from the group.

04:49.720 --> 04:54.480
But West Management, luckily for us, I should say, we are pretty small.

04:54.480 --> 05:08.120
We are about 6,600 employees in 21 countries, managing a lot of assets, about 360 billion

05:08.120 --> 05:11.200
asset under management, very efficient.

05:11.200 --> 05:19.200
But what is very nice is that our size is pretty small, which allows us to behave as

05:19.200 --> 05:25.480
a kind of startup inside a very big group that can be paralyzed.

05:25.480 --> 05:26.480
Okay.

05:26.480 --> 05:27.840
That's a big startup.

05:27.840 --> 05:28.840
Yeah.

05:28.840 --> 05:29.840
Sure.

05:29.840 --> 05:32.680
But yeah, compared to the size of the enterprise.

05:32.680 --> 05:33.680
Right.

05:33.680 --> 05:43.680
And so certainly in an organization like BNP Paribus, there are lots of opportunities to

05:43.680 --> 05:51.560
apply machine learning and artificial intelligence, how do you think about those various opportunities

05:51.560 --> 05:55.600
and what does that landscape look like for you?

05:55.600 --> 06:02.880
So as I like to say, first, the CDO is not for a chief digital officer, it's more for

06:02.880 --> 06:05.000
a chief disruption officer.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Kind of.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.000
Kind of correctly, right?

06:08.000 --> 06:09.000
Yeah.

06:09.000 --> 06:18.840
So I'm a gentle disruptor or a disruptive gentleman, nevertheless, my duty is really

06:18.840 --> 06:24.880
to transform the company to support the different countries in that way for us management.

06:24.880 --> 06:32.560
So looking to all the opportunities, artificial intelligence is at our side a very hot topic

06:32.560 --> 06:34.520
on which we are working.

06:34.520 --> 06:41.560
I would say it's a kind of old story, if I may say so, as for, for example, robot advisory

06:41.560 --> 06:47.920
is a very well-known topic for financial and especially wealth management.

06:47.920 --> 06:54.880
And we have already a robot advisory since almost three years now in place.

06:54.880 --> 07:02.320
Even if we we provide the advice not directly to the clients, but to our relationship manager

07:02.320 --> 07:09.560
because we are a human based, let's say, commercial approach, but that kind of topic exists

07:09.560 --> 07:12.680
already since long at our side.

07:12.680 --> 07:19.440
And it goes together with all the challenges that you could have on big data, not because

07:19.440 --> 07:24.640
it's big, but because you have to analyze that amount of data.

07:24.640 --> 07:29.920
And artificial intelligence is really something very important in that area.

07:29.920 --> 07:37.800
And many more opportunities knowing that we strongly believe that voice will be the new

07:37.800 --> 07:40.680
interface for the future.

07:40.680 --> 07:47.320
And when you say voice, you need an LP, so natural language processing, you need a semantic

07:47.320 --> 07:53.080
analysis, and all that is supported by artificial intelligence.

07:53.080 --> 07:59.600
And finally, the world is changing is very challenging in terms of, let's say, profit

07:59.600 --> 08:03.520
and the way we can manage the business.

08:03.520 --> 08:10.360
So we have a very strong focus on being efficient.

08:10.360 --> 08:19.520
And there you connect to the other topic, which is our APA, so the robotic process automation,

08:19.520 --> 08:22.640
which is also related to artificial intelligence.

08:22.640 --> 08:29.480
So there is a lot of things ongoing, a lot of opportunities on which we are today

08:29.480 --> 08:31.480
working pretty hard.

08:31.480 --> 08:40.960
You mentioned some of the long history of AI in general and even prior projects at the

08:40.960 --> 08:42.800
bank.

08:42.800 --> 08:48.920
What is it that makes AI hot right now for an organization like yours?

08:48.920 --> 08:56.480
I mean, it's certainly, a lot of the technologies have been around for a while, and in fact, banks

08:56.480 --> 09:05.840
in general have been early adopters of both machine learning and some of the types of technologies

09:05.840 --> 09:08.760
we associate with AI today.

09:08.760 --> 09:12.560
What do you think is, or do you think there's something different about what's happening

09:12.560 --> 09:14.880
right now and what is that?

09:14.880 --> 09:20.560
There are several factors, so regarding in the Paris-Barréne-Barréne-Barréne-Barréne-Barréne-Barréne-Barréne-Barréne management,

09:20.560 --> 09:28.440
we have launched the digital transformations five years ago and to be very transparent

09:28.440 --> 09:34.720
the first focus was really to build the foundations because yes, there is management,

09:34.720 --> 09:23.360
it is there traditional, it's the same for us inside there in

09:23.360 --> 09:30.680
five years ago. And to be very transparent, the first focus was really to build

09:30.680 --> 09:37.360
the foundations because, yes, West Management is very traditional. That's the

09:37.360 --> 09:44.480
same for us, since I'd be in Bebaba, meaning that as we have a very human-based

09:44.480 --> 09:51.800
model, that made that digital was a bit far away. So it was really, the first

09:51.800 --> 09:57.480
focus was really to build up good foundations, which are very classic. And once

09:57.480 --> 10:04.640
those foundations were achieved, then we had the capacity to accelerate and really

10:04.640 --> 10:13.080
let's say move into the more disruptive area that we could imagine by building

10:13.080 --> 10:18.880
different factories in the countries. So today we have three factories, which

10:18.880 --> 10:24.760
are really incubators and accelerators for us, allowing to work directly with

10:24.760 --> 10:32.760
clients, build up some MVP, so minimum viable products that we can test in real

10:32.760 --> 10:38.960
situation with clients. And then for the successful ones, move to what we call

10:38.960 --> 10:44.040
the industrialization, so really to make the deployments from those new

10:44.040 --> 10:51.840
services or solutions to all our clients. Having factories now, I know as to

10:51.840 --> 10:59.520
really move forward into more, let's say, specific topics. And artificial

10:59.520 --> 11:05.040
intelligence is one of them. Today we are, for example, working with the

11:05.040 --> 11:10.640
factory that we have in Singapore, around the the classic chatbot that

11:10.640 --> 11:17.080
supported by artificial intelligence, but also voice bots, because we have a

11:17.080 --> 11:21.400
strong belief that we need relationship managers, but we want them to be

11:21.400 --> 11:29.240
relationship managers 2.0. So augmented relationship managers. And for that, we

11:29.240 --> 11:34.800
see a lot of opportunities in artificial intelligence to really increase their

11:34.800 --> 11:41.720
capacity to be straight to the point, more accurate, get rid of some, let's say

11:41.720 --> 11:48.040
administrative tasks where the added value is not there and give really to them

11:48.040 --> 11:52.840
the capacity to better reply to clients, have more time to spend with their

11:52.840 --> 11:57.120
clients, and take really all the most that we can offer in the other

11:57.120 --> 12:02.920
relationship in terms of expertise, and really let's say the most important

12:02.920 --> 12:07.400
discussion that they could have with their clients about their assets and

12:07.400 --> 12:12.880
artificial intelligence, the opportunities we see is really to expand their

12:12.880 --> 12:18.200
capacities. That's a very strong belief that we have. So these factories that

12:18.200 --> 12:25.000
you're describing are digital factories, and it sounds like what's making,

12:25.000 --> 12:32.080
sounds like a big part of what's making AI timely for you is that you're better

12:32.080 --> 12:38.800
positioned to do something with it, right? The bank is built out capacity from

12:38.800 --> 12:46.720
a digital perspective that positions it to take advantage of AI, and in a way

12:46.720 --> 12:53.520
that it maybe wasn't able to do at least broadly years ago. Yeah, what has

12:53.520 --> 13:00.640
changed really a lot with the factories is that we have now the capacity in the

13:00.640 --> 13:07.800
way we manage your factories to work on business use case. So we are not looking

13:07.800 --> 13:14.320
we are not an IT company, so more or less I should say I don't care about the

13:14.320 --> 13:21.280
technology. I'm interested by the opportunities that we could have for the

13:21.280 --> 13:26.800
clients to provide them added value, and by the way to do that we need some

13:26.800 --> 13:33.720
technologies. So that's really the shift that we have. Digital is not any more

13:33.720 --> 13:41.080
inside Ben-Bedariba, a kind of geek island where some strange people on

13:41.080 --> 13:46.000
digital try to influence the way the business should be done. We have shift

13:46.000 --> 13:53.160
that back really to business and when we take initiative in a factory, first

13:53.160 --> 13:59.400
we do that in the startup mode with a lot of co-design and pure

13:59.400 --> 14:06.400
iGiStream approach. The product owner is an expert from the business coming

14:06.400 --> 14:12.200
for his expertise and we are able to help him in terms of methodology and so on,

14:12.200 --> 14:18.520
but he's really focusing on the clients and the way to provide added value.

14:18.520 --> 14:25.760
So that's really a big shift because it allows really to experiment new

14:25.760 --> 14:32.960
approach, new way of working and new ideas, really connected to clients because

14:32.960 --> 14:39.640
we have clients that work with us inside the factories from the very initial

14:39.640 --> 14:48.640
IED concept until the MVP and tests really in production, real situation with real

14:48.640 --> 14:55.120
clients and then failure suddenly becomes an option. So we have now the

14:55.120 --> 15:01.760
capacity to really take a subject, try to find the best way to address. If it's

15:01.760 --> 15:07.160
not working, okay, we find another way, we change the technology, we change the

15:07.160 --> 15:13.440
startup with which we are working or we change the concept itself and we

15:13.440 --> 15:20.880
can adapt a lot. Artificial intelligence is, as I will explain at the summit

15:20.880 --> 15:28.160
beginning of December, is really an unknown area. We know that there are a lot

15:28.160 --> 15:34.240
of opportunities but it's very difficult to really see what will be the real

15:34.240 --> 15:41.080
complexity to have that. What are really the added value for the customers and

15:41.080 --> 15:49.440
of course for the bank. So being able to experiment that very quickly while not

15:49.440 --> 15:56.240
having a prototype disconnected from the real life but reaching really a product

15:56.240 --> 16:02.640
that we can test is, yeah, it's key. If you want really to explore artificial

16:02.640 --> 16:09.840
intelligence, do you find that there are any ways in which AI has required you to

16:09.840 --> 16:19.320
evolve your factory model or your your agile methodologies MVP approach. So far

16:19.320 --> 16:25.960
the the way we work inside the the factory is really perfect for artificial

16:25.960 --> 16:33.320
intelligence. So today for, for example, working on the voice bot to expand the

16:33.320 --> 16:38.600
capacities from the relationship managers. We do that with a very short

16:38.600 --> 16:44.240
sprint or short cycle, delivering something that we we can test, evaluate,

16:44.240 --> 16:50.680
adapt and then move to the next step. And that in a very fast approach, so it's

16:50.680 --> 16:58.480
when we we work on MVP, usually it's it's about four months to really deliver

16:58.480 --> 17:06.360
something that we can put into the hands of our customers. And the capacity

17:06.360 --> 17:12.960
that we have to adapt constantly is the best approach in terms of discovering

17:12.960 --> 17:19.000
something pretty new as artificial intelligence, especially when it comes to

17:19.000 --> 17:28.240
an LP semantic analysis, which are really for us new technologies, new ways of

17:28.240 --> 17:34.840
thinking. And having that faculty to really adapt all the time is crucial. Can

17:34.840 --> 17:39.720
you tell us a little bit about the chatbot and voice bot projects that you've

17:39.720 --> 17:45.880
launched. So the story started in June this year with the International

17:45.880 --> 17:51.800
Hackathon, which is organized by the Paribag group. And in which West Management

17:51.800 --> 17:57.920
is very active. Yeah, so we have participated to the the hackathon in seven

17:57.920 --> 18:03.800
countries for West Management. So meaning having a real West Management challenge

18:03.800 --> 18:10.440
to address. And the challenge at the start for Singapore was chatbot,

18:10.440 --> 18:16.160
globally speaking. But during the weekend of the hackathon, and I had a pleasure

18:16.160 --> 18:23.680
to spend 48 hours really on the floor with the startups, because of all the

18:23.680 --> 18:30.400
discussions and so on, there had been one startup who moved from the pure

18:30.400 --> 18:38.240
classic chatbot approach to the voice bots and having the ideas to have to

18:38.240 --> 18:42.840
hook man the capacity from the relationship manager. And they will, they

18:42.840 --> 18:48.480
want the one, sorry, the hackathon session in Singapore. Because of that, we

18:48.480 --> 18:54.200
took them and then okay, when someone wins with West Management in the hackathon,

18:54.200 --> 18:58.480
it's because we want to do something right after. So come with us in the

18:58.480 --> 19:06.560
factory work with us. And we want to reach the MVP with you. And by the way,

19:06.560 --> 19:11.680
it's the first of December. It's at what we call the demo days. So it's the big

19:11.680 --> 19:18.400
final of the international hackathon. It could be in Paris. We truly hope that

19:18.400 --> 19:24.840
our startup from Singapore will be a winner in that final date where all the

19:24.840 --> 19:31.880
startups from all around the world will compete for a final price. Okay, okay.

19:31.880 --> 19:36.960
Can you give me a little bit more detail about what, what do you mean when you

19:36.960 --> 19:42.800
save voice bot? What is the envision functionality of this voice bot? I will

19:42.800 --> 19:50.800
show the pitch from the startup at the summit. But to summarize, it's really in

19:50.800 --> 19:55.920
real-time conversation between the clients and the relationship manager. The

19:55.920 --> 20:02.280
conversation would be listened through NLB. It will be processed. We will

20:02.280 --> 20:09.520
detect the intense of the clients. Compute a reply. Not a reply that we will

20:09.520 --> 20:15.480
give to the clients, but a reply that will be displayed on the workstation of

20:15.480 --> 20:22.160
their relationship manager to guide in directly. So if the client says, I need to

20:22.160 --> 20:30.040
do a transfer. If I simplify on the screen in real-time, there will be, let's say,

20:30.040 --> 20:35.440
the summary of the transaction requests and the button for the relationship

20:35.440 --> 20:41.440
manager to execute. If the client is asking questions around a product or

20:41.440 --> 20:49.600
something very specific in terms of assets, we will find a reply and give all

20:49.600 --> 20:54.680
the information elements directly to the relationship manager. So, and of

20:54.680 --> 21:02.040
course, when you are doing transaction remotely with clients, we have to

21:02.040 --> 21:08.440
follow many rules for the regulators and the legal context and the

21:08.440 --> 21:13.720
discussion will be listened and let's say highlights and guidance will be

21:13.720 --> 21:19.000
provided to the relationship manager in real-time again on the screen. So pay

21:19.000 --> 21:23.320
attention to that. You forgot to say that and so on, so to be sure that

21:23.320 --> 21:29.320
everything goes very smoothly. And behind, with the capacity to execute what is

21:29.320 --> 21:35.440
agreed during the conversation. Okay, that's very interesting. I recently

21:35.440 --> 21:43.000
attended an event in New York that NYU Future Labs AI Summit. NYU Future

21:43.000 --> 21:48.280
Labs is a, they've got an accelerator program called AI Nexus Lab that's

21:48.280 --> 21:54.080
incubates AI startups and one of the startups and I actually did a podcast with

21:54.080 --> 21:59.400
them that was went out a few weeks ago or so a couple of weeks ago. There's a

21:59.400 --> 22:03.200
company called Second Mind and I think they're doing just what you're

22:03.200 --> 22:09.160
describing. They, you kind of transient listening to a conversation and then

22:09.160 --> 22:14.480
it's almost like the old screen pop from a, you know, a call center type of

22:14.480 --> 22:19.080
workstation where it's, in their case, the demo that they showed, you know, you

22:19.080 --> 22:23.320
could be talking about, you could talk about general topics and it would push

22:23.320 --> 22:29.280
the agent, you know, Wikipedia articles or directions, Google maps, things

22:29.280 --> 22:33.600
like that. But, you know, there, I think the market that they're going after is

22:33.600 --> 22:38.360
just the one that you're describing with this voice spot where you would be

22:38.360 --> 22:43.840
tying it into business systems and really, I guess what I'm interpreting

22:43.840 --> 22:49.680
here is kind of the next evolution of almost call center, you know, software that

22:49.680 --> 22:54.800
is kind of guiding someone through a conversation, but here you're trying to

22:54.800 --> 23:00.120
kind of augment the resources that they have it, or augment their ability to

23:00.120 --> 23:04.400
access, you know, a broad set of resources, you know, while still trying to help

23:04.400 --> 23:10.720
them kind of guide the conversation towards some set of goals. Yeah, exactly, and

23:10.720 --> 23:17.440
at the same time, as we display information to the relationship manager, the way

23:17.440 --> 23:23.560
he will use them will give the feedback group to the artificial intelligence,

23:23.560 --> 23:29.320
and the system must become more and more accurate, and there's really the

23:29.320 --> 23:33.920
feedback group to enrich the system. So it's pretty powerful. How do you think

23:33.920 --> 23:39.360
this changes the relationship between those relationship managers and their

23:39.360 --> 23:45.240
clients or more broadly the bank and the clients? So again, our objective is

23:45.240 --> 23:51.280
really to deliver the best quality to the clients, the best added value to the

23:51.280 --> 24:00.160
accrued shop on the request it could have, and so on very fast. So many topics

24:00.160 --> 24:07.640
to be addressed. So basically the relation between the client and his relationship

24:07.640 --> 24:14.960
manager will not change. So they will still discuss and so on. It's just that we

24:14.960 --> 24:21.360
will have a relationship manager to be faster, more accurate, have a broad

24:21.360 --> 24:27.160
vision on everything that could influence his discussion with the client. He has

24:27.160 --> 24:33.280
right now on the phone without any preparation. So that's really what is

24:33.280 --> 24:37.840
very interesting in that area with artificial intelligence. What have been some

24:37.840 --> 24:44.680
of the, what can you describe, some of the technology involved in the way you've

24:44.680 --> 24:48.720
implemented this and maybe some of the challenges that you've run into? I

24:48.720 --> 24:56.160
must say that NLB is the door to door for us. Let's say Kias said that we need, I've

24:56.160 --> 25:01.360
been really impressed by the start of the Winstead Yakuton session Singapore

25:01.360 --> 25:08.480
because they have developed their own NLB processing. And I must say that I've

25:08.480 --> 25:15.440
been amazed by the accuracy that they can reach the capacity of learning from

25:15.440 --> 25:21.360
the system to adapt to the different accent, different languages, and really

25:21.360 --> 25:27.840
their capacity to in final, they say have a kind of personal NLP

25:27.840 --> 25:36.240
client. So as you can hear, I'm not English native. So I have an accent which

25:36.240 --> 25:42.000
of course could impact the way the artificial intelligence can understand me

25:42.000 --> 25:48.240
when I'm speaking. And the way they manage that, they can really adapt the

25:48.240 --> 25:54.400
understanding really on the very personal base. So they will even a real

25:54.400 --> 25:59.200
French with a heavy French accent in English, will still be understood by the

25:59.200 --> 26:04.080
system. So that's really something very important

26:04.080 --> 26:11.440
because we need accuracy to detect the intents from the clients and then the

26:11.440 --> 26:17.200
artificial intelligence part who pays from the intent find the best

26:17.200 --> 26:23.040
reply to display to the relationship manager and have the learning capacity

26:23.040 --> 26:30.000
with the feedback is the final, let's say a module that we need.

26:30.000 --> 26:35.280
And behind that's all the topics to get access to all the data that we have

26:35.280 --> 26:41.120
inside the bank to really take the most because artificial intelligence

26:41.120 --> 26:48.480
without perfect input is kind of empty brain. You have to

26:48.480 --> 26:55.440
to feed that and data is really crucial. Luckily, as a bank, we have a lot of

26:55.440 --> 27:00.960
data to share with that. So we can really put a lot inside the brain.

27:00.960 --> 27:06.560
And then it's a question to, let's say, to make the way of thinking,

27:06.560 --> 27:09.760
really fitting the targets we are following.

27:09.760 --> 27:15.200
When you describe this startup in Singapore, is this an internal

27:15.200 --> 27:21.200
startup that I envision this as an internal hackathon and this

27:21.200 --> 27:26.720
startup were bank employees or is it an external startup company?

27:26.720 --> 27:33.040
No, it was a real hackathon with external startups with a set of

27:33.040 --> 27:41.200
startups which were from the very young startups to the ones which are already

27:41.200 --> 27:47.200
known on the market and more mature. So it was a full-fledged hackathon.

27:47.200 --> 27:51.840
Oh, got it, got it. And is this what's this startup called?

27:51.840 --> 27:57.600
So it's a Korean startup named Kudadjust, very young startup,

27:57.600 --> 28:03.600
very promising. Okay. And do you have a sense for

28:03.600 --> 28:09.120
some of the technologies, you know, the technology decisions that they've had

28:09.120 --> 28:14.320
to make and building out this platform? And, you know, maybe some,

28:14.320 --> 28:18.320
you know, I guess one of the questions that comes up frequently for me

28:18.320 --> 28:23.280
in talking about chat bots and voice bots and the like is whether they're

28:23.280 --> 28:27.200
building on top of some existing, you know, third-party

28:27.200 --> 28:31.280
software or whether they've built it all from scratch and what some of the

28:31.280 --> 28:36.560
trade-offs there are. Kudadjust is a mix. So they have developed their own

28:36.560 --> 28:42.480
NLP and their own artificial intelligence engine. And then they extend

28:42.480 --> 28:47.440
some of the capacities by using, let's say, other solutions.

28:47.440 --> 28:52.000
I'm really sorry, I could not name those solutions because it's really

28:52.000 --> 28:58.960
added the periphery from that. But they are really, they their own

28:58.960 --> 29:03.360
their own technology. That makes them pretty interesting.

29:03.360 --> 29:09.520
If, yeah, perhaps I should not say that, but if our topic was to make

29:09.520 --> 29:14.640
Alexa like all the others, it's still interesting, of course.

29:14.640 --> 29:19.440
Nevertheless, it's like the others. And we have a strong belief that there are

29:19.440 --> 29:23.200
opportunities to really be different on the market for

29:23.200 --> 29:27.280
wealth management at the best, of course, for the clients, but

29:27.280 --> 29:30.960
really to take the most from those opportunities

29:30.960 --> 29:38.000
is not by copying what everyone is doing or at least not all the time.

29:38.000 --> 29:45.440
In that area, to explore at best, yeah, we don't have to to follow all the time

29:45.440 --> 29:49.120
what the others are doing. Right. Are there other

29:49.120 --> 29:54.640
opportunities on your roadmap that you can speak to and how you

29:54.640 --> 30:00.000
further apply AI to wealth management? Yeah, I can also speak about

30:00.000 --> 30:05.680
big data. So not on, let's say, how to manage big data with

30:05.680 --> 30:10.720
that do for other technologies, but really how to take the most from all those

30:10.720 --> 30:17.200
information in the best way. And on that, we have again, with a startup

30:17.200 --> 30:23.200
this time in Paris, we have worked on a proof of concept and we are now working

30:23.200 --> 30:30.480
on the MVP itself to really use capacity based on artificial intelligence,

30:30.480 --> 30:34.960
which supports the way that the data scientists and

30:34.960 --> 30:41.760
data analysts or classical ones are exploring the data to find the path

30:41.760 --> 30:48.080
they are looking for. For example, to detect a based on model that

30:48.080 --> 30:54.640
we can after apply to many clients, why that client is more interested in

30:54.640 --> 31:00.400
advisory while another is more execution only or any other question that we

31:00.400 --> 31:06.080
can have, hot topics like attrition, client retention,

31:06.080 --> 31:11.600
to really dig into the data in a very deep manner.

31:11.600 --> 31:16.800
Unit tools and artificial intelligence is really a very interesting area to

31:16.800 --> 31:21.920
support that. Okay. And what's that company? So that one

31:21.920 --> 31:28.640
was a DreamCraft. It's more about the neural all approach on the data

31:28.640 --> 31:34.160
to connect all the different topics that you could export to to find

31:34.160 --> 31:39.360
really the common bad about specific behavior that you would like to

31:39.360 --> 31:42.560
analyze. And you said what kind of approach?

31:42.560 --> 31:49.600
No, no. Is it French? French, perhaps? No, it's

31:49.600 --> 31:54.320
Neuron? Neuron? Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sorry.

31:54.320 --> 31:59.200
No, no, no, no, French. I wouldn't want to have to do the

31:59.200 --> 32:01.680
the entire interview in French. So

32:04.640 --> 32:11.840
Okay, so they're helping, they've got some technology that you can apply to,

32:11.840 --> 32:15.280
it sounds like the, you know, your various data lakes and

32:15.280 --> 32:19.920
and big data repositories that helps you better kind of understand

32:19.920 --> 32:23.440
that uses AI to help you better understand what

32:23.440 --> 32:28.560
information assets are within those environments and

32:28.560 --> 32:34.880
maybe help you understand how to best use them. Yeah, that's the idea.

32:34.880 --> 32:39.760
So the way they manage that as well, they are not on the

32:39.760 --> 32:44.320
let's say the data lake and big data technology itself. It's really the way

32:44.320 --> 32:49.840
they analyze the data and the way they translate that into

32:49.840 --> 32:56.160
let's say factors and items that can be understood by

32:56.160 --> 33:01.200
common marketers. Right. I hope that there will be not too many

33:01.200 --> 33:05.040
marketers listen to me because they will hate me, but yeah,

33:05.040 --> 33:10.560
data can be so complex that you have really to find a way to

33:10.560 --> 33:16.640
represent that clearly. So what are the main factors which

33:16.640 --> 33:21.280
influence the results and that part is based on the artificial

33:21.280 --> 33:25.920
intelligence inside Dreamcork and it's pretty efficient so

33:25.920 --> 33:31.200
it's very interesting to explore. Okay, it sounds like a really

33:31.200 --> 33:36.400
interesting area in the early days of data lakes. There was a lot

33:36.400 --> 33:42.480
of a lot of the effort went into like trying to manually create

33:42.480 --> 33:48.640
these data catalogs that would help a marketer or a line of

33:48.640 --> 33:52.400
business person understand what data is available to them. But

33:52.400 --> 33:58.080
there's just so much data. It seems like applying AI to that

33:58.080 --> 34:03.440
problem of keeping that data catalog up to date and even

34:03.440 --> 34:08.080
automatically making recommending insights that could come

34:08.080 --> 34:12.080
from the data that you have is an interesting opportunity

34:12.080 --> 34:17.280
for a large organization. Yeah, exactly. And also,

34:17.280 --> 34:22.880
surprisingly, you also learn about the quality of your data.

34:22.880 --> 34:28.560
But it's a different story. We have been very surprised that

34:28.560 --> 34:33.760
for some exploration, we made one of the main factor was

34:33.760 --> 34:38.560
being male or female, which was on that topic totally

34:38.560 --> 34:43.760
kind of nonsense. Yeah, yeah. And in fact, we have seen that

34:43.760 --> 34:49.200
there was a mistake somewhere and in fact for many many

34:49.200 --> 34:53.600
clients, we did not have the information if it was a

34:53.600 --> 34:59.600
madam or a sir and so on. And then so we we have corrected that.

34:59.600 --> 35:04.000
So we have, of course, the information in one of our system,

35:04.000 --> 35:08.560
but the way the data lake was feed, there was a mistake and

35:08.560 --> 35:13.120
that information was sometimes lost. So we improved the

35:13.120 --> 35:17.520
quality of the data lake by working with the solution.

35:17.520 --> 35:20.960
So was the just to make sure I understand the issue here was

35:20.960 --> 35:28.080
the issue that gender was in fact very predictive, but you

35:28.080 --> 35:34.720
didn't have that data for a lot of your records or that you

35:34.720 --> 35:39.200
you ran some analysis and found that gender, you know, was

35:39.200 --> 35:42.080
predictive, but it really shouldn't have been. And it was,

35:42.080 --> 35:44.240
you know, there was really something else going on that you

35:44.240 --> 35:48.480
had to identify. Exactly. It's a the the fact that the

35:48.480 --> 35:53.760
gender was a was very important in the result was just a

35:53.760 --> 35:58.720
nonsense. Yeah. And so what was the underlying issue?

35:58.720 --> 36:03.360
Was it was gender correlated with something else that,

36:03.360 --> 36:07.120
you know, or was, you know, just something very very broken in

36:07.120 --> 36:10.880
the process. So it was broken in the process so that that's

36:10.880 --> 36:16.240
the reason why I meant that equality. Because in fact, let's say

36:16.240 --> 36:21.600
we had a kind of bug in the process to feed the data lake,

36:21.600 --> 36:26.800
which made that for many clients, the gender was not

36:26.800 --> 36:31.360
filled in fact. So it was in the, let's say, the the main

36:31.360 --> 36:37.040
systems, but when we take the data to put that in the data lake

36:37.040 --> 36:41.200
something happened that the gender was just disappearing

36:41.200 --> 36:46.320
for 40% of the clients. Oh, wow. Okay. So based on that, we

36:46.320 --> 36:50.560
we have found that that issue we have corrected it of

36:50.560 --> 36:55.040
groups. And then the model made more sense because suddenly

36:55.040 --> 37:00.000
gender was not a factor anymore. Okay, make sense.

37:00.000 --> 37:05.840
Well, Terry, can you maybe help us wind things up? Do you have any

37:05.840 --> 37:10.560
advice that you give to that you'd give to other, you know,

37:10.560 --> 37:14.640
either, you know, CDOs at other organizations that are trying

37:14.640 --> 37:21.200
to figure out how to fit AI into their portfolio or perhaps even

37:21.200 --> 37:24.880
to, you know, companies that want to work with organizations

37:24.880 --> 37:28.880
like yours in terms of, you know, the types of things you need

37:28.880 --> 37:32.640
or things you're looking for. If I have some some advice,

37:32.640 --> 37:37.520
it's really to focus on the use case. Always great advice.

37:37.520 --> 37:43.520
Yes, really do not start with the technology business will must be

37:43.520 --> 37:48.320
really in the driving seat based on a business use case to

37:48.320 --> 37:53.520
achieve. Otherwise, you will, you will be lost in the topic.

37:53.520 --> 37:57.920
It's too wide. It's too complex. It's very often too new.

37:57.920 --> 38:02.240
So it must be very pragmatic. I want to achieve that in terms of

38:02.240 --> 38:08.400
business. And then just in brackets, just a question to find the right

38:08.400 --> 38:12.960
technology or the right partners to drive there. Second advice,

38:12.960 --> 38:16.960
if you are not working on artificial intelligence, well,

38:16.960 --> 38:22.400
you should, because yeah, especially for the banks, but for many

38:22.400 --> 38:28.640
other companies, there is a strong war against cost to be more

38:28.640 --> 38:33.120
efficient, more accurate, deliver the best quality,

38:33.120 --> 38:37.520
at the best price and so on. So yeah, artificial intelligence

38:37.520 --> 38:42.400
is a for sure part of the reply. So you have to work on that.

38:42.400 --> 38:47.440
It's about your future for your company and all the business that you could

38:47.440 --> 38:54.320
do for sure. And I think, yeah, that's my two best advice I could give.

38:54.320 --> 38:59.760
Now, perhaps the third one, yeah, baby steps. Don't try to put

38:59.760 --> 39:03.680
artificial intelligence for the whole company in one's experiments

39:03.680 --> 39:09.040
learn, because there is a lot to learn. And artificial intelligence

39:09.040 --> 39:16.720
area is totally different from what you usually manage in terms of technologies.

39:16.720 --> 39:23.360
So the best approach is really to try, fail, try again, adapt and so on.

39:23.360 --> 39:28.880
So experiment is, yeah, one of the best advice I can give also.

39:28.880 --> 39:33.680
