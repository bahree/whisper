00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,880
people doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,440
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,400
Once again, let's start the show by sending some love out to you, the listeners for your

12
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,040
Speaking of community, please take note, the next Twimble online meetup is coming up soon.

13
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,920
On Tuesday, November 14th, at 3pm Pacific time, we'll be joined by Kevin T, who will be

14
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:21,040
presenting his paper, active preference learning for personalized portfolio construction.

15
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,040
If you've already registered for the meetup, you should have received an invitation with

16
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,680
all the details.

17
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:32,640
If you still need to sign up, just head on over to Twimoleia.com slash meetup to do so.

18
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,240
We hope to see you there.

19
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,400
Now as you may know, a few weeks ago we spent some time in New York City hosted by our

20
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,520
friends at NYU Future Labs.

21
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,120
About six months ago, we covered their inaugural AI Summit, an event they hosted to showcase

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,320
the startups in their first batch of their AI Nexus Lab Accelerator program, as well

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,920
as the impressive AI talent in the New York City ecosystem.

24
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,640
Well, this time we had the pleasure of interviewing the four startups from the second AI Nexus

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,160
Lab batch, Mount Clevverist, Bite AI, Second Mind, and Bowtie Labs.

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,120
We also interviewed some of the great speakers from the event, and we're presenting a couple

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,120
of those interviews to you this week.

28
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,440
If you missed any of the shows in the series, visit Twimoleia.com slash AI Nexus Lab 2 to

29
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,000
get caught up.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,160
In this episode, I speak with Ross Fadley, a New York-based AI Lee with Insight Data Science.

31
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,840
Insight is a really interesting company offering a free seven week postdoctoral training fellowship,

32
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,200
helping individuals to bridge the gap between academia and careers in data science, data

33
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,840
engineering, and AI.

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,040
Ross joined me backstage at the Future Lab Summit after leading a machine learning primer

35
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,840
for attendees.

36
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,800
Our conversation explores some of the knowledge gaps that Insight has identified in folks

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,520
coming out of academia, and how they structured their program to address them.

38
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:01,480
If you find yourself looking to make this transition, you'll definitely want to check

39
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,120
out this episode.

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:13,040
And now onto the show.

41
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,520
Alright everyone, I am backstage at the NYU Skurball Center, where the Future Lab Group

42
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:25,760
is holding the AI Summit, and I am here with Ross Fadley, who is the AI lead at Insight

43
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,760
Data.

44
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,800
Ross, welcome to this weekend machine learning and AI.

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,560
Hi, pleasure to be here.

46
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,600
It's great to have you on the show.

47
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,840
Why don't we get started by having you tell me a little bit about your background and

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,480
how you got interested and involved in AI?

49
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
Sure.

50
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,040
So I have a background in physics, actually.

51
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,200
So when I was in undergrad, I was really passionate about physics, and ended up going and

52
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,680
do a PhD focusing on astrophysics.

53
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
Okay.

54
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:54,800
And that time really drove me to understand and appreciate data.

55
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:00,600
So during that I was really focused on doing Bayesian machine learning because we had relatively

56
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,640
small amounts of data, but we needed to quantify the uncertainty of our models.

57
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,520
And so that I kind of just got forced into because of how I went down my academic path,

58
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,760
but it made me really excited by what was happening in machine learning and some of the

59
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,360
new emerging technologies on that front.

60
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,360
Awesome.

61
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:23,200
I have talked to a ton of folks who came into machine learning and AI by way of physics.

62
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,200
Yeah.

63
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,080
And one of the interesting things that happened when I was a postdoc, most recently at NYU,

64
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,560
I was jointly appointed with the computer science group with Rob Fergis, who won the

65
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,040
image net competition while I was there working with him.

66
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,120
And so it was like a really neat opportunity to apply some of these emerging AI like deep

67
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,320
learning models in the context of astronomy, which was really exciting times.

68
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Oh nice.

69
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,440
And how did he win that before after Matt Zeeler?

70
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,920
Oh, he won it with him.

71
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
A with?

72
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,920
Yeah.

73
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,920
Okay.

74
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
Okay.

75
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,920
So this is our second year here at the Future Lab Summit.

76
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,600
And last year, I keep saying year.

77
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,080
And Steve keeps saying year on stage, it was actually only six months ago.

78
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,720
But so the second time here, and last time I got to interview Matt and hear a little bit

79
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,920
about his story.

80
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,720
So you are in the same group.

81
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,720
Yeah.

82
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,760
So Matt was a PhD student with Rob while I was Rob's postdoc.

83
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,760
Okay.

84
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,280
It was interesting because I was jointly appointed with the physics group.

85
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,600
And so we were doing a little bit of crosstalk in terms of like bringing some computer science

86
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,040
applications to astronomy, but also leveraging some astrophysical knowledge when we're applying

87
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,040
some of these techniques.

88
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,040
Okay.

89
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,040
Awesome.

90
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
And now insight data.

91
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,040
What does insight data do?

92
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,520
So insight is a professional education company.

93
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,520
Okay.

94
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,240
We run free seven week fellowship programs to help people transition into careers in data.

95
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,240
Oh wow.

96
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
Yeah.

97
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,240
Specifically, it's focused around.

98
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,240
Did you just say free?

99
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,240
Yeah.

100
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,240
That's amazing.

101
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,240
So free to the fellows.

102
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,840
Historically, it came out of the fact that like, there were really smart people in academia.

103
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,600
And companies needed like data scientists, but didn't know how to find them.

104
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
Yeah.

105
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,880
But like these smart people were there and they didn't know how to connect.

106
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,600
So our founder, Jake Clampka, realized that there is this mismatch and formed the company.

107
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:11,200
But of course, academics aren't, you know, able to pay a fee for education because they're

108
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,880
usually pretty, you know, strapped for cash.

109
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,040
So we find it really important to like make these free for the fellows and the company's

110
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,680
sponsor of the program basically.

111
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,680
Okay.

112
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,440
And what is the typical fellow profile?

113
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,320
It depends on the program. So in data science, it's typically a PhD in a quantitative field.

114
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,160
So it does span traditional backgrounds like physics, math, computer science.

115
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,920
But it also spans into, you know, biological sciences, even things like political science

116
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,200
and linguistics, kind of a mix.

117
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,320
So that's our data science program.

118
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,800
But we also run a data engineering program, a health data program.

119
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,200
And I'm in charge of the AI program that we run here in New York.

120
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Okay.

121
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,480
AI program and the data science program are distinct.

122
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Yeah.

123
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,480
That's correct.

124
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,000
So the AI program is a little bit different in terms of backgrounds because we see this

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,960
mismatch of what people want in the industry and where people are coming from.

126
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,920
So often people in industry are looking for two broad buckets.

127
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
One is like the AI engineer.

128
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,560
So someone who has extreme engineering talent, maybe knows the machine learning parts quite

129
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,400
well, but maybe not to the same degree that someone who's been doing research for a long

130
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
time.

131
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Right.

132
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:28,880
And so the AI is the idea that the AI program accommodates both this machine learning engineer

133
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:35,360
and someone who's more traditionally like a data scientist, but focused on AI or that

134
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,560
the data scientist goes through the data science program and the AI program kind of fills

135
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,120
the rest of the need for this around this engineering role.

136
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Yeah.

137
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
No, it's more of the former.

138
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,120
So we do see.

139
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
I thought for sure I was wrong as I was.

140
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,400
Well, you nailed it quite right, actually, because like some of these deep learning models

141
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,120
are quite specific, quite new and really cutting edge, the AI program tries to bring in people

142
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,880
from that group of research into the program, which is not necessarily true for data science

143
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,880
more generally.

144
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,880
Okay.

145
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,880
Got it.

146
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:15,560
And so the program is kind of like this, you know, farm team feeder program kind of things

147
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,280
specifically for academics that's not like your typical coding boot camp or something

148
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,800
like that, where you're taking people off the street and training them up.

149
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:30,240
So we actually do admit people from industry, but only for our currently at least for our

150
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,280
data engineering and AI programs, again, on this engineering front for AI, for instance,

151
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,960
some of the best engineers are people in industry.

152
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,440
We've had people from teams like Google, LinkedIn, Salesforce, top engineers who want to move

153
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,000
more into AI come through our programs.

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Okay.

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh, wow.

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,600
And so you talked a little bit about it.

157
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:57,120
Some of the missing, the things that the industry is looking for that are missing at like

158
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
a really high level.

159
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,160
Can you go a little bit more deep on that like what?

160
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,640
What are the things that you're really trying to teach these folks as they come through

161
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
the program?

162
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:13,040
Well, often the people who are coming into our program have like 95 to 99% of the technical

163
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
skills you need.

164
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,600
So they often come in with an experience say deep in computer vision and are well suited

165
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,240
for those types of roles, but they don't know like the trade-offs and how people are actually

166
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,200
using this in practice on real teams.

167
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,680
And so one of the things we do is to help give them this idea of not only like scoping

168
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,480
and appropriately like doing a project that speaks to the type of work that they're going

169
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,600
to be doing in industry, but we bring in top mentors from teams who tell them about the

170
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,200
work they're doing, help them understand what's like the most important thing and what

171
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,640
are the critical challenges they're currently facing.

172
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,480
And that sort of information is something that you it's really hard to get isolated on

173
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,760
your own in a black box.

174
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:02,120
And is it like project oriented or is it more traditional just you know model by model

175
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,440
or field by field?

176
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,920
Yeah, we find it's really important to not have like coursework or book work.

177
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:15,080
It's all project oriented so the fellows execute a significant like data science, data engineering,

178
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:19,680
AI projects during their time at insight and it's done in a collaborative way.

179
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,800
So it's a very collaborative environment.

180
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,640
It's full time so everyone's together in a room, super smart people and they leverage

181
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,840
off each other's knowledge because one person might be a deep expert in NLP.

182
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:35,040
The other one may know nothing about it when they start talking they learn much more

183
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,480
rapidly than if you they were told to like go off in a corner and read a book.

184
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,640
And how many people in a given cohort?

185
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,720
So there's roughly about 30 people in each cohort.

186
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,520
We're currently in four cities and we run those three times a year.

187
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,920
So that's gives you a little bit of a scale there.

188
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,920
What cities?

189
00:10:52,920 --> 00:11:00,040
So we started out in Palo Alto in 2012, are in New York, Boston and Seattle and we also run

190
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040
a remote program.

191
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,520
I could have guessed those right.

192
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:10,120
And are you expanding more cities or are you adding more programs like what's the expansion

193
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
plan if any?

194
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,640
Yeah, that's a great question.

195
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,560
So to give you a little understanding of our previous expansion, we kicked off New

196
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,880
York in 2014, along with a new program in data engineering.

197
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,040
So we started just data science.

198
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,160
We then launched Boston focused on health data.

199
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,600
That was also in 2014 I believe.

200
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,440
And then most recently Seattle and data science.

201
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,800
This last year was our first launch of the AI program, which started off in Palo Alto,

202
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,360
ran for the first time in New York over the summer.

203
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,760
So that's like our historical growth.

204
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,120
We're planning to move into new cities in the coming future, possibly in international

205
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:52,160
locations and thinking heavily about new programs as they come up in industry.

206
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,040
The goal really is like to live on this edge of the mismatch between what companies need

207
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,240
and are struggling to find good people in and where there's a gap in terms of talent

208
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,360
and how can we bridge that gap?

209
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,240
It strikes me that it's, it strikes me that you have to address some of these challenges

210
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,640
and this kind of impedance mismatch via projects.

211
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:19,360
But also it's challenging to do so because you don't know what you don't know kind of

212
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
problem, right?

213
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,320
And so how do you supplement the project work with, you know, the things that they need

214
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,400
to know or is it just, you know, go bang your head against the wall and figure it out

215
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,360
and when you finally figure out what you don't know, we'll be here to answer the question

216
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
for you.

217
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Yeah.

218
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,720
So as program directors, as the people who run these programs, their job is to ensure

219
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,880
that they have the resources to overcome technical hurdles as they approach them.

220
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:50,320
We encourage them to first dive into it and hit the walls themselves, but then just

221
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,360
basically give them the right tools and guidance to overcome those technical hurdles.

222
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,320
Some of that might become, come from us, like as people who run the programs, but we have

223
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,600
over 1200 people who have gone through our programs currently and they come back and

224
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,160
regularly mentor the people in the program, not only on the technical front, but also

225
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,160
like what is it like to be a data scientist at X company and so on?

226
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,320
Very cool.

227
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,800
And so is the program run as a single project, kind of like a capstone thing or is it a

228
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,000
series of smaller projects?

229
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah, it is just a single project because we want it to have a significant amount of

230
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,720
depth that it's like, impressive to see what someone can actually accomplish in just three

231
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,320
or four weeks' time.

232
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,960
Later on, the program, the fellows are going around and presenting this work as a way

233
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,600
to warm start the interview process with companies that are interested in meaning, sure.

234
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:49,000
And are the projects things that they work on individually or in as part of teams, understanding

235
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,440
that there's collaboration and people helping each other, but do I, you know, are folks

236
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,480
grouped into smaller teams to work on things?

237
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,320
Yeah, it's really individual based because ultimately these people are hoping to launch

238
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,800
their new career and when they're going to meet a new hiring manager and having some

239
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,480
of their first interviews, being able to talk about something they concretely did and

240
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,400
not having mixed signals of who did what, it's really important.

241
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
Okay.

242
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,080
I guess I was wondering if, you know, if you had any startups come out of this, like if

243
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:22,520
someone, you know, if teams, I guess, or maybe if individuals, like, puts, built something

244
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,680
as part of this program and decided, well, you know, forget industry, I'm going to, well,

245
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:30,840
forget a job, I'm going to start a company around this thing that I did.

246
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,720
Yeah, there's been a few examples of that.

247
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:39,200
We're seeing more of it sort of come about, especially with the AI program in particular,

248
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,920
because there's a new sort of green space that's being created around AI startups.

249
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,640
And so we're working closely with fellows who are interested in launching these new

250
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,160
initiatives, as well as ones who want something like a more traditional path.

251
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Okay.

252
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,320
And so if you could give a list of folks who, or if you could give folks who, you know,

253
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,560
are similarly situated in academia or have, you know, strong backgrounds in the theory

254
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,840
of machine learning and AI, but not the practical experience, if you can give those folks a list

255
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:20,000
of, you know, you tell me how long, one, three, five, ten things to go, you know, figure

256
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:26,720
out or learn about in lieu of an experience like insight, like what's on that list?

257
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,640
Often for people, especially in pure academics, a little bit about tooling, so some of them

258
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:38,400
might be using a language like MATLAB or R or other languages that maybe aren't sort

259
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,440
of industry standard, making sure that you have the tooling to do that.

260
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,040
Secondly is sort of like the techniques.

261
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,360
Often when you're doing a PhD, you get a book learning of, you know, the broad landscape

262
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,800
of, you know, machine learning, deep learning, and then you dive deeply on one specific model.

263
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,640
But often when you're on these teams, you want to be able to speak to more broad topics.

264
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,280
So not just knowing one type of NLP, but knowing the broad spectrum in a more deep way.

265
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,440
And so the way you might be able to do that is to actually take on concrete projects

266
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,960
with not just clean data sets that come from like Kaggle or some machine learning depository,

267
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:21,920
but actually real live data that either you scraped or you've gotten from like a messy

268
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,160
dump of data and dealing with those problems that come up when you're trying to implement

269
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,080
something that's more realistic that companies have to deal with.

270
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Okay.

271
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:35,880
So two things, anything, and that's consistent with, so yesterday I was interviewing the

272
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:42,720
startups that are part of the AI Nexus lab and I asked them all like what are the biggest

273
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,840
challenges they're experiencing and your latter point dealing with, you know, acquiring

274
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:54,080
and annotating and generally dealing with messy data is was universally like the number

275
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:57,800
one challenge that they face and sounds like it's not just startups.

276
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,600
It's that's what industry folks are telling you as well and anything else beyond those

277
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,600
two.

278
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:08,800
I think a lot of it too is like knowing how data fits in terms of strategy for an organization.

279
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,000
I think a lot of people who are academics think, oh, you just go and do your machine learning

280
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,200
model and check that box.

281
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,800
But in fact, like being able to evaluate how core to the company's mission where work

282
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,120
is and what opportunities you're going to have is a very challenging space and often

283
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,520
it'll affect how happy you are, how will you fit into a particular job.

284
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,680
So on that front, it's more about getting out, trying to find ways to network and learn

285
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:38,160
more about, learn more from people in industry and get a sense of like what does it mean

286
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:44,160
to be at a big enterprise company who's focused on NLP versus a startup that's doing computer

287
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
vision stuff.

288
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,920
Those are broadly different motivations and problems that those, those organizations

289
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
have.

290
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
Awesome.

291
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,400
Well, what's next for insight?

292
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,080
We talked a little bit about expansion, but any other, you know, programs or things

293
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,840
that you'd want folks to know about?

294
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,840
Yeah, we're currently thinking of ways that we might be able to work more closely with

295
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:08,800
some of the teams that we work with, specifically around like helping them overcome technical

296
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:14,320
hurdles because the depth of technical knowledge on our teams is quite strong and we do a lot

297
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,480
of like in-house research in order to stay on top of the type of work that our fellows

298
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
are doing.

299
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
Okay.

300
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Interesting.

301
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,320
How big is that research team?

302
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,480
Well, so everyone's sort of like all the technical team members at insight do their own like

303
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,360
either projects or keeping up with the latest journals.

304
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,440
So it's not like a strongly unified team.

305
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,440
It's more like everyone knows that they want it and they're excited to do it because frankly

306
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,320
almost all the technical team members were people who went through the program.

307
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,360
And so they themselves are very excited by this type of work and are eager to do it.

308
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Okay.

309
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,360
Awesome.

310
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,720
And work and folks learn more and like what's the, is there a link to the application or

311
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,240
you know, what's the process for folks that are interested?

312
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
Yeah.

313
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,760
You can find all the information on our website insight data science.com.

314
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,080
There's links to all of our programs including the white papers, which actually do a really

315
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:13,080
great job of like laying out what is the difference between data science, what is the difference

316
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,720
between data engineering, what is the difference between AI and all those things.

317
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Right.

318
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,000
And a lot of people, especially from academia and other places like that is a hard thing

319
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,640
to parse and it's still like kind of a hard thing to parse for a lot of people in general.

320
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,640
Right.

321
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,560
So great information there, including our blog posts, which give you a sense of like the

322
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,240
type of work fellows do.

323
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,240
Okay.

324
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,320
And then the applications, we run these programs roughly three times a year.

325
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,040
They can go to the apply page, simple web form.

326
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:41,160
And then there's next steps if the application seems like it's good fit.

327
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Cool.

328
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,080
That sounds like an amazing opportunity for folks.

329
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,080
