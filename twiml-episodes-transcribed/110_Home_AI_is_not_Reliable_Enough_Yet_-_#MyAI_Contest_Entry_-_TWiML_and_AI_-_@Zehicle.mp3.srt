00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
So, hello. We want to be the AI cramudgeon, at least the personal AI cramudgeon. You know,

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:14,400
when I think about what AI could be in the promise that we have for home automation,

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,760
this personal assistance, they're just not there. I've been disappointed in voice, I've

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,800
been disappointed in a lot of my interactions where we're trying to have real artificial

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,720
intelligence to something that reads my calendar and makes recommendations or I interact

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,960
with a robot to calendar something. These lots of you desired and the idea that I have

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,120
to double check and triple check or type and re-type makes me pretty frustrated to interact

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,760
with AI's right now. So, we have a long way to go. The promise is there. There is absolutely

9
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,720
no doubt that we should be using much deeper computer systems to anticipate newer

10
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:02,320
behaviors and help us interact with technology and ways that are actually to humans very,

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,120
very predictable. So, the potential is there. It seems like it should be a solvable problem,

12
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:14,440
but from a personal perspective, it also feels farther off than I would like. At the same

13
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,960
time, I think we're using deep learning and machine learning in incredible ways in a

14
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,800
corporate setting where you have people with deep experience and masters and doctorate

15
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:29,240
degrees in these technologies, applying these technologies, mining our personal data.

16
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,920
And so, when I think about some of the stuff I'm excited as a technologist and a little

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:40,680
scared as a human, not from the robot takeover, but more from not understanding the social

18
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,520
implications of where my data is going and where people are learning about my behaviors

19
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,240
and applying it to things that I don't have a lot of control over. So, I'm going to be

20
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,920
AI-commogen here and say, it's coming, but we need to think about what it means. Thanks.
