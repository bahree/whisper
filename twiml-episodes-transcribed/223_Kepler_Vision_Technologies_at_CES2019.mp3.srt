1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So what's your name?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
My name is Harov Suckman.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm the CEO and founder of Kepler Vision Technologies.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We are a spin-off company from the University of Amsterdam.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
We bring to the market body language recognition software.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Whether I tell you a story looking like this,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
or looking like this, or looking like this,

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I may be able to, I may be saying the same thing,

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
but my body tells a different story.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Many possible applications for it,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
they are sort of blindfolded looking at the market.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Because self-driving cars will need body language recognition,

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
security, but people focus on elderly care.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
We can also recognize that people are drinking or eating,

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
if people have fallen, if they are laying on the floor,

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
or laying on the couch, or laying on the bed,

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
or if people get upset, and that's what we do.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And how does it work?

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Based on post-estimation, or I think the figures

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
that look like post-emptimation.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Skeleton, combined with raw pixel data,

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
because with just a skeleton,

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
you cannot distinguish a person eating or drinking.

24
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And what's the origin of the technology?

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The technology.

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
We build it from scratch.

27
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So we use the available open source,

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
deep neural networks, but we train it with our own data.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We annotate it, we annotate the data also ourselves.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And how do you collect the data?

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
From partners.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We have potential clients that we build proof of concepts projects with.

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Okay, and is there a demo?

34
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:17,000
No.
