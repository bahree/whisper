Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

00:15.920 --> 00:20.880
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.200
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:23.200 --> 00:28.440
I'd like to start off this show by sending out a huge thank you to everyone listening.

00:28.440 --> 00:32.800
We've dropped a ton of great interviews over the past few weeks and through your dedication

00:32.800 --> 00:39.040
we continue to see a growing outpouring of feedback comments and shares with each release.

00:39.040 --> 00:43.600
If you're a regular listener but don't normally send in feedback, we'd really love to hear

00:43.600 --> 00:44.600
from you.

00:44.600 --> 00:50.520
So please head on over to Apple Podcasts or wherever you listen and leave us a review.

00:50.520 --> 00:55.760
A 5 star review is of course appreciated but what's most important is that your voice

00:55.760 --> 00:56.960
is heard.

00:56.960 --> 01:01.480
And let's us know what you like or what you feel we can improve on and it also lets

01:01.480 --> 01:06.440
those looking for a new machine learning and AI podcast know that they should join the

01:06.440 --> 01:09.120
Twimble community.

01:09.120 --> 01:15.000
Speaking of community, the details of our next Twimble online meetup have been posted.

01:15.000 --> 01:22.440
On Tuesday, November 14th at 3pm Pacific time, we'll be joined by Kevin T who will be presenting

01:22.440 --> 01:28.120
his paper, active preference learning for personalized portfolio construction.

01:28.120 --> 01:32.000
If you've already registered for the meetup, you should have received an invitation

01:32.000 --> 01:33.960
with all the details.

01:33.960 --> 01:39.840
If you still need to register, head on over to twimbleai.com slash meetup to do so.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.480
We hope to see you there.

01:41.480 --> 01:45.800
Now as some of you may know, we spent a few days last week in New York City hosted by

01:45.800 --> 01:49.120
our great friends at NYU Future Labs.

01:49.120 --> 01:53.880
About six months ago, we covered their inaugural AI Summit, an event they hosted to showcase

01:53.880 --> 01:58.920
the startups in the first batch of their AI Nexus Lab program, as well as the impressive

01:58.920 --> 02:02.040
AI talent in the New York City ecosystem.

02:02.040 --> 02:06.120
While we were more than excited when we found out they would be having a second summit

02:06.120 --> 02:11.360
so soon, this time, we had the pleasure of interviewing the four startups of the second

02:11.360 --> 02:13.480
AI Nexus Lab batch.

02:13.480 --> 02:23.800
We also interviewed a bunch of the speakers from the event and will be sharing those discussions

02:23.800 --> 02:25.920
over the upcoming weeks.

02:25.920 --> 02:32.320
In this show, I speak with Ron Fisher and Mike Wang, who, along with Vivek Siddarsen, founded

02:32.320 --> 02:38.640
Bowtie Labs, a 24-7 AI-based receptionist designed to help businesses and the beauty

02:38.640 --> 02:43.280
wellness and fitness industries increase retail conversion rates.

02:43.280 --> 02:48.040
I've talked with a few startups in the conversational space recently, and one common theme seems

02:48.040 --> 02:52.200
to be quickly outgrowing commercial conversational platforms.

02:52.200 --> 02:56.640
Ron and Mike shared their own experiences with this decision, and shared some of the challenges

02:56.640 --> 03:00.640
they're trying to overcome with their own ML models, as well as some of the techniques

03:00.640 --> 03:04.640
they use to make their system as robust and responsive as possible.

03:04.640 --> 03:18.560
All right, everyone, I am at NYU Future Labs, and I am with the co-founders of Bowtie,

03:18.560 --> 03:23.440
Ron Fisher and Mike Wang, Ron, and Mike, welcome to this weekend Machine Learning and AI.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.440
Thank you very much.

03:24.440 --> 03:25.440
Thank you.

03:25.440 --> 03:29.520
So, why don't we get started with having you, Ron, tell us a little bit about your background

03:29.520 --> 03:32.680
and how you got to get involved in Bowtie?

03:32.680 --> 03:35.560
Sure, it's definitely been a long and winding road.

03:35.560 --> 03:40.320
After college, I served in the Israeli Army for three years, basically, and did the digital

03:40.320 --> 03:44.720
strategy there and helped build out the new media, so that was definitely in my beginnings

03:44.720 --> 03:49.360
in terms of working with technology, and after that, I worked at Nielsen for five years,

03:49.360 --> 03:54.640
and then finally got my MBA Cornell Tech, where I met Mike, and my co-founder also came

03:54.640 --> 03:58.680
from Nielsen, so we had already known each other, and then the three of us formed this team

03:58.680 --> 04:03.640
as part of our final semester, where we are tasked with basically working on any problem

04:03.640 --> 04:08.280
we want, and if we want to continue that work after Spinat as a real company.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.280
Oh, wow.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.160
How about you, Mike?

04:11.160 --> 04:16.080
So I graduated from Cornell Undergrad, where I studied computer science, and that's

04:16.080 --> 04:21.280
why I really found my interest in sort of machine learning and AI in that field.

04:21.280 --> 04:26.760
And following that, I actually went directly to Cornell Tech for grad school, and that's

04:26.760 --> 04:32.800
where I met these guys, and we formed the team, and I think we have a really balanced

04:32.800 --> 04:36.880
skillset, and it's been an amazing journey so far with them.

04:36.880 --> 04:37.880
Nice.

04:37.880 --> 04:38.880
Awesome.

04:38.880 --> 04:42.560
So Bo-Tai, what does Bo-Tai do besides having an awesome robot logo sticker?

04:42.560 --> 04:43.560
So, yes.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.720
Actually, that robot has been retired.

04:45.720 --> 04:46.720
Oh, right.

04:46.720 --> 04:47.720
Yeah.

04:47.720 --> 04:48.720
Things change very quickly in a startup.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.720
It's a 24-7 AI receptionist.

04:50.720 --> 04:51.720
Okay.

04:51.720 --> 04:55.320
It's currently focused on beauty, wellness, and fitness businesses, so anything from like

04:55.320 --> 04:59.400
a high-end beauty salon to like a chain of gyms, yoga studios, things like that, and

04:59.400 --> 05:03.960
it operates on the web and through texting, and if you call any of the businesses and nobody

05:03.960 --> 05:08.760
answers, then the AI receptionist will instantly text you back, so it can convert people before

05:08.760 --> 05:11.760
they have a chance to move on to another business.

05:11.760 --> 05:12.760
Okay.

05:12.760 --> 05:13.760
So, how does that work?

05:13.760 --> 05:18.560
So, let's say like Morgan finds a cool salon on Yelp.

05:18.560 --> 05:19.560
She calls it up.

05:19.560 --> 05:20.560
Nobody answers.

05:20.560 --> 05:21.560
She's frustrated.

05:21.560 --> 05:22.560
She wants to blow up.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.400
She will now call on other business.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.400
She calls us a lot.

05:26.400 --> 05:27.400
Nobody answers.

05:27.400 --> 05:32.840
And then our AI receptionist, text her instantly, says, hey, you know, it's Lily from Bo-Tai

05:32.840 --> 05:33.840
salon.

05:33.840 --> 05:34.840
How can I help you?

05:34.840 --> 05:35.840
And then Morgan was like, oh, she just sex back.

05:35.840 --> 05:39.520
I'd love a blow out today through PM, and then they go back and forth by messaging to

05:39.520 --> 05:40.840
input the appointment.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.600
What percentage of the inbound calls are coming from mobile nowadays?

05:44.600 --> 05:47.000
Do you get a pretty high hit rate on that?

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Yeah.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.600
I would say almost all the inbound calls are coming from mobile.

05:50.600 --> 05:57.520
So I don't have an exact number, but we're able to text back with vast majority of users.

05:57.520 --> 06:01.120
Sometimes we see like someone calling for a landline, but that's actually in the low

06:01.120 --> 06:02.120
minority.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.120
Interesting.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.120
Interesting.

06:04.120 --> 06:08.240
So, I've been familiar with some kind of these appointments, casual and kind of apps.

06:08.240 --> 06:13.120
And then you have like your ex.ai, Amy kind of thing, and you guys are bringing that

06:13.120 --> 06:14.120
together.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.520
Is that a good way to think about this?

06:15.520 --> 06:16.520
Yeah.

06:16.520 --> 06:18.960
So, we're kind of like business to business to consumer.

06:18.960 --> 06:23.560
In a sense, we're giving them a tool set that they could deploy to their customer base.

06:23.560 --> 06:24.560
Okay.

06:24.560 --> 06:25.560
Interesting.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.560
And so, how does it all work?

06:27.560 --> 06:28.560
Yeah.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.560
So, great question.

06:29.560 --> 06:34.520
Well, all the texting we use Twilio for, you know, the SMS stuff.

06:34.520 --> 06:38.080
We also do a web chat, which we have our own little plugin that sits on their website.

06:38.080 --> 06:42.760
So, that's typically where customers first find out about us, or, you know, contact

06:42.760 --> 06:43.760
the bot.

06:43.760 --> 06:50.520
And what happens to Facebook Messenger, or is it a standalone bot on the page?

06:50.520 --> 06:51.520
Yeah.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.040
So, we do have Facebook Messenger as a third channel.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.600
So, we have a web chat, which typically sits on their website.

06:56.600 --> 07:01.600
You can think of like Intercom or like, as an example, what that might look like.

07:01.600 --> 07:06.080
And then SMS is where we reach out to customers who call and nobody answers.

07:06.080 --> 07:09.800
And so, those are sort of three channels that we're working in right now.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.600
And so, what happens is that when a customer sends us a message, we do two things.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.880
We extract the intent of the customer.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.440
So, like, what are they looking to do?

07:17.440 --> 07:20.480
You know, some people are looking to book an appointment right away.

07:20.480 --> 07:23.840
Other people are just looking for prices, or, you know, what time are you guys open?

07:23.840 --> 07:25.520
And so, we class by their intent.

07:25.520 --> 07:30.840
And then, we extract the entities, relevant entities in the message to figure out like,

07:30.840 --> 07:32.360
okay, who are they trying to book with?

07:32.360 --> 07:33.360
What are they trying to book?

07:33.360 --> 07:34.840
What time do they want to come in?

07:34.840 --> 07:38.640
And then, if there's anything missing, then we follow up and say, like, hey, you know,

07:38.640 --> 07:40.040
I got that you want a haircut.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.840
Did you want a men's cutter or women's cut?

07:41.840 --> 07:45.400
And who do you want it with, and when do you want to come in, and so forth?

07:45.400 --> 07:46.720
Interesting.

07:46.720 --> 07:51.760
How did you select the particular vertical that you're going after, or at least starting

07:51.760 --> 07:52.760
with?

07:52.760 --> 07:57.400
So, originally, we wanted to do, we were very passionate about chatbots, so we were talking

07:57.400 --> 07:59.520
about predictive assistance.

07:59.520 --> 08:04.320
And we knew that there were a lot of companies attacking the enterprise side of the problem.

08:04.320 --> 08:08.080
And we said that it would be really cool to do some sort of, like, self-service platform

08:08.080 --> 08:10.480
to be able to provide this, like, to businesses and mass.

08:10.480 --> 08:12.560
Similar to what Mailchip does with email.

08:12.560 --> 08:16.040
And this was before Facebook opened up the platform for Messenger, and, like, before

08:16.040 --> 08:19.360
it kind of, like, superheated up while we were still in school.

08:19.360 --> 08:23.240
So we actually originally were like, okay, well, what is a business that people interact

08:23.240 --> 08:24.240
with every day?

08:24.240 --> 08:25.240
Right.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.720
And we're like, well, what do people do every day to eat?

08:27.720 --> 08:31.440
So we started in food, because none of us have any experience really in, like, beauty

08:31.440 --> 08:32.960
on a sore fitness.

08:32.960 --> 08:38.120
And then, eventually, once we launched across, like, 25 restaurants in New York, we saw

08:38.120 --> 08:41.080
that we felt like we weren't really solving a problem.

08:41.080 --> 08:44.440
And while it was, like, iteratively better, it wasn't, like, 10 times better.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.840
And in that sense, we were kind of fighting an uphill battle.

08:46.840 --> 08:52.680
So during our time in an accelerator already after school, we said, we believe in the underlying

08:52.680 --> 08:56.720
thesis of Bowtie, which is that, like, apps are becoming increasingly irrelevant, like,

08:56.720 --> 08:59.840
65% of users down the zero new apps a month.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.800
And that all these types of businesses, like, local businesses and things like that, are

09:03.800 --> 09:06.760
still pumping money into apps that nobody really wants.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.720
So then we spoke to a bunch of different people, did research.

09:09.720 --> 09:14.200
And then basically, like, after a few conversations, one of which was with, like, a beauty expert

09:14.200 --> 09:19.440
in our accelerator, CEO of Theave at the time, a lot of Gregory, we said, you know, we're

09:19.440 --> 09:21.280
considering the beauty space.

09:21.280 --> 09:22.880
And then she's like, yeah, you know, I don't know.

09:22.880 --> 09:23.880
Like, let me think about it.

09:23.880 --> 09:28.320
And then two days later, she's like, no, she's like, this is a real issue for the sector.

09:28.320 --> 09:31.880
And then after doing our own research, we found a variety of reasons why it really made

09:31.880 --> 09:36.560
sense to actually dive in and apply the technology to them.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.560
Okay.

09:37.560 --> 09:40.680
And what kind of response have you received?

09:40.680 --> 09:45.800
And generally, these kind of, you know, mom and pop shops for lack of a better term,

09:45.800 --> 09:51.240
like, they're, they are historically really difficult to gain traction in for startups.

09:51.240 --> 09:53.480
What are you doing to try to overcome that?

09:53.480 --> 09:58.480
So we basically have like a variety of techniques that we employ, whether that's like, drip emails

09:58.480 --> 10:01.000
or like, cold calling to trade shows.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.960
And what we found was it definitely, like, the trade shows is the most effective.

10:04.960 --> 10:08.840
And it kind of draws the people who are looking for new technology to begin with.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.200
And I think that that's been really helpful for us.

10:11.200 --> 10:14.320
And they're also really happy because we're the only ones who are providing this type of

10:14.320 --> 10:15.400
solution.

10:15.400 --> 10:17.920
And it's a problem that they're very aware of that they have.

10:17.920 --> 10:22.080
So that being able to kind of like deliver on something that they know is an issue has

10:22.080 --> 10:23.720
been very helpful for us.

10:23.720 --> 10:24.720
Okay.

10:24.720 --> 10:28.440
One of the benefits about working with these types of businesses is that they pay attention

10:28.440 --> 10:32.200
to numbers and, you know, real improvement in their business.

10:32.200 --> 10:37.280
So if you can prove that, say, where we can handle, you know, X percent of their call

10:37.280 --> 10:42.800
volume or get them X dollars in incremental revenue, like that really resonates with

10:42.800 --> 10:43.800
them.

10:43.800 --> 10:48.400
Because at the end of the day, like, you know, even a small amount of incremental revenue

10:48.400 --> 10:51.760
can make a huge difference for these smaller shops.

10:51.760 --> 10:58.080
And so in contrasting that with like consumer behavior where it's a lot more sort of up in

10:58.080 --> 11:02.240
the air, like, you know, this is fun to use, like, there's so many other alternatives.

11:02.240 --> 11:06.040
But for us, it's like if we can really show them that it's going to materially improve

11:06.040 --> 11:09.680
their business, then that really resonates with them.

11:09.680 --> 11:13.920
So what are some of the biggest challenges you face from machine learning and AI perspective

11:13.920 --> 11:15.920
and pulling this all together?

11:15.920 --> 11:16.920
Yeah.

11:16.920 --> 11:20.680
So I would say, as you can imagine, the biggest challenge for us is that we started off

11:20.680 --> 11:22.080
with zero data.

11:22.080 --> 11:26.840
And so we really had to bootstrap the automation with like proprietary algorithms, just doing

11:26.840 --> 11:31.920
lots and lots of research into like, what do people say, how do people say it, and sort

11:31.920 --> 11:37.200
of slowly collect enough data that we could start training a model and start to generalize

11:37.200 --> 11:38.200
a little bit.

11:38.200 --> 11:42.760
But as you, when you start doing this type of thing, you quickly realize that like people

11:42.760 --> 11:46.840
say things in a million different ways, like, how many ways can you ask for a haircut,

11:46.840 --> 11:47.840
right?

11:47.840 --> 11:50.920
You'd really be surprised when you ask for a haircut.

11:50.920 --> 11:55.040
And there's also so many other requests that like we never would have thought of that someone

11:55.040 --> 11:59.800
might even text, like, do you guys offer organic products?

11:59.800 --> 12:04.440
When we set out to build a system that could help people book appointments and reschedule

12:04.440 --> 12:08.480
and ask for prices or whatever, there's a lot of things that we never even considered

12:08.480 --> 12:11.600
where like requests that would be coming in.

12:11.600 --> 12:17.120
And that is what makes the customer service space difficult in general if you're trying

12:17.120 --> 12:22.080
to automate it, just like the breadth of requests that come in.

12:22.080 --> 12:26.720
But that's one of the reasons why we chose to start off in such a narrow vertical is that

12:26.720 --> 12:30.760
it makes it vastly easier to handle those requests.

12:30.760 --> 12:36.720
Whereas if we wanted to, you know, there's a lot of companies out there like ASAP and digital

12:36.720 --> 12:42.120
genius who are trying to sort of augment or automate call centers and very generalized

12:42.120 --> 12:43.640
customer service.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.760
And that is a very, very difficult problem.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.080
So we're trying to be a little bit more narrow.

12:48.080 --> 12:55.000
And so have you developed any particular kinds of tools or approaches for kind of starting

12:55.000 --> 13:00.880
in a whittle down that long tail of requests or well, how do you handle that?

13:00.880 --> 13:01.880
Yeah.

13:01.880 --> 13:08.400
So the majority of requests that do come in are things that, you know, we've sort of collected

13:08.400 --> 13:14.040
over the past six months and to be honest, it's a very manual process of like figuring

13:14.040 --> 13:17.720
out what a new request might be.

13:17.720 --> 13:23.160
And you know, there's, you can get 80%, you know, classic 80, 20 will here, like you

13:23.160 --> 13:29.520
can get 80% of those requests with like 20% of the work.

13:29.520 --> 13:33.680
And the other one, you know, like 20% of their requests might be sort of smaller or random

13:33.680 --> 13:34.680
things.

13:34.680 --> 13:39.320
And what we do is whenever there's something that we don't understand, we like mark that

13:39.320 --> 13:40.640
in our system.

13:40.640 --> 13:45.720
And then, you know, every once in a while we go through that list and pull out trends

13:45.720 --> 13:49.600
that we're seeing, like initially we didn't realize that so many people would get to the

13:49.600 --> 13:54.400
end of a booking process and ask for the price, but we found that looking at our data and

13:54.400 --> 13:57.840
going back and saying like, okay, this is something that we now have to handle.

13:57.840 --> 14:01.000
And there's also a lot of requests that are like served specific to a business.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.520
So someone might be like, where do I park?

14:03.520 --> 14:04.520
And that sort of thing.

14:04.520 --> 14:07.680
So that's another aspect that makes this difficult.

14:07.680 --> 14:13.840
But what we've done there is like created basically a custom FAQ system where a business

14:13.840 --> 14:17.240
can go and enter in their own questions and answers.

14:17.240 --> 14:22.600
And we use a mix of our own tools, along with Microsoft's Q&A service, to handle those

14:22.600 --> 14:25.520
like sort of more one-off questions and answers.

14:25.520 --> 14:26.680
Okay.

14:26.680 --> 14:33.120
It sounds like you're not doing any human and loo type of aspect to this where if a request

14:33.120 --> 14:39.320
comes in and it's not understood, it's kind of escalated to some agents that you or the

14:39.320 --> 14:41.400
customer is managing.

14:41.400 --> 14:43.760
Oh, so we actually do do that.

14:43.760 --> 14:47.720
If something doesn't understand something, then we pass it off to a human.

14:47.720 --> 14:52.440
And that's typically, you know, the business is existing customer support staff.

14:52.440 --> 14:55.280
So that might be receptionist or even a call center.

14:55.280 --> 14:58.920
And so we, anything we don't understand, it gets passed off to a human.

14:58.920 --> 15:02.160
But in terms of marking it in our system as something that we might want to handle in

15:02.160 --> 15:06.120
the future, that process is sort of difficult to automate.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.240
And that's something that we're working on.

15:07.240 --> 15:12.360
And we even have sort of a dashboard that the business operators work in.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.880
And we're planning on adding tools in there that would actually allow the operator to go

15:15.880 --> 15:19.920
highlight a sentence and say like, this is something that the bot didn't get, but is

15:19.920 --> 15:21.840
a common request that we get.

15:21.840 --> 15:26.760
And then they could either add that to their FAQ automatically or sort of like you said,

15:26.760 --> 15:30.160
escalate that to us and we would go work on it.

15:30.160 --> 15:36.720
And is it your sense that something like that would be readily adopted by, I'm imagining

15:36.720 --> 15:37.720
us a lot on ours.

15:37.720 --> 15:42.000
And I'm assuming you're going after not kind of these big chains alarms, but like smaller

15:42.000 --> 15:45.560
shops, like, are they going to want to even think about that?

15:45.560 --> 15:47.320
Well, we're going for both.

15:47.320 --> 15:51.080
So there are, that we do have some bigger clients that are nationwide and they're easier

15:51.080 --> 15:52.080
to work with.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.080
But then they have their own like technology issues.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.680
So they have like systems that we want, they want us to integrate with.

15:56.680 --> 15:59.800
But in terms of the smaller businesses, as long as you give them something on a mobile

15:59.800 --> 16:02.640
device, I actually do feel like they're pretty open to it.

16:02.640 --> 16:06.240
But they also have like a very low tolerance for error because of the fact that they're

16:06.240 --> 16:07.240
in the service business.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.720
So like you really have to nail it the first time.

16:09.720 --> 16:10.800
Interesting.

16:10.800 --> 16:17.960
On the conversational side, did you start off on one of the commercial conversational platforms

16:17.960 --> 16:23.280
or did you roll your own, I'm thinking here of things like API.ai and other things?

16:23.280 --> 16:24.280
Yeah.

16:24.280 --> 16:28.760
So we actually, you know, we tried all those platforms out when we set out to do this initially

16:28.760 --> 16:31.640
and found that it was just too much of a black box.

16:31.640 --> 16:38.120
So when you, you know, we have real clients using this product, then it really can't mess

16:38.120 --> 16:44.640
up on things that are like easily remedied if we had our own more customizable model and

16:44.640 --> 16:45.640
system.

16:45.640 --> 16:50.160
Well, it's an example of something that you found it messed up a lot on that given your

16:50.160 --> 16:52.480
own platform was easily remediedable.

16:52.480 --> 16:53.480
Yeah, definitely.

16:53.480 --> 17:00.280
So, for example, Solon Service is called Single Process and I had no idea that existed

17:00.280 --> 17:05.200
before entering the space, but if you, to me, I'm thinking versus multi-threaded, but

17:05.200 --> 17:07.600
that's probably the same thing, right?

17:07.600 --> 17:12.400
So Single Process is like two pretty common words together.

17:12.400 --> 17:17.760
And if you just say, if you just piped in a sentence to an out-of-the-box model that's

17:17.760 --> 17:21.680
said like, can I come in for a single process next Friday?

17:21.680 --> 17:23.360
It wouldn't recognize that as an entity, right?

17:23.360 --> 17:26.680
Because it'd be the process as the entity in single is like exactly.

17:26.680 --> 17:31.080
It's like a quantity, it might pick it up as a quantity, process is like, is that even

17:31.080 --> 17:32.080
like a service?

17:32.080 --> 17:34.760
Or is it, process is also a pretty general term, right?

17:34.760 --> 17:40.080
So what we found is that we really had to augment and customize the system to be able

17:40.080 --> 17:44.160
to work with even the most simple things in real production.

17:44.160 --> 17:48.360
And that's actually very doable because we have, you know, a list of all the services

17:48.360 --> 17:50.480
that the businesses have.

17:50.480 --> 17:56.360
And over time, we've sort of automated the process of creating aliases in different alternative

17:56.360 --> 17:57.360
ways.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.080
People ask for things.

17:59.080 --> 18:04.200
And those are things that you just can't input into a black box model that you might find

18:04.200 --> 18:06.320
with like with that AI.

18:06.320 --> 18:10.760
And so what we found is that those things are good for like, you know, sort of a small

18:10.760 --> 18:17.240
talk kind of bought or, or maybe something a little bit more geared towards one-off responses

18:17.240 --> 18:23.400
like a Q&A type of thing, but in terms of having a full conversation and holding state

18:23.400 --> 18:32.080
and entities in the context of a very particular business and meeting very high accuracy to

18:32.080 --> 18:37.240
input the exact appointment that the user is asking for, that required a lot more customization.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.240
Okay.

18:38.240 --> 18:42.320
And so what, tell me a little bit about the effort involved in building out that platform

18:42.320 --> 18:47.280
and what were some of the difficult decisions that you had to make and which way you ended

18:47.280 --> 18:48.280
up going on those?

18:48.280 --> 18:49.800
Yeah, definitely.

18:49.800 --> 18:55.720
So one of the big challenges was integrating into the businesses in the first place.

18:55.720 --> 18:56.720
Okay.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.600
So we work with mind-body businesses.

18:59.600 --> 19:05.160
Mind-body is a scheduling platform that has, you know, fitness, beauty, wellness businesses.

19:05.160 --> 19:09.440
And we use our API to sort of pull in the business information when they onboard.

19:09.440 --> 19:15.440
So their staff members, their services, their availability and so forth.

19:15.440 --> 19:21.520
And what we've found is that every single, not every single business, but many of the businesses

19:21.520 --> 19:27.600
on this platform have their menu structured or written out in a different way.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.920
They're like super messy, right?

19:28.920 --> 19:33.000
Because when they're writing it out, all they need for it to do is for the receptionist

19:33.000 --> 19:38.760
to be able to like click a drop-down and then find the service that the user is asking

19:38.760 --> 19:41.280
for on the phone and then put it into the appointment.

19:41.280 --> 19:46.800
But when we are trying to automate that process, we have to be able to capture, however

19:46.800 --> 19:51.200
customer asks for it, we have to drill down to what specific service they're asking for.

19:51.200 --> 19:54.320
So if they say laser hair removal, we need to be able to figure out if they're looking

19:54.320 --> 20:00.040
for laser hair removal on their chin or on their forearm because those are all the specific

20:00.040 --> 20:02.520
services in the system.

20:02.520 --> 20:08.600
And so just importing and integrating into many businesses and sort of generalizing that

20:08.600 --> 20:15.160
process on top of automated conversations has been a real challenge because it doesn't

20:15.160 --> 20:21.120
come in as clean structure data where it's like service 1, you know, name plus 10 ways

20:21.120 --> 20:22.120
of asking for it.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.760
Service 2, name plus 10 ways of asking for it.

20:24.760 --> 20:30.280
And so when we think about doing this at scale, we not only have to develop sort of models

20:30.280 --> 20:36.600
for talking to the user back and forth, but also importing businesses, menu data and

20:36.600 --> 20:41.200
structuring it and cleaning it up and not having to do that all manually.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.200
Okay.

20:42.200 --> 20:49.920
Do your customers ever ask you about wanting to have input into kind of the personality

20:49.920 --> 20:55.200
if you will of their bots, like whether they're formal or informal or, you know, use a

20:55.200 --> 21:00.200
Southern draw in the text or something like that, like, is that something that comes

21:00.200 --> 21:01.200
up?

21:01.200 --> 21:02.200
Yeah.

21:02.200 --> 21:05.640
So we've had some really weird requests, like one person wanted their AI to be like an

21:05.640 --> 21:06.640
AI dog.

21:06.640 --> 21:11.560
So they wanted a bunch of dog references throughout the model and other times, if it's like

21:11.560 --> 21:15.800
a larger brand, if there's one that's like as a global presence, they were very like

21:15.800 --> 21:20.280
formal and they really wanted it to be like very fancy in their language.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.880
So there's definitely always a back and forth between me saying that's fine and then Mike

21:23.880 --> 21:28.320
telling me that I could take like another 10 hours.

21:28.320 --> 21:29.320
So yes.

21:29.320 --> 21:33.960
How do those kind of requests impact the system that you've built?

21:33.960 --> 21:35.960
Yeah.

21:35.960 --> 21:41.440
So the good thing is that a lot of those personality tweaks are just changes in copy in terms of

21:41.440 --> 21:43.320
the messages that we sent out right.

21:43.320 --> 21:48.640
So what we've done is just created a bunch of different places in the conversation where

21:48.640 --> 21:51.480
the business can then go and tweak the message.

21:51.480 --> 21:57.000
So around really core stuff, like, this is your booking, does it look right?

21:57.000 --> 22:01.520
You know, we don't want them to be able to tweak every single word, but what we do is

22:01.520 --> 22:06.320
like in the confirmation message text that the user gets when they've completed a booking,

22:06.320 --> 22:12.000
we might have a section at the bottom where the business can add anything they want there.

22:12.000 --> 22:15.480
So if they have a cancellation policy that they need to highlight or if they have like

22:15.480 --> 22:20.840
special sort of something that they need to tell the user, like to not, you know, go

22:20.840 --> 22:24.680
sun 10 two weeks before the deployment or whatever, then they would put that there.

22:24.680 --> 22:27.080
So we have like a bunch of slots that they can modify.

22:27.080 --> 22:34.200
Interesting. And then in terms of the kind of the MLAI tech, you know, having built up

22:34.200 --> 22:41.000
this platform from scratch, what are some of the, you know, toolkits and languages and

22:41.000 --> 22:43.000
like, what does the stack look like for you guys?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.000
Yeah, definitely.

22:44.000 --> 22:50.080
So we do everything in Python and in my opinion, the best language or data science, one

22:50.080 --> 22:51.240
of the best languages in general.

22:51.240 --> 22:56.880
But so we use Eski learned for a lot of the sort of out of the box models that we then

22:56.880 --> 23:04.600
go and, you know, for any model really, most of the work goes into the feature engineering,

23:04.600 --> 23:08.880
feature selection and data cleaning, all that stuff that goes into it before actually,

23:08.880 --> 23:14.200
you know, doing the math and the regression or the classification behind it.

23:14.200 --> 23:20.440
And so Eski learned, we use pretty extensively, NLTK is a great natural language processing

23:20.440 --> 23:23.680
library that comes right bundled with Python.

23:23.680 --> 23:27.160
We use that for a lot of, you know, like part of speech tagging, that type of thing.

23:27.160 --> 23:34.160
And then we use spacey.io, which is another NLP library that can do like syntax, parsing

23:34.160 --> 23:39.440
at very high speeds compared to other more state of the art models that are a lot slower

23:39.440 --> 23:43.360
in terms of like real time parsing.

23:43.360 --> 23:48.200
And yeah, we're experimenting right now with TensorFlow and sort of the more, some of the

23:48.200 --> 23:53.280
deep learnings that would like work vectors and potentially looking into LSTMs for the

23:53.280 --> 23:55.000
energy recognition stuff.

23:55.000 --> 24:00.880
But at this point, the data that we have isn't quite at the volume that you would need

24:00.880 --> 24:04.040
to do to do word vectors successfully.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.240
And we're still experimenting with that.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.240
Okay.

24:07.240 --> 24:08.240
Awesome.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.240
Awesome.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.240
What's next?

24:10.240 --> 24:12.600
What are some of the big things you're looking forward to on, you know, either the business

24:12.600 --> 24:16.440
or tech side or big challenges that you're looking to overcome?

24:16.440 --> 24:22.360
So now, I think it's just about being able to like shrink down the testing phase for each

24:22.360 --> 24:25.680
of the clients that we work with because of what I was saying with their little tolerance

24:25.680 --> 24:26.680
for error.

24:26.680 --> 24:31.120
So we have like a huge influx of interest because they're very excited about the whole idea.

24:31.120 --> 24:34.200
And then they're expecting to work 110% of the time.

24:34.200 --> 24:38.360
So just being able to make sure that we can basically give it to them and for it to launch

24:38.360 --> 24:44.480
and for them to be able to basically all have zero errors from the beginning, like ironing

24:44.480 --> 24:48.720
out that process because now we're really like scaling out the platform, I think that's

24:48.720 --> 24:52.880
the main issue for it, for me at least, in terms of what's next.

24:52.880 --> 24:53.880
Anything to add, Mike?

24:53.880 --> 25:00.600
Yeah, I would say I think basically scaling the onboarding process like Ron sort of getting

25:00.600 --> 25:01.600
at it.

25:01.600 --> 25:05.680
And then also thinking about, you know, this may be a little bit far off, but you know,

25:05.680 --> 25:08.920
it's something that we started thinking about as like expanding into other verticals.

25:08.920 --> 25:13.560
And so how do we sort of transfer the models and the knowledge that we have from this particular

25:13.560 --> 25:17.520
vertical and make it more generalizable and make, you know, if we get into real estate

25:17.520 --> 25:23.880
that we won't have to bootstrap the automated conversations there like we did for this.

25:23.880 --> 25:30.760
And so in that vein, there's going to be a lot of sort of how do we separate out the

25:30.760 --> 25:37.960
beauty specific aspects of the model and maybe try to extract the appointment booking aspects

25:37.960 --> 25:39.480
and sort of try to generalize everything.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.680
So that's something not about thinking about a lot.

25:41.680 --> 25:46.080
Awesome. Ron and Mike, thanks so much for taking the time to chat with us.
