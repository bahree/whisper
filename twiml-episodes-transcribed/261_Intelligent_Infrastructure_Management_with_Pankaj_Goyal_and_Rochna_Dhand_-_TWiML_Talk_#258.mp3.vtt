00:00.000 --> 00:16.320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

00:16.320 --> 00:21.480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:21.480 --> 00:29.120
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:29.120 --> 00:33.760
Before we get going, I'd like to send a huge thanks to our friends at HPE for sponsoring

00:33.760 --> 00:39.080
this week's series of shows from the O'Reilly AI Conference in New York City.

00:39.080 --> 00:44.560
At the conference, and in my chat with them, HPE's punkage Goyal and Rochena Don discuss

00:44.560 --> 00:49.600
how large enterprises can unlock the value of their data using AI, and they detail the

00:49.600 --> 00:55.800
workings of HPE InfoSight, which is the company's cloud-based solution for helping IT organizations

00:55.800 --> 01:00.760
better manage and ensure the health of an enterprise's IT infrastructure.

01:00.760 --> 01:05.680
Now I've previously written about this category of AI-enabled operations management tools,

01:05.680 --> 01:08.080
which folks refer to as AIOPS.

01:08.080 --> 01:13.400
It is a very interesting use case for AI, and as you'll hear, HPE has an interesting

01:13.400 --> 01:15.120
story in this space.

01:15.120 --> 01:26.760
For more information on HPE InfoSight, visit twomalai.com slash HPE.

01:26.760 --> 01:27.760
All right, everyone.

01:27.760 --> 01:35.600
I am here in New York City for the O'Reilly AI Conference, and I'm with punkage Goyal,

01:35.600 --> 01:43.760
and Rochena Don, punkage is the vice president for AI and HPE product management at HPE,

01:43.760 --> 01:48.320
and Rochena is director of product management with HPE InfoSight.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.880
Punkage and Rochena, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

01:51.880 --> 01:52.880
Thank you.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.680
Thank you, Sam, for having us.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.680
Absolutely.

01:55.680 --> 01:56.680
Absolutely.

01:56.680 --> 02:00.480
I am excited to jump into our conversation.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.160
Punkage, you're key noting at some point.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.560
One is that, or both of you.

02:04.560 --> 02:05.560
Both of us.

02:05.560 --> 02:12.160
It is today, afternoon, and our topic is how HPE's helping our customers get the best

02:12.160 --> 02:14.320
out of their data by using AI.

02:14.320 --> 02:15.320
Awesome, awesome.

02:15.320 --> 02:18.800
We'll dive into that, but before we do, I'd love to learn a little bit more about your

02:18.800 --> 02:19.800
background.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.800
Why don't we start with you, punkage?

02:21.800 --> 02:22.800
Sure, Sam.

02:22.800 --> 02:26.720
I'm a computer science engineer by background, by education.

02:26.720 --> 02:32.600
Back in the days, actually, I did my bachelor thesis in national language processing when

02:32.600 --> 02:39.560
we were trying to parse a mixed language text, a mixture of multiple languages, and since

02:39.560 --> 02:44.160
then, it is fascinating to see how the world of machine learning has evolved over the

02:44.160 --> 02:46.680
last 10 to 15 years.

02:46.680 --> 02:54.360
I did a stint at McKinsey and company as a management consultant in tech industry, and

02:54.360 --> 02:59.640
I also ran a startup in the mobility space back in India at HPE.

02:59.640 --> 03:06.360
I today lead the product management for this exciting space of AI and high performance computing.

03:06.360 --> 03:12.840
And before that, I used to run business operations and strategy for our data center business.

03:12.840 --> 03:13.840
Awesome.

03:13.840 --> 03:14.840
Awesome.

03:14.840 --> 03:16.320
Thank you, Raja.

03:16.320 --> 03:20.920
So I started, again, my training as a masters in computer science, and I did an undergrad

03:20.920 --> 03:23.680
degree in computer science as well.

03:23.680 --> 03:28.440
And my specialty actually was computer graphics, and so as soon as I graduated, I made a

03:28.440 --> 03:34.080
B-line for SGI, which was the hot computer graphics company at the time long, long ago.

03:34.080 --> 03:38.720
But ever since then, I've worked at a series of high growth startups, mostly through

03:38.720 --> 03:41.200
the category defining startups.

03:41.200 --> 03:46.840
I worked for Love Cloud, which was Netscape Founder Mark in recent startup after he was

03:46.840 --> 03:47.840
ESP, right?

03:47.840 --> 03:48.840
Yes.

03:48.840 --> 03:49.840
Cloud before Cloud.

03:49.840 --> 03:50.840
Wow.

03:50.840 --> 03:51.840
I saw it before.

03:51.840 --> 03:54.600
You know, it was before virtualization came along, and so Cloud was hard to do before

03:54.600 --> 03:56.680
there was virtual machines.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.480
And so I was there for about five years.

03:59.480 --> 04:03.360
We learned a lot, and from there, I went to VMware, and I said virtualization is going

04:03.360 --> 04:05.480
to solve a lot of problems.

04:05.480 --> 04:07.720
And so I did product management there.

04:07.720 --> 04:13.720
I did a lot of work in the hypervisor, and we centered the management of flagship product.

04:13.720 --> 04:18.360
And then from there, I went to Nimble Storage, and Nimble was really small.

04:18.360 --> 04:23.880
And that is where we thought about how to bring AI to the IT industry alongside our main

04:23.880 --> 04:28.560
line of business, which was storage enterprise storage.

04:28.560 --> 04:33.120
And then Nimble Storage got acquired by HP approximately two years ago.

04:33.120 --> 04:37.720
And I've been heading on product management for Infosight, which is our AI ops product

04:37.720 --> 04:38.720
at HP.

04:38.720 --> 04:42.240
So, Pankaj, why don't you walk us through a little bit of the presentation that you're

04:42.240 --> 04:47.360
giving and the way you think about AI at HP?

04:47.360 --> 04:48.360
Sure, Sam.

04:48.360 --> 04:52.560
So, we are really in living in some really exciting times today.

04:52.560 --> 04:59.480
AI has come a long way in terms of expanding the world of possibilities.

04:59.480 --> 05:03.280
And it can be attributed to the data explosion that we have seen, and also the compute power

05:03.280 --> 05:08.240
explosion that we have seen over the last, I would say three to five years.

05:08.240 --> 05:12.520
Even in our personal lives, AI touches each of us very closely.

05:12.520 --> 05:18.000
My two kids, five and two year olds, they actually know how to talk to our voice assistants.

05:18.000 --> 05:24.040
And it's amazing to see how they interact with all these AI driven machines and gadgets

05:24.040 --> 05:25.960
in our homes.

05:25.960 --> 05:31.400
We at HP truly believe in this power of transformation, which is being enabled through AI.

05:31.400 --> 05:37.560
It is almost a natural step where we collected a lot of data over the last five to ten years.

05:37.560 --> 05:42.880
And now we are trying to get the real insights which can impact the way we live and the way

05:42.880 --> 05:45.640
we work in our daily lives.

05:45.640 --> 05:50.080
We are truly excited about this potential and it is one of the top priorities for us as

05:50.080 --> 05:51.600
a company.

05:51.600 --> 05:56.000
When we think of AI, we really think of it in three pillars.

05:56.000 --> 06:02.760
Pillar number one is how we are bringing the best people, the best technology and the

06:02.760 --> 06:09.320
best partners to our customers, to adopt AI, to help them in their journey towards an

06:09.320 --> 06:11.800
AI lead transformation.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.640
And I'm going to talk more about it.

06:14.640 --> 06:20.400
Pillar number two is how we are adopting, how we are changing ourselves by using AI machine

06:20.400 --> 06:24.040
learning as a next frontier.

06:24.040 --> 06:30.240
And how we are enriching our product portfolio to enable new customer experiences, especially

06:30.240 --> 06:36.680
in the field of data center operations, which are becoming more and more complex day-by-day.

06:36.680 --> 06:42.960
And what Roshna is leading is tremendously impactful and we are already seeing solid positive

06:42.960 --> 06:44.440
results.

06:44.440 --> 06:50.360
And then Pillar number three is how we are investing in the future of AI.

06:50.360 --> 06:53.360
As you all know, AI is a dynamic field.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.160
Not all the problems have been solved.

06:55.160 --> 07:01.920
There's a lot of research going on to understand the next generation of algorithms, the next

07:01.920 --> 07:06.520
generation of technologies which will power those algorithms.

07:06.520 --> 07:13.400
And through our efforts by Hewlett Packard Enterprise Labs, we are investing in these efforts

07:13.400 --> 07:19.600
specifically around memory driven computing, which becomes really critical as the data set

07:19.600 --> 07:22.240
size increases.

07:22.240 --> 07:28.480
And through our efforts to understand the next generation of accelerators like dot product

07:28.480 --> 07:31.760
engine, which is our efforts to effort towards it.

07:31.760 --> 07:38.840
So these are three pillars for us, AI for our customers, number two, AI within our own

07:38.840 --> 07:39.840
products.

07:39.840 --> 07:42.400
And the number three is AI for the future.

07:42.400 --> 07:47.160
When you think about AI for your customers, how do you characterize where your customers

07:47.160 --> 07:48.160
are?

07:48.160 --> 07:53.000
Each piece of huge company, lots of customers, lots of different sizes and shapes and industries.

07:53.000 --> 07:57.560
Is there any kind of one way that you think about where that customer base is with regards

07:57.560 --> 07:58.560
to AI?

07:58.560 --> 08:04.320
We are definitely seeing that all the customers are not at the same point in their AI journey.

08:04.320 --> 08:10.760
We think of customers in three different stages on the maturity of their AI adoption.

08:10.760 --> 08:15.720
There are a large set of enterprise customers which are just getting started.

08:15.720 --> 08:20.280
So they do not know the exact AI use cases.

08:20.280 --> 08:23.680
They are almost anxious about adopting AI.

08:23.680 --> 08:26.760
But they are trying to figure out what to do about it.

08:26.760 --> 08:33.160
Number two is we have a set of customers which have figured out where to get started,

08:33.160 --> 08:34.760
but they are experimenting a lot.

08:34.760 --> 08:39.200
I think a lot of enterprise AI is experimentation today.

08:39.200 --> 08:43.640
And then number three, we have a set of advanced customers.

08:43.640 --> 08:48.480
And to their credit, they have been investing in AI for 5, 10, 15, 20 years.

08:48.480 --> 08:55.520
And they have reached a stage where AI is almost in their DNA of how they work, how they strategize,

08:55.520 --> 09:00.320
and how they shape up the future of not only their own company, but the whole industry.

09:00.320 --> 09:03.400
And we work with them a lot as well.

09:03.400 --> 09:10.000
Depending on the maturity stage, the help that these customers need from HPE differs.

09:10.000 --> 09:17.000
If you are an enterprise which is looking to get started, HPE helps them by providing

09:17.000 --> 09:22.760
them the advisory services to get started to understand which what is happening in the

09:22.760 --> 09:29.200
industry, what is the landscape like, what are the use cases to get the maximum ROI.

09:29.200 --> 09:32.720
If you are running an experiment, your problem statement is different, your problem statement

09:32.720 --> 09:38.960
is where is my data, what is my data pipeline, how do I get my data scientists, how do I prove

09:38.960 --> 09:44.600
the ROI so that I can get more investments from my CIO or from a CIO.

09:44.600 --> 09:52.400
And there we follow a solution centric approach where we bring in our best in class people,

09:52.400 --> 09:57.040
data scientists, solution architects, data engineers.

09:57.040 --> 10:03.800
And we bring in our best in class technology, right from compute to storage from edge inference

10:03.800 --> 10:09.320
to training in the data center, and then we bring in a curated list of partners who can

10:09.320 --> 10:10.320
help in that journey.

10:10.320 --> 10:13.400
There is a lot of fragmentation in the ecosystem.

10:13.400 --> 10:17.320
Many startups are coming up, everybody is talking about AI.

10:17.320 --> 10:22.440
We act as that trusted partner to help our customers understand which partners to work

10:22.440 --> 10:23.440
with.

10:23.440 --> 10:28.720
And through this combination, we are attacking specific use cases for our customers.

10:28.720 --> 10:34.920
For example, today we work with five leading car companies in helping them in their self-riving

10:34.920 --> 10:36.640
projects.

10:36.640 --> 10:42.320
We are working with leading manufacturing companies in the US and in Asia to help them improve

10:42.320 --> 10:45.720
quality control on their factory floor.

10:45.720 --> 10:50.160
We are working with some of the leading consumer tech companies to solve some of the largest

10:50.160 --> 10:52.240
AI problems.

10:52.240 --> 10:57.400
We are working with some of the leading city governments to enable smart cities and to

10:57.400 --> 11:00.600
build the cities for the next 10 to 20 years.

11:00.600 --> 11:07.680
And we have built and we continue to build some of the largest AI infrastructure or some

11:07.680 --> 11:14.920
of the largest AI supercomputing power or supercomputing infrastructures at a country level, at a

11:14.920 --> 11:23.400
research level to help provide large scale access to these capabilities for startups, for

11:23.400 --> 11:26.720
research, and for enterprise purposes.

11:26.720 --> 11:31.680
And that we do in the US, in Europe, in Japan, across the world.

11:31.680 --> 11:38.920
With all these success stories, we are truly doing some incredible work at HP to push forward,

11:38.920 --> 11:44.600
to help our enterprise customers go through this journey.

11:44.600 --> 11:49.400
Personally, can you elaborate on InfoSight and where InfoSight fits into that mix?

11:49.400 --> 11:50.400
Right.

11:50.400 --> 11:57.040
You know, that's the overarching grade view of punkage that you gave about where all HP's

11:57.040 --> 11:59.040
AI is going.

11:59.040 --> 12:02.720
What we've done in InfoSight is we've taken a sliver of that and what we've told people

12:02.720 --> 12:09.040
is if you're buying a product from HPE, there is AI embedded in that product and what

12:09.040 --> 12:14.000
that will enable that product to do in these enterprise products or a data center products.

12:14.000 --> 12:19.680
What that enables that product to do is our ultimate vision, it is self-managing, self-healing,

12:19.680 --> 12:21.400
self-optimizing.

12:21.400 --> 12:27.840
So for example, if you're buying a storage appliance from HPE, be it nimble storage,

12:27.840 --> 12:34.640
three-par storage, it comes embedded with thousands of sensors that it's sending back to our

12:34.640 --> 12:40.720
own HPE Cloud, where we're doing a very aggressive AI on and have been doing for a very long

12:40.720 --> 12:44.160
time, more than seven years now.

12:44.160 --> 12:49.880
And as a result of what we have been able to do with that data that's coming home across

12:49.880 --> 12:54.760
the globe, across the install base, we have been able to predict issues that can happen

12:54.760 --> 13:00.360
in the field and prevent issues that happen for customers in the field.

13:00.360 --> 13:03.760
And so when you're buying one of these appliances and you install them in your data center,

13:03.760 --> 13:08.080
for example, there's a lot of benefits you see from them.

13:08.080 --> 13:16.920
So for example, the amount of time and skill level you need to manage one of these devices

13:16.920 --> 13:17.920
goes down.

13:17.920 --> 13:22.920
We've measured recently doing surveys of our customers anywhere from 75% to 90% fewer

13:22.920 --> 13:25.280
resources required.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.360
They run optimally.

13:26.360 --> 13:34.200
We have a customer recently who participated in an activity with us to actually quantify

13:34.200 --> 13:38.280
what they've been able to get through buying these products that are embedded with AI that

13:38.280 --> 13:43.200
managed themselves, and they showed us how they saved close to a million dollars and

13:43.200 --> 13:49.920
not having to buy additional hardware equipment because through the machine learning that we

13:49.920 --> 13:53.400
do in the back, we were able to tell them how they can recover resources and optimize

13:53.400 --> 13:57.440
how they run applications on these capabilities.

13:57.440 --> 14:01.840
So basically what we're doing is saying, hey, the IT industry, the IT people today are

14:01.840 --> 14:10.600
used to enabling AI for their businesses, whether it's selling widgets or optimizing your sales,

14:10.600 --> 14:11.920
targets, etc.

14:11.920 --> 14:16.000
But what is AI doing for the IT industry itself?

14:16.000 --> 14:20.720
And that's where Infosight comes in, is where we actually enable these capabilities,

14:20.720 --> 14:25.640
these products to manage themselves, and they can be software products or hardware products.

14:25.640 --> 14:31.640
You mentioned that the devices, like the storage devices, have thousands of sensors in them.

14:31.640 --> 14:37.000
I think of thousands of sensors, I think of an aircraft engine, like the classic GE example.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.600
What are the sensors in a storage array?

14:39.600 --> 14:43.920
And so they can be pretty complicated devices.

14:43.920 --> 14:48.840
Our customers consider the mission critical because they have mission critical applications

14:48.840 --> 14:49.840
running on them.

14:49.840 --> 14:54.120
They could have had a trading application running where latency, which is a concept of

14:54.120 --> 15:01.600
a response time, if they miss latencies by some seconds, it can be pretty, the financial

15:01.600 --> 15:03.240
losses can be pretty big.

15:03.240 --> 15:07.920
So these are capabilities that have to, while lives don't depend on them, they are mission

15:07.920 --> 15:09.680
critical to businesses.

15:09.680 --> 15:11.960
So the sensors are widespread.

15:11.960 --> 15:17.920
They could be sensors that measure in lots of details how the different components inside

15:17.920 --> 15:21.480
the box is doing, so how is the CPU performing right now?

15:21.480 --> 15:26.160
CPU itself has tens and 20 sensors itself.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.440
There's a concept called a CPU ready.

15:28.440 --> 15:32.840
The is an application waiting to get compute, or does it have the computer needs, which

15:32.840 --> 15:34.960
application is getting the compute?

15:34.960 --> 15:36.800
Memory has a lot of sensors.

15:36.800 --> 15:41.840
If you look at how an application flows with the CPU, there's memory, there's lots of

15:41.840 --> 15:44.840
cards, how what is the health of each card?

15:44.840 --> 15:50.200
And so if you actually pry open these things, there are a lot of factors that can indicate

15:50.200 --> 15:51.200
health.

15:51.200 --> 15:52.960
And then there's the whole software stack, right?

15:52.960 --> 15:59.920
Because every stack behaving the way it needs to behave, there's very complex file systems

15:59.920 --> 16:00.920
and these.

16:00.920 --> 16:04.960
And so who's consuming the most resource, who's waiting for a resource?

16:04.960 --> 16:09.560
And then there are some more traditional sensors like fans and temperatures and stuff like

16:09.560 --> 16:11.520
that, but some of them are very critical.

16:11.520 --> 16:16.400
The interesting thing is the infosite idea came from the acquisition of Nimble Storage.

16:16.400 --> 16:20.920
And Nimble Storage's first line of code was written about eight to nine years ago when

16:20.920 --> 16:23.400
the company was founded.

16:23.400 --> 16:28.520
And by that time, there was this vision that IoT has arrived, not just for consumer products,

16:28.520 --> 16:31.200
but for enterprise products and the data center as well.

16:31.200 --> 16:38.840
And so when our engineers wrote the first line of code, they had that vision in mind of

16:38.840 --> 16:42.240
they needed to telemetrize everything that they're writing.

16:42.240 --> 16:47.040
So they actually built very deep sensors into each and every line of code, thinking that

16:47.040 --> 16:51.240
later when they go into debugging mode or when they understand how products behave in customers,

16:51.240 --> 16:55.040
environments and data centers, this will actually help them, right?

16:55.040 --> 16:58.800
I mean, initially what we had was like a doctor status scope.

16:58.800 --> 17:02.800
And now what we have are these very fancy MRI machines, so that's kind of the equivalent

17:02.800 --> 17:05.880
they had those MRI machines in mind when they wrote that.

17:05.880 --> 17:09.960
And so it tells you about the health, it tells you about the performance, it tells you

17:09.960 --> 17:14.040
what events that are going on, falls as well.

17:14.040 --> 17:18.040
It tells you about configuration settings, each customer sets these things up with the

17:18.040 --> 17:19.880
different configurations.

17:19.880 --> 17:24.880
I think we often talk about technologies that were born in the age of the web and technologies

17:24.880 --> 17:31.800
that were born in the age of mobile and how what's available impacts the way technology

17:31.800 --> 17:32.800
evolves.

17:32.800 --> 17:40.360
And the idea of enterprise technology being born in the age of IoT and AI and what the

17:40.360 --> 17:45.520
implications of that are, I think, is kind of an interesting one starting from kind of

17:45.520 --> 17:50.680
taking advantage of all of this telemetry data that's available and pulling it in so

17:50.680 --> 17:53.120
that something can be done with it.

17:53.120 --> 17:54.120
Right.

17:54.120 --> 17:58.920
So there was a leapfrog advantage right by the time we started.

17:58.920 --> 18:02.960
There were a few nasiers in the industry and they said, well, enterprise products, I don't

18:02.960 --> 18:07.600
think mission critical applications, sensitive applications for businesses.

18:07.600 --> 18:11.080
People are not going to send you data just like you connect IoT or consumer product

18:11.080 --> 18:12.080
through IoT.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.520
They're not going to send you this data.

18:14.520 --> 18:18.800
We found out that our attach rate for this data was 97%.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.320
These were enterprise companies.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.040
You mean the customer had the option to do that?

18:22.040 --> 18:23.040
They had the option.

18:23.040 --> 18:27.680
They had to turn it on because it was a time and be one share of customers would send

18:27.680 --> 18:33.200
us streaming data from their highly sensitive equipment back to our cloud and trust us

18:33.200 --> 18:38.040
with that data. We figured by default, we leave it off and the customer can opt in and

18:38.040 --> 18:40.760
we found 97% of our customers opted in.

18:40.760 --> 18:45.480
Some of them initially said they were policies within the companies that they could not send

18:45.480 --> 18:46.480
data out.

18:46.480 --> 18:47.640
They could not connect to the cloud.

18:47.640 --> 18:54.000
They had never done it while lo and behold, the first time they ran into some problem,

18:54.000 --> 18:56.040
we showed them what we could do for other customers.

18:56.040 --> 18:59.480
If you're sitting on these data and the tools that we have to interpret it, the value

18:59.480 --> 19:02.600
then drove them to actually turn that on.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.240
And of course, this is on machine data.

19:04.240 --> 19:07.280
It's not customer sensitive data.

19:07.280 --> 19:13.240
But it is that almost like a revolution where the enterprise products are now seeing what

19:13.240 --> 19:15.760
consumer products can do for them.

19:15.760 --> 19:20.000
At the end of the day, if it's going to save you 80% of your time, that you would otherwise

19:20.000 --> 19:26.640
send, spend in troubleshooting, hairy issues by looking at 20 different graphs, have ten

19:26.640 --> 19:31.640
people involved, and the worst of all, if you talk to enterprise customers and IT people

19:31.640 --> 19:37.320
that actually manage these devices, they have to call multiple vendors for support.

19:37.320 --> 19:40.960
What we did at Dimmel Storage was because we had so much automation and insight built

19:40.960 --> 19:42.320
into our products.

19:42.320 --> 19:45.280
We did not have level 1 and level 2 support engineers.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.400
We never hired those as a startup.

19:47.400 --> 19:51.360
We hired directly level 3 engineers, so how you call on the phone and someone asks you

19:51.360 --> 19:56.440
and tells you to reboot the thing or just gives you some list of a script that they have

19:56.440 --> 19:58.760
and then they pass you to the level 2 engineer.

19:58.760 --> 20:03.480
And then finally, you know, you talk to the gods that are actually talking to the developers.

20:03.480 --> 20:07.560
We eliminated, we never hired and to this day we don't have level 1 level 2 engineers.

20:07.560 --> 20:10.800
You call, you get, go straight to a level 3 engineer.

20:10.800 --> 20:14.600
So the issues that the level 1 and level 2 people would have resolved have been eliminated

20:14.600 --> 20:16.920
through machine learning, AI and automation.

20:16.920 --> 20:20.000
And so those issues don't happen for the customer.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.200
So if the customer is facing an issue and thinking this thing is not behaving the way

20:23.200 --> 20:26.120
you want it to, it's probably a very hairy issue.

20:26.120 --> 20:29.640
So they just call and they talk to a level 3 person.

20:29.640 --> 20:33.040
We're also very proud that when you actually call a level 3 person, we answer the phone

20:33.040 --> 20:34.040
in less than one minute.

20:34.040 --> 20:38.440
So it's not like we're queuing people up because we don't have level 1 level 2.

20:38.440 --> 20:43.120
Our customer satisfaction scores are extremely high, 4.9 out of 5.

20:43.120 --> 20:46.600
This is customer self-reported saying how satisfied they were.

20:46.600 --> 20:51.240
And even these hairy issues we solve in less than 45 minutes.

20:51.240 --> 20:55.400
These are issues that can take weeks sometimes to resolve if you don't have that level of

20:55.400 --> 20:59.680
insight and you have and build the machine learning models to automate.

20:59.680 --> 21:06.640
Can you maybe walk us through one of these, an example of one of these hairy issues that

21:06.640 --> 21:12.200
comes up that may take hours or weeks to troubleshoot and how the data and machine learning

21:12.200 --> 21:13.920
plays into solving that?

21:13.920 --> 21:14.920
Definitely.

21:14.920 --> 21:15.920
Definitely.

21:15.920 --> 21:21.120
And I can't name names, so this is a large customer in the oil and gas industry.

21:21.120 --> 21:26.200
They make additives for additive products for oil and gas, a very global company.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.400
Sounds like this is going to be a real example.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.080
It's going to be a real example.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.720
The revenues are about $6 billion.

21:31.720 --> 21:34.560
Okay, you can Google it now and see who this is.

21:34.560 --> 21:40.800
But they came to us and they were looking to buy more gear from us and this actually

21:40.800 --> 21:44.920
is a story from three-part storage arrays that we sell.

21:44.920 --> 21:50.120
And they said they just cannot add more workload.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.400
They've been having issues with workloads that are running today.

21:52.400 --> 21:56.320
Of course, the response times have been sub-milliseconds, but they have not been able to expand

21:56.320 --> 22:03.120
the footprint and they were running VMWares, BDI, which is a virtual desktop product, which

22:03.120 --> 22:06.000
is very popular in very large companies.

22:06.000 --> 22:09.680
They actually had consultants come in from different vendors, which also I shall not name

22:09.680 --> 22:14.680
your old friends, but they had different vendors come in and there was one vendor assignment

22:14.680 --> 22:20.080
that was engaged for about months, trying to figure out what the problem was, what

22:20.080 --> 22:25.760
why they could not put more workload on these devices and why there was erratic behaviour.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.720
The people collected a lot of logs, etc. that couldn't fix it.

22:29.720 --> 22:33.400
This was the time when three-part was just coming on to InfoSight support the product

22:33.400 --> 22:38.280
itself, because like I said, it started with nimble storage, not coming on to all HB products.

22:38.280 --> 22:43.520
And so we three-part came on, we started collecting a lot of the telemetry, starting doing a lot

22:43.520 --> 22:45.760
of the analysis on that.

22:45.760 --> 22:50.560
And literally within a matter of days, we could show them, you know, it takes time for

22:50.560 --> 22:52.480
the data to come and for us to analyze.

22:52.480 --> 22:56.080
And then what we do is we show the data to our support people and we reflect it back

22:56.080 --> 22:59.080
to the customer through a portal and they could log in.

22:59.080 --> 23:02.840
And out of the thousands and thousands of virtual machines they had, they could pinpoint

23:02.840 --> 23:06.640
a few virtual machines that were behaving strange.

23:06.640 --> 23:10.160
And what happened in those virtual machines was it's a virtual desktop, so when the user

23:10.160 --> 23:14.080
logs out of it, it triggers an antivirus scan.

23:14.080 --> 23:16.760
And that takes up a lot of the resources.

23:16.760 --> 23:22.920
But to find those needles in the haystack was very hard before we had all this modeling

23:22.920 --> 23:24.680
that they plugged into.

23:24.680 --> 23:27.640
And they were able to solve the problem in as a result.

23:27.640 --> 23:28.640
But how did they...

23:28.640 --> 23:29.640
But how did they...

23:29.640 --> 23:30.640
As we wanted to sell them, but they...

23:30.640 --> 23:34.640
What specific data and what specific models allowed them to solve the stuff?

23:34.640 --> 23:38.560
Yeah, so there's lots of different models that we employ.

23:38.560 --> 23:43.640
The data that we get from, for example, from VMware, tells us on the compute layer.

23:43.640 --> 23:49.120
Now, the thing to notice, I'm talking about, we were selling storage products to them.

23:49.120 --> 23:52.640
But that doesn't prevent us from collecting data from products that are running on top

23:52.640 --> 23:53.800
of the storage product, right?

23:53.800 --> 23:56.800
The application owner at the end of the day cares whether their application is running

23:56.800 --> 23:57.800
or not.

23:57.800 --> 23:58.880
The business cares about the application.

23:58.880 --> 24:02.240
The many layers of hardware and software underneath they don't care about.

24:02.240 --> 24:05.840
So what we've decided, we will collect data from the entire stack.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.800
Because at the end of the day, we want to show you where some problems are coming.

24:09.800 --> 24:16.360
So from VMware, we collect intensive CPU data, intensive memory data, audio data to see

24:16.360 --> 24:19.560
all these little cards that are running are desaturated or not.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.480
And then we correlate.

24:21.480 --> 24:27.640
And so we have some, today, mostly supervised machine learning models.

24:27.640 --> 24:31.120
You know, we do regression analysis for some, we do classifiers for some others.

24:31.120 --> 24:34.760
We are just starting to go into unsupervised.

24:34.760 --> 24:39.760
But we correlate this data across the stack where we see what looks like a problem.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.480
A lot of these expert define as well.

24:41.480 --> 24:46.960
So over time, what we've done is when people report problems, we have gone and then labeled

24:46.960 --> 24:50.840
our data and tagged our data to show what do problems look like and then what do solutions

24:50.840 --> 24:52.840
look like.

24:52.840 --> 24:56.840
And so there's a lot of that, that modeling that we have done in the past as well.

24:56.840 --> 25:01.760
And so we are sitting on these patterns where the patterns can detect and say, this is

25:01.760 --> 25:04.200
a problem and this is what solves the problem.

25:04.200 --> 25:09.440
And so if you look at our UI, there's recommendations that we make and say, you know, your number

25:09.440 --> 25:13.480
of one recommendation is you can move this virtual machine to another resource that has

25:13.480 --> 25:18.400
excisey specification number two recommendation is you can throttle this virtual machine.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.320
So these problems on finding the needle in the haystack we're able to do because it's

25:21.320 --> 25:22.880
pattern recognition.

25:22.880 --> 25:26.120
If you were a human being going through each and every virtual machine and seeing how

25:26.120 --> 25:29.600
it was behaving, you know, it would just exhaust that.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.920
You take the two weeks.

25:30.920 --> 25:34.760
Well, not the two weeks, I think that people working on it for weeks and weeks.

25:34.760 --> 25:38.480
So it would be more of a, I would say at the scale of a year or so, because we're talking

25:38.480 --> 25:43.080
about thousands and thousands of virtual machines that these environments have.

25:43.080 --> 25:49.400
So you need to have patterns that that you can just scan through and we do it automatically

25:49.400 --> 25:50.400
all the time.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.920
You don't wait for somebody to complain and it can highlight.

25:53.920 --> 25:59.720
And so the models that you're working with, do they, you mentioned supervised on supervised

25:59.720 --> 26:05.520
and regressions and things like that, that they tend to be fairly simple, traditional machine

26:05.520 --> 26:14.760
learning, time series kinds of things or deep learning like what's the spectrum of complexity.

26:14.760 --> 26:18.840
So for the models today, they're so, they're relatively simple, you know, there's not

26:18.840 --> 26:20.480
depends on the use cases.

26:20.480 --> 26:25.160
Sometimes we do a lot of forecasting, for example, we help customers with capacity planning.

26:25.160 --> 26:32.120
And they're simple forecasting tools that we use today, we use Arima, for example, what,

26:32.120 --> 26:39.400
and then for the prediction capabilities, a supervised are, you know, regression analysis

26:39.400 --> 26:43.640
of classifiers, we do decision trees.

26:43.640 --> 26:48.160
Very simple for right now, but we have a team of data scientists that are just focused

26:48.160 --> 26:57.160
on going deeper into into the data now, yes, they are now going, they're exploring more

26:57.160 --> 27:02.440
neural networks, for example, and to see what they can get out of that.

27:02.440 --> 27:07.080
You know, initially, when we started eight years ago, we just did even simple SQL queries

27:07.080 --> 27:12.760
and pure correlations and that revealed a lot of, a lot of capabilities that, you know,

27:12.760 --> 27:15.160
nobody had done this for the IT industry prior.

27:15.160 --> 27:23.040
I'm imagining if you've got a dashboard that you're presenting to IT folks and telling

27:23.040 --> 27:29.320
them they need to go do thing X reboot the, reboot the storage array or something, probably

27:29.320 --> 27:32.800
in more detail or more fine grain.

27:32.800 --> 27:38.000
But this whole idea of explainability, like it's not just do this, it's like why, you

27:38.000 --> 27:39.800
know, you need to do that.

27:39.800 --> 27:41.400
So what degree does that come up?

27:41.400 --> 27:42.400
Right.

27:42.400 --> 27:47.600
So, you know, there's always initially people who want to be cautious, especially if it

27:47.600 --> 27:53.160
been the systems emission critical, when you tell them to do something they want to know

27:53.160 --> 27:57.200
why, you know, their jobs depend on this, if they do something wrong and the application

27:57.200 --> 28:01.960
goes down, you know, there's financial consequences of that.

28:01.960 --> 28:04.080
And but over time, people build confidence.

28:04.080 --> 28:09.720
So what we do today is, you know, predicting what's going to happen and knowing how to

28:09.720 --> 28:14.600
prevent it based on the models that you've trained in the past is one thing.

28:14.600 --> 28:19.720
But we've also gone and built because of this, there was a necessity to build automation.

28:19.720 --> 28:24.240
And so when when we do, you know, today we have, I don't know, more than there's hundreds

28:24.240 --> 28:28.360
of thousands of deployments in the field across the globe, right?

28:28.360 --> 28:30.080
And the models are running on all of them.

28:30.080 --> 28:31.360
So the scale is huge.

28:31.360 --> 28:34.640
And like I said, we don't have many people supporting that, right?

28:34.640 --> 28:38.480
So we build a lot of automation and these tools will actually then detect that something

28:38.480 --> 28:39.880
is going to go wrong.

28:39.880 --> 28:45.000
For example, they may be some memory issue that's going to happen, that will impact certain

28:45.000 --> 28:46.000
applications.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.800
So we automatically notify the customer.

28:48.800 --> 28:52.480
What we hear from our customers often is somebody called me and told me, no problem is

28:52.480 --> 28:54.840
going to happen, which I've never experienced before.

28:54.840 --> 28:58.920
It's usually me banging on the doors right and saying, there's a problem, help me.

28:58.920 --> 29:05.880
And so we notify the customer and it is very easy for them to quickly see the symptoms

29:05.880 --> 29:08.600
because we can tell them what the symptoms are.

29:08.600 --> 29:12.800
And if you tell them where to go, look, they can go look there and see it for themselves.

29:12.800 --> 29:18.200
It's just a problem that when the scales at which IT admins manage these devices, they

29:18.200 --> 29:22.440
don't know where to look, let alone beforehand, even after issues happen, they don't know

29:22.440 --> 29:23.440
where to look.

29:23.440 --> 29:28.080
So we show them the proof of the pudding, there's a little bit of information, we give them.

29:28.080 --> 29:32.720
Now the customers have built so much confidence in these predictions that we make, that they

29:32.720 --> 29:36.320
have actually asked us, since you know this with so much confidence, why don't you fix it

29:36.320 --> 29:37.320
for us?

29:37.320 --> 29:42.480
And that is actually where our vision is as HPE, we are now building capabilities to go

29:42.480 --> 29:44.520
fix these issues for customers.

29:44.520 --> 29:48.320
So once you buy the product, you put it in your data center, you have these eyes and

29:48.320 --> 29:51.760
ears and hands that are going to take care of it and fix it for you.

29:51.760 --> 29:58.400
And the reason we can do that at reasonable cost is because we've automated it, right?

29:58.400 --> 30:01.560
We're not putting people behind that.

30:01.560 --> 30:06.120
But customers do ask, initially they ask, skeptical and they do ask, but they very quickly

30:06.120 --> 30:09.240
see the credibility behind it.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.960
Because you can actually, once you know where to look, you can look and see that this is

30:11.960 --> 30:14.360
actually something that's going on.

30:14.360 --> 30:23.200
So much of transitioning through that maturity cycle, that's the way I think I did a paper

30:23.200 --> 30:29.440
on industrial AI and kind of build out this model, reflecting the way I saw folks deploying

30:29.440 --> 30:36.080
that kind of AI in industrial settings, that first they're using it to help them monitor

30:36.080 --> 30:42.240
or then they move to helping them optimize and then they move to helping them control

30:42.240 --> 30:43.560
or automate.

30:43.560 --> 30:50.000
And it's kind of a maturity spectrum and it's really the, you know, where a given company

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
is, it's all about trust, like how much do they trust the technology that do they trust

30:54.000 --> 30:58.800
AI to give them recommendations that will actually optimize what they're trying to do?

30:58.800 --> 30:59.800
Right.

30:59.800 --> 31:04.080
Do they trust that, you know, if they hand over the keys that it's actually going to

31:04.080 --> 31:06.360
fix problems before they start?

31:06.360 --> 31:07.360
Right.

31:07.360 --> 31:14.600
And so we are at that point where we tell them what to do, but we tell them very precisely

31:14.600 --> 31:18.520
because of how much we know about that environment.

31:18.520 --> 31:22.320
And they have gone, gotten to the point where they're trusting us because they're seeing

31:22.320 --> 31:27.680
when they do make the changes that we ask them to make, that it makes, it actually solves

31:27.680 --> 31:28.920
the problem, right?

31:28.920 --> 31:33.640
So the keys are in their hands now and the next stage is for us to go, they're asking

31:33.640 --> 31:36.520
us to take the keys and do the job for them, right?

31:36.520 --> 31:37.960
They don't want to drive around anymore.

31:37.960 --> 31:42.880
They just want Uber to show up and take them there.

31:42.880 --> 31:49.920
I imagine providing a rich level of detail is part of what helps create that trust.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.480
Yes and no.

31:51.480 --> 31:59.520
I think I do find that sometimes sharing other customers example, sometimes it's the brand

31:59.520 --> 32:03.560
that you have built is enough.

32:03.560 --> 32:06.000
Each customer is different.

32:06.000 --> 32:09.520
There are those that are very hands on and they like that.

32:09.520 --> 32:16.240
But there is a trend where a lot of our customers just can't scale anymore and they are more

32:16.240 --> 32:21.120
willing to trust you with making changes.

32:21.120 --> 32:26.600
You know, I saw that when I was at VMWare where we introduced this capability, which was

32:26.600 --> 32:31.200
you could take a workload and application, move it around physical resources, separate

32:31.200 --> 32:34.120
compute boxes automatically, it's called VMotion.

32:34.120 --> 32:35.920
VMotion was a big deal, huge.

32:35.920 --> 32:41.440
But I was at VMWare when before we introduced VMotion and people told us, never let you

32:41.440 --> 32:42.440
do that.

32:42.440 --> 32:45.040
How can you move a workload and look at where it is today?

32:45.040 --> 32:48.600
And the way we built that was we built a safety net around it and we said, okay, we'll

32:48.600 --> 32:52.760
come out and recommend that you should move this workload to this destination, but you

32:52.760 --> 32:54.920
will be the one hitting the go button.

32:54.920 --> 32:56.520
And they said, fine, I can look for that.

32:56.520 --> 33:00.040
They tried that and they said, well, every time it tells me I hit the go button, so I might

33:00.040 --> 33:01.320
as well let it go.

33:01.320 --> 33:05.440
And I had one customer saying, well, I will let it do it, but I'll sit there and keep

33:05.440 --> 33:07.160
watching it for a while.

33:07.160 --> 33:10.040
And, you know, I'm sure that customer is not watching it anymore.

33:10.040 --> 33:11.040
Right.

33:11.040 --> 33:13.200
So trust has to be built, yes.

33:13.200 --> 33:19.320
So this started with storage or really grew out of things that you were doing at Nimble.

33:19.320 --> 33:24.280
How, I'm trying to get how much work it is to go to the next thing, like, you know, so

33:24.280 --> 33:28.560
from one storage thing to the next storage thing is probably pretty easy, but then, you

33:28.560 --> 33:31.040
know, to servers is that, right?

33:31.040 --> 33:37.600
So actually, so our goal is to bring it out, to bring infosite capability to the entire

33:37.600 --> 33:42.040
HB portfolio and it's not going to happen over time and we don't, it's going to happen

33:42.040 --> 33:43.040
over time.

33:43.040 --> 33:45.000
It's not going to be instant.

33:45.000 --> 33:47.720
We don't want it to be instant.

33:47.720 --> 33:49.040
And so there's a, there's a two prong.

33:49.040 --> 33:54.960
Even if you had a magic wand like you and, yeah, if I had a magic wand, yes, I would,

33:54.960 --> 33:58.200
but I know I don't.

33:58.200 --> 34:03.000
If you want to be careful when you're rolling these things out, so we went from one storage

34:03.000 --> 34:09.360
to the next storage pretty quickly and we're taking a two prong approach where, you know,

34:09.360 --> 34:14.800
we talked about the machine learning models, the AI, the sort of the fun stuff.

34:14.800 --> 34:18.960
There is a less fun sounding, but very important capability, which is the infrastructure in

34:18.960 --> 34:19.960
the back, right?

34:19.960 --> 34:25.440
This data pipelines is data lakes and this ETL, there's capabilities are the data scientists,

34:25.440 --> 34:29.880
the tools that they used to just mess around and see what patterns come up and what distributions

34:29.880 --> 34:33.520
they say they just, they do their own thing.

34:33.520 --> 34:38.680
And so what we're doing is we're helping different teams build this, but leverage from our learning

34:38.680 --> 34:43.800
of what worked and did not work in terms of infrastructure.

34:43.800 --> 34:48.200
And also in terms of use cases, there are some use cases that lend themselves, they're

34:48.200 --> 34:51.080
the low hanging fruit, use cases.

34:51.080 --> 34:55.920
Each product also may have different pain points in the industry and, you know, on how they

34:55.920 --> 34:57.760
compete with other products in the industry.

34:57.760 --> 35:01.200
So we help other customers, other products find the use cases.

35:01.200 --> 35:05.080
There are some models, some automation that lend themselves pretty readily and there are

35:05.080 --> 35:08.440
others that will have to be built, definitely.

35:08.440 --> 35:12.360
So that two prong approaches, we're helping people, other products build this, but build

35:12.360 --> 35:14.720
it to our specs.

35:14.720 --> 35:19.400
And we're building actually a services oriented architecture in the back where all these

35:19.400 --> 35:24.120
capabilities that amend that go into infrastructure will be turnkey for the other products.

35:24.120 --> 35:27.640
So we will build that and then we'll say, okay, you know, product, the new product that

35:27.640 --> 35:34.160
wants to do this, this learning in the cloud for their own product, they come to us and

35:34.160 --> 35:38.280
then we give them turnkey solutions, we give them a data pipeline, we'll give them the

35:38.280 --> 35:41.800
data lake, but they can put their data, we have all the tools ready.

35:41.800 --> 35:46.080
So we're going to put this platform that they can plug into.

35:46.080 --> 35:49.840
And that's how we will, we will roll out even farther and beyond.

35:49.840 --> 35:55.920
The idea here also is one plus one equals five, right, where for the, not even three,

35:55.920 --> 36:00.840
you're going for five, that's AI, right?

36:00.840 --> 36:06.320
But the idea is you can see patterns across the board that are much more valuable than if

36:06.320 --> 36:11.120
you just showed, did correlations, for example, within your own silo, right, when the correlation

36:11.120 --> 36:15.800
jumps the silo, imagine for the application, sometimes this is all the same resources

36:15.800 --> 36:16.800
underneath, right?

36:16.800 --> 36:20.760
Be my thing, it's a sensor server, it's a storage, it's a networking device, but from an

36:20.760 --> 36:24.520
application's perspective, application owners perspective, it's all the same, that all

36:24.520 --> 36:27.360
means to end to his application, right?

36:27.360 --> 36:32.560
And but if you can correlate, you can eliminate, you know, things that look like false positives

36:32.560 --> 36:38.280
in the silo, for example, but together, they may make sense and you can pinpoint accurately.

36:38.280 --> 36:42.960
So there'll be some domain learning in each capability that will build over time, but

36:42.960 --> 36:46.520
it is lots to leverage already that's in place.

36:46.520 --> 36:52.920
So punkage, when you think about the capability that you're bringing to bear with InfoSight,

36:52.920 --> 36:57.600
and maybe even more importantly, what you're learning from engaging with customers around,

36:57.600 --> 37:06.000
you know, data and telemetry and AI and automation, how do you see that more broadly impact

37:06.000 --> 37:08.960
the portfolio at HP?

37:08.960 --> 37:13.760
So broadly, we are making our portfolio more intelligent.

37:13.760 --> 37:18.800
And we are enabling new user experiences, which were not possible in the past.

37:18.800 --> 37:26.040
And HP InfoSight is a great example of how we can do that in a data center environment.

37:26.040 --> 37:31.720
We have similar efforts going around on the Aruba side, where Aruba is bringing some

37:31.720 --> 37:35.920
of these capabilities and even more at the edge.

37:35.920 --> 37:42.320
So overall, if you look at HP's vision, we do want to bring in new experiences and

37:42.320 --> 37:49.120
intelligence to our end customers to make their life simpler so that they can spend their

37:49.120 --> 37:52.600
time on more value added activities.

37:52.600 --> 38:00.160
And they can benefit from a lot of automation, a lot of prediction, and ultimately move

38:00.160 --> 38:07.080
to this long-term vision of self-healing, self-maintaining data centers.

38:07.080 --> 38:13.320
So we are truly excited by that, and the other angle of that is we are learning a lot while

38:13.320 --> 38:19.000
we are building InfoSight, not only on the customer side, but also on the backend side,

38:19.000 --> 38:23.440
in terms of how to build these large-scale data infrastructure.

38:23.440 --> 38:29.880
And we are taking some of these learnings to our customers who are trying to solve the

38:29.880 --> 38:30.880
same problem.

38:30.880 --> 38:33.400
How do I handle large amounts of data?

38:33.400 --> 38:39.680
How do I connect my data pipeline from where I'm collecting data to where actually I can

38:39.680 --> 38:44.040
train my data to where I can infer from the model that I've trained.

38:44.040 --> 38:49.720
So we are taking that learning as well as to our customers to help them solve similar

38:49.720 --> 38:54.560
problems for different use cases in their own environments.

38:54.560 --> 38:59.480
So as an organization, as a company, we are definitely learning a lot.

38:59.480 --> 39:05.920
We are moving fast, and we are committed to enabling this vision.

39:05.920 --> 39:10.800
As you talked about, the things you're learning and the challenges that you're experiencing

39:10.800 --> 39:16.080
being reflective of the things that your customers are experiencing, more broadly, there's

39:16.080 --> 39:22.160
a move on the part of a lot of enterprises to kind of serviceize their products, if that

39:22.160 --> 39:23.160
means anything.

39:23.160 --> 39:27.640
GE doesn't want to sell you an aircraft engine anymore with the 2,000 sensors.

39:27.640 --> 39:30.640
They want to provide it as a service.

39:30.640 --> 39:36.440
Do you, and it's open to either of you, do you see IT moving in that direction?

39:36.440 --> 39:45.000
I guess it already has in a way with SaaS, but with the physical infrastructure that we're

39:45.000 --> 39:47.320
delivering to IT organizations.

39:47.320 --> 39:48.320
Right.

39:48.320 --> 39:51.640
And I can take my attempt at that.

39:51.640 --> 39:55.320
There's been a little bit of a pendulum effect, and I think we're kind of settling in

39:55.320 --> 39:59.760
the middle of that pendulum right now, where the traditional was, you own everything,

39:59.760 --> 40:05.600
you manage everything, the more control you have, the better it is for your business.

40:05.600 --> 40:09.000
And then it started to swing in the other direction, where it said, I'm going to put everything

40:09.000 --> 40:10.000
in the cloud.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.720
I just don't want to own anything on my box.

40:11.720 --> 40:17.640
I want to go to OPACs, and I'm going to sit there focused on my differentiator, and

40:17.640 --> 40:20.960
the industry started believing, well, everything is going to the cloud.

40:20.960 --> 40:25.880
And I know a lot of people in the investment banking started to believe, the other thing

40:25.880 --> 40:26.880
is going to the cloud.

40:26.880 --> 40:30.320
What's going to happen to these companies that are sending equipment for the data center?

40:30.320 --> 40:35.000
Well, now cloud has been out long enough where people have had experience with that, enterprises

40:35.000 --> 40:39.880
have had experience with that, and learn that that is not the, you know, the be all that

40:39.880 --> 40:42.480
they thought it was, and it's not going to solve all the problems.

40:42.480 --> 40:48.280
And so it's coming back to the middle where there are, they need people have decided they

40:48.280 --> 40:53.160
do need to own infrastructure, have their own infrastructure, go with a best and best

40:53.160 --> 40:56.800
of breed infrastructure, have control on it, etc.

40:56.800 --> 41:01.240
But they're also now looking at seeing how, instead of managing day to day, they can

41:01.240 --> 41:07.720
do services on it in the sense, have, pay someone, have a managed service provider for them,

41:07.720 --> 41:08.720
for example.

41:08.720 --> 41:13.600
And then managed service provider is a great model for companies like HPE.

41:13.600 --> 41:16.560
Just for the record, Infosight is given away for free today.

41:16.560 --> 41:22.200
And so what you're saying is, we will use technology to do as much management automatically

41:22.200 --> 41:24.760
for you for free customer.

41:24.760 --> 41:29.200
But there are those higher level services that we need to offer that are very contact

41:29.200 --> 41:33.760
sensitive to that customer or are very specific to their needs.

41:33.760 --> 41:38.400
And we have now very thriving business built on services of these capabilities.

41:38.400 --> 41:44.120
Now whether the SKU transfer from paying for the device and just all the way paying to

41:44.120 --> 41:45.880
services, I can't comment on that.

41:45.880 --> 41:50.440
I don't think that's in the works today, but that is more of a financial exercise, right?

41:50.440 --> 41:56.680
But the idea is, first you leverage technology to automate a lot of those things, predict,

41:56.680 --> 41:58.720
prevent, automate.

41:58.720 --> 42:01.240
And then you offer services at a higher level, right?

42:01.240 --> 42:05.760
It's an interesting question because the labor component is a big part of the cloud value

42:05.760 --> 42:12.000
proposition if you, through automation, eliminate that, that kind of impacts where that

42:12.000 --> 42:15.760
pendulum settles for a lot of organizations, I think.

42:15.760 --> 42:21.400
It's also that services, in my view, is an experience.

42:21.400 --> 42:25.440
And it is not an experience only for the IT team.

42:25.440 --> 42:28.840
I truly believe that it is an experience for the whole company.

42:28.840 --> 42:33.200
So it is an experience for the CFO, it is an experience for the CIO, it is an experience

42:33.200 --> 42:37.680
for the business in a GM, it is an experience for the CEO.

42:37.680 --> 42:45.760
And we are treating Azure services and experience addressing all these stakeholders.

42:45.760 --> 42:52.800
HP GreenLake is one of the top priorities for us, which provides us as a service workload,

42:52.800 --> 42:58.520
as a service IT in a hybrid environment, whether it is on-prem, whether it is managed service

42:58.520 --> 43:02.280
providers, or whether it is off-prem.

43:02.280 --> 43:07.520
In this hybrid environment, how can we provide this as-a-service experience to data scientists,

43:07.520 --> 43:15.000
to machine learning developers, to IT teams, to CFOs is a big focus area.

43:15.000 --> 43:21.440
And actually recently, I think four or five months ago, Blue Data joined HP family.

43:21.440 --> 43:25.760
And Blue Data is our effort to provide AI as a service.

43:25.760 --> 43:32.960
It essentially provides containers as a service, making it super easy for data engineer or

43:32.960 --> 43:39.720
a machine learning developer or a data scientist to spin off the right AI or the right big data

43:39.720 --> 43:45.360
environments in their infrastructure, and in a truly hybrid way.

43:45.360 --> 43:49.920
So we are moving in that direction where we want to provide this as-a-service experience

43:49.920 --> 43:54.280
for machine learning workloads and other workloads as well.

43:54.280 --> 43:56.520
And we are committed as a company to do that.

43:56.520 --> 44:01.160
