00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,760
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

2
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,760
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,200
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,080
My guest on the show this week is Danny Lang, Vice President for Machine Learning and AI

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,200
at Video Game Technology Developer Unity Technologies.

6
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,160
Danny is well-traveled in the world of ML and AI and has had a hand in developing machine

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,840
learning platforms at companies like Uber, Amazon and Microsoft.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,600
In this conversation, we cover a bunch of topics including how ML and AI are being used

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,800
in gaming, the importance of reinforcement learning in the future of game development,

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,440
the intersection between AI and augmented and virtual reality and the next steps in natural

11
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,760
character interaction.

12
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,040
But before we get to Danny, does anyone want to guess what today is?

13
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,800
Well, not really today but tomorrow.

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,560
And well, unless you hear this on Friday May 19th, not even really tomorrow for you.

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,440
In any case, what I'm trying to get at is that tomorrow is a very special day for the

16
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:19,440
Twimble family.

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:26,880
Yep, you guessed it, tomorrow May 20th is the one year anniversary of this week in Machine

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,280
Learning and AI.

19
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,480
I started this podcast last year as a way to share what I was learning about the field

20
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,800
and to be quite honest, I really had no idea what I was getting into.

21
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,280
But what an amazing ride it's been.

22
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,360
The amount of interest in the podcast has been incredible and I could not be more appreciative

23
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,400
of and impressed with the Twimble listener community.

24
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,560
Thank you so much.

25
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,440
We've been working really hard to be worthy of your attention by continuing to bring you

26
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,400
amazing content that you can't find anyplace else.

27
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,920
While we'd usually mention our quote contest now, which was inspired by the way by Twimble

28
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,720
listener Beth Ann Noble, I'd like to do something special this time around to celebrate our

29
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,400
birthday.

30
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,760
This week we'd like to announce a very special listener appreciation contest to honor the

31
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,600
occasion.

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,640
First prize in this contest will be a bronze pass to the upcoming O'Reilly AI conference

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,480
in New York City valued at $1,800.

34
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,160
I'll be there and I'd love to have you there as my guest.

35
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,480
Second prize is a brand new Google home powered by AI.

36
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,200
You know you can listen to the podcast on these, right?

37
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,840
And of course every entrant will win a couple of stickers, one for you and one for a friend

38
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,960
and of course our everlasting love and appreciation.

39
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,040

We'll select the winners on June 1st and announce the winners on the next show.

46
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,000
We'll have an alternate prize available for first place winners who know they can attend

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,560
the O'Reilly event, which would be of similar value as the second place prize.

48
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,920
But the details here are TBD.

49
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,680
All the contest details will be available on the show notes page.

50
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,280
So click right over or better yet, jump into your podcast app right now and leave us

51
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,560
a review and wish us happy birthday.

52
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,000
One more quick note before we get to Danny.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,400
The future of data summit was earlier this week and wow, it was really an amazing event.

54
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,880
The speakers were just outstanding.

55
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,240
Obviously, most of you couldn't make it to the event.

56
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,960
So I'm working with the interop conference to see if I can publish the session recording

57
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,640
someplace and I'll let you know if I can.

58
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,640
Okay.

59
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:08,120
And now on to our show.

60
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,120
Hello, everyone.

61
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,800
I am on the line with Danny Lang.

62
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:17,720
Danny is vice president for AI and machine learning at Unity Technologies.

63
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,000
And I'm super excited to have him on as a guest.

64
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,560
Danny, why don't you say hi to the audience?

65
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,160
Hey there and thanks for having me.

66
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Absolutely.

67
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Absolutely.

68
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,680
So why don't we start by having you tell us a little bit about your background.

69
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:40,040
You have quite an impressive background in this field having built platforms that pretty

70
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,080
much all of the places that are, or many of the places that are doing very cool things

71
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,080
with ML and AI.

72
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,400
Why don't you tell us a little bit about that?

73
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,400
Sure.

74
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Yeah.

75
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,360
I joined Unity Technologies about three months ago.

76
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:05,880
I saw gaming and VR and AR as a huge opportunity to go in and change it through AI and machine

77
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,880
learning.

78
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,080
But I think we'll talk more about that in a moment.

79
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,880
But before joining Unity Technologies, I was head of machine learning at Uber, which

80
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,320
is a complete different business.

81
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,200
At Uber, we used machine learning basically all over the company.

82
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,000
There were three really big areas.

83
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,600
One was drivers, riders and trips, where we used machine learning to give you a better

84
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,040
experience, both as a driver and a rider.

85
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:48,040
And then there's the whole map business of building maps for the Uber drivers, a lot

86
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:55,600
of machine learning there to basically convert street side imagery and other data into maps

87
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,080
automatically.

88
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:02,320
And then the last area is, of course, the famous self-driving course was involved in that

89
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,560
effort as well, a lot of machine learning there.

90
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,880
Of course.

91
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,840
And before Uber, I was general manager for machine learning at Amazon.

92
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:22,560
And it's also very, very interesting to see how Amazon really understood to use machine

93
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,760
learning all corners of the company.

94
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:33,280
I ran the elastic machine learning team, which was essentially a platform that other teams

95
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,680
could use to enable machine learning in their specific business areas.

96
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,320
So we had lots of teams using machine learning that way.

97
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,880
And before that, I was at Microsoft, I was also working on machine learning there.

98
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,880
So it goes on and on.

99
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,480
Many years ago, I spent eight years in two different startups where we were trying to

100
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,680
build virtual assistants, the ones that we know today as Alexa and Siri.

101
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:09,080
We tried to build them at that time for the earlier mobile phones.

102
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:13,680
That was pretty tough because the speech recognition at that time maybe had an accuracy

103
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,680
of 80 percent today.

104
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:17,680
What is it?

105
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
95.

106
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:26,000
So those were hard, hard times to do, to do AI because it didn't seem very smart.

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,480
We've made a lot of progress.

108
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Oh, yeah.

109
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:33,040
And so how did you get into machine learning in the first place?

110
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,800
Did you study it in school?

111
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,960
Not early on.

112
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
This is very long.

113
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,840
So long time ago, I don't want to talk about it, but I got in when I was at IBM Research,

114
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,040
my key area was autonomous agents.

115
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:55,760
So it was a lot of the vision of having software that would make decisions on its own.

116
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,260
You would let it lose, I developed what we call mobile agents and it would basically

117
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:05,520
suffer objects that could move over the internet and adapt to local environments and things

118
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,680
like that.

119
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:13,160
But it was all sort of fairly engineering heavy, engineering heavy development, we designed

120
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,560
these, we implemented them and if you had a bug in there, it would get stuck on another

121
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,880
computer and not move on and things like that.

122
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:29,360
So I got really interested in how you could make these agents more resilient.

123
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:36,840
And that's sort of where we headed today with machine learning, with concepts like reinforcement

124
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:45,400
learning and other technologies that allow these objects to learn and adapt to the environment

125
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
then.

126
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Okay.

127
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:55,680
Well, that is a really interesting topic, one that we want to dive into right now, where

128
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,440
I really wanted to go with this is, you know, we've talked about a lot of different applications

129
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,360
of machine learning on this podcast, but we've never talked about gaming.

130
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,360
And so I'm super excited to have you on to really dive into how ML and AI are being

131
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,920
used in gaming environments right now.

132
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
What's the best way to start that discussion?

133
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:22,960
Yeah, let's start out by just acknowledging that, whether it's at Microsoft or Amazon

134
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:28,360
or Uber, it's the same kind of technologies that we're using, it's the same algorithms,

135
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,440
the same concepts, yeah.

136
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,520
And you would be surprised that when you move into gaming, we again are going to use the

137
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:45,760
same technologies to bring more automation in, so to have the games optimized, have the

138
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,960
games being interacting more closely with you, it's in many ways the same approach, the

139
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,680
same technique as when we at Amazon try to basically sell you more books.

140
00:09:58,680 --> 00:09:59,680
Right.

141
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,920
It's this idea that the systems will learn from you and they will adapt is this idea that

142
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:10,960
no developer can sit down and code, a hundred lines of code, and then it knows exactly

143
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,000
how to get you to buy a book.

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,640
It's sort of the same concept that we want to bring to the game world.

145
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:26,880
So there are, I guess I would describe that world in two broad categories, there's machine

146
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,360
learning and AI that happens in-game, and then there's all the stuff that many other companies

147
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:39,920
have to deal with in terms of making people more likely to play the game and optimizing

148
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,440
selling the game and things like that.

149
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,440
Are you involved in both sides of both of those categories at Unity?

150
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,240
Exactly.

151
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,440
My job is really two jobs.

152
00:10:52,440 --> 00:11:01,320
So one part of my job is to make sure that many, many thousands of game developers can

153
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,120
monetize their games, that they can make money on their games, so that they can develop

154
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,800
more games.

155
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,080
So we support and advertisement infrastructure.

156
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:20,400
We use machine learning to optimize the ads, which is essentially bringing a game or

157
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:26,240
from one game to another game and the creator of that game then will make some money from

158
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,840
that.

159
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:32,680
And that's a classic called monetization through ads structure.

160
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:39,240
There's also in app purchases where you will spend money within the game, running campaigns

161
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:45,720
and promotions, all that is what I would call sort of very classical machine learning.

162
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:53,080
And it's super important for the ecosystem to be able to make a living from making games.

163
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,120
It's very important for our developers.

164
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,280
That's only half of the story.

165
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:05,320
The other half of the story is really when it comes to the creation of games.

166
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:14,160
And that's where AI in the gaming world means something slightly different from when I'm

167
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,640
using the word AI.

168
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,640
Okay.

169
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:24,320
So a lot of concepts in the gaming world is AI means having systems that look and behave

170
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,720
in a natural way.

171
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
Right.

172
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:34,160
There's a rule based systems that allow an NPC and a non-player character or a computer

173
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,280
agent to move around in a game.

174
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,680
And it looks a lot of reasonable, you know, sensible what it's doing.

175
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:48,440
But a lot of that is either hot wired or coded through a set of rules.

176
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Yeah.

177
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,640
Let's actually, if I can press the pause button there, this is a question that I've

178
00:12:53,640 --> 00:13:02,000
had asked before we've had, you know, in games going back to, you know, my Atari 2600,

179
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
right?

180
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,480
You have the ability to play against the computer.

181
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,960
Is that AI?

182
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,440
And you were just kind of getting at this with the rule based and others.

183
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,200
What's the difference between that and, you know, where we're trying to get to today?

184
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Yeah.

185
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,800
That's actually a good question.

186
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,880
It is, it is not what I understand by AI, but it has elements on it, yeah.

187
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,960
It implements behavior through rules or really, you know, deterministic, hot wired code.

188
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:36,680
It implements behavior that may emulate a human player, you know.

189
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,000
But I want to take that a step further, you know, that's not the way that companies

190
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:49,960
like Amazon or Uber works, yeah, when they try to sell you more products that they try

191
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:56,160
to get a car faster to you, that is basically done through the use of data.

192
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
Right.

193
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,360
That's where we want to move the game world.

194
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:07,880
We want to make sure that games learn from previous place and become more and more natural

195
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:11,040
in the interaction with the player, yeah.

196
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,600
And that's where concepts like machine learning come in, yeah.

197
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,360
I can give some examples of a particularly branch of machine learning, which is called

198
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,760
reinforcement learning.

199
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,760
Okay.

200
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:36,000
And that's essentially where the computer has this ability to randomly move a character

201
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,560
around and learn from that, what happens to that character, yeah.

202
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:49,600
So if you tell the computer that character should not get killed, it should be avoid getting

203
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:56,360
shot by the human player, then the character will over time, you know, basically learn

204
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:00,560
behavior and strategies to avoid getting shot, yeah.

205
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,400
So we basically say the character has a rewards function, which is you get punished if you

206
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:11,720
get shot or hit, and you get a plus point, you know, for every minute you survive, yeah.

207
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:19,800
So with the reason developments in deep learning, these agents are able to learn some really

208
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:29,200
complex strategies on their own that make them very, very appealing to play against, yeah.

209
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:38,720
And so if I'm a player of a game that's, you know, using an AI-based agent that I'm playing

210
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,200
either with or against, how will that feel different to me than, you know, what I've

211
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:52,000
seen with traditional, you know, automated opponents or our players?

212
00:15:52,000 --> 00:16:00,280
Yeah, the traditional systems are what we could sort of call they shallow, they implement

213
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:09,120
very simple functions, whereas with this concept of deep learning, we're able to implement

214
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,520
or the system is able to represent very, very complex non-linear functions.

215
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:27,400
So let me give some examples, when deep mind introduced AlphaGo, it, you know, it did beat

216
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:33,480
the World Champion and go, and the way it did that was basically by, you know, playing

217
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:40,360
some moves that initially looked really harmless, that did not get the opponents, the human

218
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:47,680
opponents attention, but certainly in very few moves, set the human opponent up failure,

219
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,680
yeah.

220
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:57,280
So we have seen another example of poker playing using deep reinforcement nets for,

221
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,880
for poker playing, where the system will learn to bluff.

222
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:06,480
So the big, big difference is that these systems, and I use the term deep here, they're

223
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:17,480
deep in the sense that they have a very good memory of events way back that leads, eventually

224
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,680
leads to great success.

225
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:26,240
So they become more strategic than we're used to, in some cases they become more strategic

226
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,920
that any human player would be, yeah.

227
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,800
So they're ready to run the risk like in poker, they actually run the risk of losing by

228
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:40,720
bluffing because they know that there is a bigger benefit out there.

229
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,000
And it's, and not because they were programmed to bluff every so often, but rather because

230
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,760
they've discovered the strategy through the training process.

231
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,000
That's accurate, spot on, and that's the, that's the new thing.

232
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:04,080
That's what we're able to do today, and that really changes the, a part of game development

233
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:14,000
to become more about defining the objective or the success criteria for that in PC.

234
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,760
Because let's just say that we define it as those shall not get shot, yeah.

235
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:24,400
Then the agent will really, you know, be really good at hiding, yeah, and you will get

236
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,320
really good at it, yeah.

237
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,200
Just getting away in time, every time you try to find it, yeah, that's not fun, yeah.

238
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:39,040
So what you have to do is you have to set up some, some criteria for that in PC to that

239
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:47,960
eventually will allow it to develop some subtle and complex strategies that you cannot predict

240
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:56,240
by say, but we know will lead to some very, very appealing behavior that will give, you

241
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:01,280
know, great enjoyment to play against because they are maybe hard to predict.

242
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,080
You constantly think you're about to have this agent and then they fool you, and then

243
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,120
it becomes very entertaining, yeah.

244
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:15,640
And that's what we have seen that these very deep, these deep nets, full reinforcement

245
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,480
learning can really build up these very complex strategies that, that, that, that sometimes

246
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:27,520
I saw quote from one poker player who basically stated that if he didn't know better, he

247
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:34,760
will, he would characterize that as a really like human spirit in that game play, yeah.

248
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
Yeah.

249
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:42,840
So the, I think the popular examples of, or at least the, you know, the celebrated

250
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:49,440
AI successes have been around these strategy board games like Go and Chess, to what extent

251
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:56,080
are games like, you know, your Xbox games like Halo or Call of Duty, to what extent are

252
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,880
the various agents in those games powered by something that you would think of as AI

253
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:01,880
today?

254
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,480
Uh, today they are powered by what we would call classic game AI.

255
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:13,720
So it's, it's in, uh, in, uh, in most, most of the cases that I'm aware of, it's, it's

256
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,200
very complex rule based systems.

257
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:25,360
In some cases, way, way over a thousand independent rules that have been created by the developers

258
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:33,680
who basically cover a lot of different situations, uh, very complex systems, uh, but we, we saw

259
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:41,680
a similar approach in, in anti virus, uh, programs for a long time, they developed basically

260
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:50,680
databases of rules that would identify, you know, components or elements of virus software.

261
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,680
And today all these systems have moved on, and I actually using a lot of them are using,

262
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:02,720
uh, deep learning, uh, uh, for, for training on, on, on, uh, known viruses to detect, you

263
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,080
know, new viruses.

264
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,800
And, are you aware of any particular, uh, efforts or results that have been maybe published

265
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:17,160
somewhere, uh, on, in terms of introducing AI into these types of games?

266
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,960
No, not, not in any commercial games.

267
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,880
Uh, we would, of course, you know, from unit to technology side, we would, uh, that's

268
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:32,120
one of our objectives is to, to, to offer that, uh, sometime in the future.

269
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,840
Uh, there's a lot of research going on, uh, so if we go to academia, go to the research

270
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,920
community, there's a great interest in, uh, in, uh, in, uh, in start working on this.

271
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:50,440
Uh, the, the peel is, of course, that if I can do this, if I can get an NPC in a game

272
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:57,880
to, to act in a very reasonable and intelligent, uh, and constructive way, uh, then, you

273
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,440
know, eventually, you know, maybe real robots could behave that way too.

274
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
Right.

275
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
Right.

276
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
Right.

277
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,880
So how do you, uh, as unity, how do you, uh, expect this to evolve and, uh, are there

278
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,760
a set of services that you, uh, are hoping to deliver to game developers?

279
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:24,400
Um, how do you think this evolves over time, uh, to, so that we'll see it more in games?

280
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Yeah.

281
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:36,200
It's, it's my, my hope that we can make some of these, uh, uh, algorithms available

282
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:43,360
and services, uh, essentially to enable a game developer, who is not an AI or neural

283
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:50,840
network or ML guy, you know, some DBI specialist, but basically a game developer, make a game

284
00:22:50,840 --> 00:23:00,200
developer, having a toolbox of, of, of, of AI, uh, services that they can use to train

285
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:08,760
a character, uh, and in that sense, sort of gradually enable AI in game development.

286
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,800
We have to understand that this is, this is the livelihood of, of, of, you know, our

287
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
developers.

288
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,520
This is how, how they, they make money and that's how they live.

289
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,520
Yeah.

290
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,520
They develop games.

291
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:23,400
So what we want to do is we want to give them these tools that allow them to create

292
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,960
maybe, uh, you know, maybe make it more efficient.

293
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,280
They can create some games faster, they can create games that are more entertaining,

294
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,040
uh, et cetera, yeah.

295
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,480
Uh, so we want to make that available so that it can sort of gradually be, be, be, be

296
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,800
adopted and we can also learn from the use, nobody has really done this very much yet.

297
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Yeah.

298
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,440
So we don't know yet how, how it's going to work in practice.

299
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:53,400
In some ways, there's, uh, it strikes me that there's a precedent for this and that game

300
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:57,480
developers aren't typically physicists either, but it's very common for them to work with

301
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:01,760
these physics engines nowadays to develop their games, no?

302
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,760
That's correct.

303
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,560
Uh, we, we have, um, we have actually done some, uh, studies where we are using reinforcement

304
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:16,560
learning to have characters learn how to move in a world where there's gravity and friction,

305
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
yeah.

306
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:23,760
Uh, and, uh, and inertia and it, it's kind of interesting to see how, how a character

307
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:31,120
can learn, uh, you know, to, to walk or run or jump, uh, without, uh, knowing it from

308
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,120
the outset.

309
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:38,640
But by basically attempting, you know, tens of thousands of times, you know, and over

310
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:45,240
time, you will figure out the pattern of movements, uh, to jump, for instance, yeah.

311
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,400
And in that sense, you know, we, uh, we act to using the fact that we can, we can simulate

312
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,760
gravity, simulate friction and inertia in the physics engine.

313
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
Okay.

314
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,280
Um, you know, one question that I've had about the application of reinforcement learning

315
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:07,680
to games is, I guess when, when we think about machine learning in general, and I don't

316
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,240
believe that reinforcement learning, uh, is a common exception to this, you've got kind

317
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,560
of your two separate stages, you've got your training stage and your inference stage.

318
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:26,840
Um, but in a game environment, I imagine part of the appeal of AI is so that the, the

319
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,960
agents in the game can learn from the game as it's happening, right?

320
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,840
So not during a training phase, but during the, the actual playing phase.

321
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,720
Uh, how is, how does that, um, you know, is that, uh, we've talked about on the show

322
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:47,120
active learning, which may be a part of this, but is there a specific name for that?

323
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,880
And, uh, how is it commonly done today?

324
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,880
Yeah.

325
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,200
Um, you're absolutely right.

326
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Yeah.

327
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
That's where I would love to go.

328
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,800
I would love to go, let me, let me give some crazy, crazy examples yet.

329
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,800
But imagine that, uh, say that you are playing your Pokemon, Pokemon go, yeah.

330
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,800
Right.

331
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,920
I have to train your character, yeah, today the training of that character is just, it's

332
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:17,440
not really anything, yeah, you just click a few times and, and that's how you train

333
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,440
it.

334
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,440
Yeah.

335
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,800
But imagine that you are actually training that character to battle and you could train

336
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:29,600
it for half an hour or one hour and that you are actually teaching and reinforcement

337
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,480
algorithm behind the character, yeah, in real time.

338
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:39,280
And if you're really good at training it, it may beat the, some other, uh, person's character,

339
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,320
yeah, who is not that good at training it.

340
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
That's one thing.

341
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:50,160
The other thing is that if the game can learn through gameplay, then it can learn, uh,

342
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:56,640
about you and just like Amazon and Netflix, uh, they basically tailor everything you

343
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,240
see to, to you, I mean, if you go to Netflix, what you see is different from what I see,

344
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,120
yeah, it's tailored to you.

345
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:09,760
What if every game in that sense was tailored to you, yeah, if, if the game knows that you're

346
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:16,000
only happy if you progress fast through the levels, then let's make it easy to progress,

347
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
yeah.

348
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,840
But if the game knows that I'm sort of more rigorous and I want, you know, to fight hard

349
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:28,440
from get to level to level, then, um, then that's a different, different approach, yeah.

350
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,760
What if games could adapt?

351
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,840
Oh, that's really interesting.

352
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,360
I'd be happy if the games could know that, uh, you know, whenever I'm playing Call of Duty,

353
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:42,120
I'm hiding in this particular corner and make it a little bit less easy for me to just

354
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,320
camp out there and snipe on people.

355
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,800
Exactly.

356
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Yes.

357
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:54,880
You mentioned that one of the, one of the motivations for you joining Unity was, uh, what

358
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,400
was going on in terms of augmented and virtual reality.

359
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,160
Can you talk a little bit about that and how, where you see the intersections between

360
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,360
AR VR and AI being?

361
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Yeah.

362
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:12,360
Now, if you think about a game, as you know, today being, it's very controlled environment,

363
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,360
yeah.

364
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,400
I can, I can hard code the game.

365
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,200
I can add AI to the game, but it's a very controlled environment, yeah.

366
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,200
Right.

367
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:27,400
We start moving into VR and AR, we start having, you know, a lot more flexibility.

368
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,480
So let's take, take VR a bit.

369
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Yeah.

370
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,400
Now I, I, I emerge into a game.

371
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,960
I can now, you know, move around in the game and I can, you know, I can pet the characters

372
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
in the game.

373
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,960
I can touch them.

374
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:40,960
Right.

375
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:48,720
And when I do that, the bar moves up for what I consider naturalness.

376
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,720
Yeah.

377
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,400
I may play a game on a phone and I can see the characters are not, you know, they are

378
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:57,000
characters and they are a bit artificial in their movements, yeah.

379
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:04,480
When I put on my goggles, I, I want to get immersed into this, this new world, yeah.

380
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,520
And things have to act in a very natural way with me.

381
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,000
Otherwise, the illusion breaks and it's not really fun.

382
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Right.

383
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,840
Take that a step further in augmented reality, the, the game, or should we call it the

384
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,760
app, because you can be way more than games, yeah, let's write the app, yeah, needs to

385
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:30,880
sort of connect between myself and the surroundings, yeah.

386
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:36,360
And those surroundings can now be anything, yeah, I, I don't know, you use this app.

387
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,600
I don't know where you're going to use it.

388
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,520
I don't know what's going to be there.

389
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:46,360
So you see the bar goes up constantly up where you can no longer imagine, you know, a thousand

390
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,520
lines of, of code being the answer to everything.

391
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,520
Right.

392
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,720
And that's where you need to have AI really come in, yeah.

393
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:02,240
And that, that is, is, is, of course, an area where we can, we can make a big change

394
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,240
through AI.

395
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,600
Clearly, I think that makes a lot of sense.

396
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,880
The user expectation is dramatically increased because you want this environment to be immersive

397
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,920
and engaging and feel lifelike.

398
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:21,400
And so it only makes sense that you'd have, you're interacting with Intelligent Things

399
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,400
if they're, you know, beings.

400
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:30,760
Do you expect the, the AI techniques that we use to do this to, you know, be the same

401
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:34,960
kind of things that we're applying every place else, or these, they're going to be a new

402
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,640
set of techniques that come into play when we start talking AR VR.

403
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:46,160
I think it's going to, initially, is going to be sort of the same technologies, but I want

404
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:52,320
to say one thing here, which is when we do talk about this of VR and AR, that we're able

405
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,480
to push the boundary of AI much, much further here and much faster.

406
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:06,960
Now, if I'm building a self-driving car, I, I have to be very careful how far I push

407
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:16,600
the boundaries of AI, AI, because it's, it's a 2,000 pound or more object that may actually

408
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:23,960
kill people if I'm not, you know, understanding what I'm doing as a machine learning on AI

409
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,080
expert, yeah.

410
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,200
So you need to really put a lot of boundaries in.

411
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,160
When you build an industrial robot, it's the same, yeah, it needs to build a car, but

412
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:42,760
it should not hit the operator around it, so it has a lot of hardwiring taking place.

413
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:52,600
When you move to VR and AR, I'm like, how, you know, how bad can it be, how can you make?

414
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:59,800
So you can really push the boundary there, yet you create a complete, you know, believable

415
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,400
world, yeah, at the same time, yeah.

416
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,120
So, so you give people this experience and you can push the boundaries of AI to its

417
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
very limits.

418
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,000
And if you go over, people take the goggles off and say, no, that was really bad, you

419
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,240
know, that was not believable, yeah, right, yeah.

420
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,240
And that attracts me a lot to this space here, because when you sell books or you get

421
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:32,040
taxes around, you are to a great extent limited by the physical world, right, right.

422
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,960
Now we can, we can really play tricks with the physical world.

423
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,640
And if those tricks they fail, we didn't really kill anyone.

424
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:52,200
Have you seen any interesting implementations or early results in marrying AI and ARVR?

425
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,280
We have done some experiments.

426
00:32:55,280 --> 00:33:00,800
I think that this is, this is still emerging technology.

427
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:07,160
There's a lot of things around VR and AR that has not yet really been tried out and not

428
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,560
yet fully understood.

429
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
Sure.

430
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:19,640
But I think that very quickly creators of games and apps in AR and VR are realizing that

431
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:24,600
they're going to have to step it up a bit, because people expect that natural interaction,

432
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
yeah.

433
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,240
So in, in many VR apps and games today, you can, you can pick up an object and you

434
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,840
can maybe throw it, yeah, but you would love that same interaction with other virtual

435
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,200
characters or non-person characters in those games, yeah.

436
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,200
Right.

437
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,040
And you really like to interact with them.

438
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,800
And you want to interact with them in your way and they should be able to respond in

439
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:53,240
a natural and not, you know, some uncanny way.

440
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,720
And I think we still have some way to go there.

441
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,720
Right.

442
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
Right.

443
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,920
Instead of a summary of that one bucket, which is the in-game experience and NVR, AR

444
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:10,040
experience, is it, it's just super early and you guys are experimenting as are a lot

445
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:16,160
of people, but, you know, we're still far from, you know, Call of Duty X, whatever the

446
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:21,920
next version is, being a fully AI enabled game.

447
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:24,680
Yeah, that's for sure.

448
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:30,440
The part we're trying to play there is to enable the basic technologies so that our game

449
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:36,280
developers can start playing with it and sort of evolve it and help us understand what

450
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,080
works and what does not work.

451
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:49,520
And so how about in the other bucket, where you're applying ML and AI to, you know, more

452
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,600
for, from a business perspective, what are some of the results that you've been able

453
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:55,600
to achieve there?

454
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
Yeah.

455
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:02,840
So by basically understanding what kind of games people play, just like what kind of

456
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:06,680
movies you watch and what kind of books you read, you'll be able to understand what kind

457
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:16,360
of games you play, you're able to pinpoint what's better recommendations or ads for other

458
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,360
games.

459
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Yeah.

460
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:23,200
So you will, you will, if you always play single shooter games, we, you know, probably

461
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:29,440
who it would be best off showing you some trailers for other single shooter games, yeah, right?

462
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,400
But that technology is in there that Amazon, that Netflix has been very good at technologies

463
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,880
that basically start exploring your interests, even exploring the things that you maybe

464
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,440
don't even know yet that you're actually interested in.

465
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,760
So basically using machine learning to better get to know you and your game preferences

466
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:59,840
and make sure that you can discover those games, because there's so many, many, many games

467
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:06,320
in the app store, yeah, on Google Play, that, so many games that you can't possibly find

468
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,440
all the games that you actually really like, yeah?

469
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:19,080
So we'll basically learn over time what your preferences are and find those games for

470
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,680
you.

471
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:31,560
But have you found challenging in applying these technologies at Unity?

472
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:35,600
And for that matter at previous organizations, what, you know, what are the challenge patterns

473
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:40,640
that you come up with when you're trying to introduce this or mature it any given organization?

474
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,640
Yeah.

475
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:48,880
Yeah, that, whether that is Amazon, Uber or Unity technologies, that it's the same all

476
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:56,320
the way around, and that is that you should not need to be a machine learning expert or

477
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,200
an AI expert to accomplish this.

478
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,200
Right.

479
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:08,840
You should be able to say, my problem is selling more shoes or selling more books or getting

480
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:17,840
taxes on time, therefore I should be able to use machine learning services to get there.

481
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,840
Right.

482
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,840
So I thought about it at Amazon, but basically creating as a platform.

483
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,960
We also launched the Amazon machine learning system.

484
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,240
We launched that on Amazon Web Services for the public to use.

485
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,880
And that is very powerful because now you get people with real business problems.

486
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,560
People with real incentives to improve their business using these technologies which

487
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:52,040
are ways superior to any attempt of trying to write, you know, a thousand lines of C++

488
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:57,600
code or whatever to solve the problem, yeah, basically based on that data, they can train

489
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,480
computers to do a better job, yeah.

490
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,760
So in all these organizations, it was a matter of making it available in a meaningful way.

491
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,720
And that's what I'm doing at Unity too, is to make sure that game developers do not

492
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:17,120
have to have a PhD in machine learning to benefit from it.

493
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,120
Right.

494
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,920
What lessons have you learned in building these machine learning platforms at Amazon, Uber

495
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,400
and now Unity?

496
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:35,480
The lesson, this one big lesson learned which is that it just works really, really well.

497
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,480
Uh-huh.

498
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,360
So make it just work?

499
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:45,760
But no machine learning does work really well because it does provide results, period.

500
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,320
And there may be a lot of talk about it, there may be a lot of talk about deep learning.

501
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,840
Some people call it hype.

502
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,040
I'm like, yep, you can call it hype, you can call it whatever you want.

503
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:04,320
But the proof is there that we are able to improve business where we move from a concept

504
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:12,600
of trying to analyze and investigate and implement to a world where we basically use the data

505
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,320
to improve the business from learning.

506
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:24,600
And whether that is selling books, driving taxes or developing and playing and selling

507
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:30,280
games, machine learning is, it really works.

508
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:38,560
You've been talking to different groups about the notion of bringing machine learning to

509
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,520
every corner of your business.

510
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,840
And to me that suggests not just the obvious places, but maybe some interesting places.

511
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:54,640
Do you have any stories or examples of interesting corners that you have been able to bring

512
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,600
machine learning and where you found interesting or surprising results?

513
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:11,120
Yeah, I would say that you often run into business problems.

514
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:16,960
If you're selling shoes, one of your key business problems is that people get a shoe

515
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,360
online, ordered online, they get a shoe and doesn't fit.

516
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:26,240
The machine learning is one of these wonderful things where all the return data, all the

517
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,520
shoes that did fit and all the shoes that did not fit.

518
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:37,480
If you use that data, you can start predicting how different shoes, shoe brands, do they run

519
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:44,760
large, do they run small or they spot on, you can even start predicting what shoe size

520
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:53,240
a customer has, and you can basically use that to give a better shoe purchasing experience.

521
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:58,920
To me that's kind of a surprise, I didn't really think about shoes, but that's when you

522
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,560
enable machine learning into a non-machine learning environment, you will see business

523
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,600
problems popping up.

524
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:13,240
Another one is, imagine I've seen this being used, I won't be specific, but where machine

525
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:23,640
learning is used within HR to basically complement one day, maybe even replace performance reviews

526
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:32,720
and things like that, to predict, to analyze resumes and predict which candidates may be

527
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,800
good and strong future employees.

528
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:45,680
So areas, it's sort of to me because I've always been on the platform side of this, I get

529
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:56,640
surprised almost if not daily but then close to daily on what people are using this for.

530
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:05,640
And that is really what matters, it matters, let's enable a lot of people to use this technology.

531
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:11,080
So in order to make that vision real, how do you build the right relationship between

532
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:17,480
the platform people, the data science people, the business people, so that you can kind

533
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:23,680
of build capacity as an organization that uses machine learning effectively?

534
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:36,160
Yeah, you need to avoid making this a very custom effort for every single team and for every single use.

535
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:41,600
That's what it traditionally, that's where it came from, you would have a team that would

536
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,320
have a business need, you would hire data scientists, you would hire machine learning engineers,

537
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,720
you would implement proprietary algorithms and you would maintain those and then you would

538
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:56,440
need to hire more people as your business scales, et cetera.

539
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:05,280
And one thing that I did at Uber was to build a machine learning stack from the ground

540
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:14,840
up entirely based on open source and define it, build it and define it as a platform.

541
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:19,960
So what I find over the years is that a lot of team come and say, I need this feature,

542
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:25,000
I need that feature, this is very important, this is very important for me, I need this

543
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:31,560
other feature, which is even more important for me, well, that's the wrong mindset, because

544
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:38,040
what they need to do is they need to deploy a lot of machine learning models across their

545
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:44,160
business rather than just fixating on one particularly one, and I have often seen this

546
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:52,080
in, say, in fraud detection teams, they would have some very custom algorithms detecting,

547
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:57,400
you know, certain kind of fraud, and I sort of compared to, you know, you have five locks

548
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:01,360
on your front door, but you leave all the windows open, yeah.

549
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:09,400
So these very customized solutions, I think should be something of the past, because

550
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:15,040
using open source, using standardized algorithms is so much more efficient.

551
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:21,160
So rather than one magic model, deploy 10 or 50 or 100 different models, right, on your

552
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,160
business.

553
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:28,880
Can you speak at all to the specific open source tools and projects that you use to build

554
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,360
that platform at Uber?

555
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:36,600
Absolutely, it's all public, there are slides around if you Google it, but it's essentially

556
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:48,920
a Hadoop HTFS, Hadoop Spark, things like MLLIP, XG Boost, an open source, very, very versatile

557
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:58,480
open source algorithm from University of Washington, things like Faye, TensorFlow, Kafka

558
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:05,800
for streaming, Cassandra for structured data.

559
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:16,120
You can get really, really far with all those tools combined without any need for really

560
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,360
a deep customization.

561
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,480
And so the platform you built was something that made all of these available, and did

562
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:31,160
you put some kind of layer on top of it for visualization or automation or how did

563
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,600
you pull all of these disparate tools together?

564
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:45,080
Yeah, both at Amazon and Uber, the key contribution was essentially a defining, you know, a really

565
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:53,920
sorted SDK, so people could programmatically integrate with that system, a nice and easy

566
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:01,320
to use graphical user interface, web-based, browser-based interface, again, because we

567
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:11,040
want a wide range of users to not feel that the barrier of entry is too higher.

568
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,720
And then, so really the user interface, the SDK side, that's how to access the systems.

569
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,000
And then, at the other end of it, you need to have the system being able to easily access

570
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:30,120
the data of the company, so you need to integrate on the data side into the data repositories

571
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:37,200
of the company, whether that is existing, data warehousing, data lakes, you know, relational

572
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,520
databases, etc.

573
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:49,800
So the stack is really something I would say is not, the stack itself is not as important

574
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:54,840
as long as it works and runs, but it's sort of that integration on both the front end

575
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:59,880
and the back end into the business, that's important, because that lowers the barrier

576
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,880
of entry.

577
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:07,000
It makes it easier for you to build a model if you don't have to track down data from

578
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:13,360
outside your team.

579
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:20,520
On the front end of that was the primary user experience like IPython notebook or Jupyter

580
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:28,040
notebook rather, or were there different ways that developers access the system?

581
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:36,680
Yeah, there was a total custom user interface, there was also, actually, you could also basically

582
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:44,400
use things like Jupyter notebook, as long as the system has IPython SDK, you can move that

583
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:51,800
integration very quickly, and now run your model building jobs from Jupyter, you can

584
00:47:51,800 --> 00:48:00,520
visualize stuff, you can deploy from Jupyter here, so I personally I love Jupyter notebook,

585
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:06,520
I think it's an incredible tool, a custom user interface, fine too, but most of all

586
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:15,800
lecturers is the SDKs in multiple languages are important because that allows back-end

587
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,840
engineers to easily integrate machine learning into their offerings.

588
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:29,560
So if you take the mobile app at Uber, when you open the app app, it suggests one or two

589
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:37,760
or three likely destinations that you normally go to, that piece, that was actually a piece

590
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,400
of machine learning right there, using your data to build models that predict where you're

591
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,760
going to go on a given day of the week at a given time.

592
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,760
Interesting.

593
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:55,520
Well, when we spoke previously, you talked a little bit about your vision for really

594
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,840
fully autonomous corporations, what does that mean and what do you envision there?

595
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:09,040
Yeah, if you follow me on thinking that we can use really deep reinforcement learning

596
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:18,640
to train an NPC or a Go player, a poker player, yeah, if we can train a computer to use

597
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:26,680
really deep and complex strategies, including bluffing, if we can train it to do that, then

598
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:35,440
we can probably also train an agent to say sell books or sell movies, yeah, and become

599
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:41,960
better and better at it, yeah, I mean like in the end, it should become the best book-selling

600
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:48,600
agent in the world, yeah, and you can take that further and say, well, the point for

601
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:53,160
instance, let's just take an example, not only which book should I try to sell, but what

602
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,960
should the prices be?

603
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:55,960
Right.

604
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:00,120
Imagine that you use reinforcement learning to figure out what is the right price to sell

605
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:07,560
stuff at, yeah, and what is the right time to order books at so that we don't run out

606
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:12,160
of book for logistics reasons, yeah, when should we order the parts to build, you know,

607
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:18,560
our Xbox, our Kindle, our hardware, yeah, if you look at a lot of, you know,

608
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:28,160
problems that humans are solving in corporations today, I think many of those problems can

609
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:37,000
be learned and solved by a computer, if you take reinforcement learning, deep reinforcement

610
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,480
learning as we know it today as a starting point, and basically just think a little out

611
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:45,640
there, why not?

612
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:50,200
Right, right, yeah, I think what's interesting about that to me is that we often think

613
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:59,040
about this AGI artificial general intelligence as this kind of one Uber AI that, you know,

614
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:06,120
it's just very human-like and can reason and, you know, do everything, but you're describing

615
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:13,120
a, you know, something that could create tremendous value that is, you know, much less ambitious,

616
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:20,080
right? It's a collection of, of, of AIs that are more purpose built, and we should be able

617
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,000
to get there, you know, a lot quicker.

618
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:29,800
Yeah, I, I, I, I'm kind of struggling with the whole AGI debate, sort of maybe, you

619
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:37,040
know, plus one or plus two out there for me, but I do think that there is an interesting

620
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:44,360
perspective in, if we envision a world where reinforcement learning, I'm using that as

621
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:48,720
sort of a very general term here, yeah, but there will, you know, be many different variations

622
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:57,400
of it, but we do envision a world where a company like Amazon used that, not, you know,

623
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:07,400
to selling books, not just in 10 places, but they use it 5,000 parts of their company,

624
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:13,440
yeah, they use it everywhere, right? And you start having these systems interacting,

625
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:24,080
you know, at one point, when you add it all up, you get more than the sum, yeah, because

626
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:30,480
now you're going to get the effect of, I'm in really good at selling, I'm really good

627
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:37,040
at finding the right price point to maximize revenue, I'm really good at understanding

628
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:43,920
what people want, I'm really good at understanding ordering all the parts and components in time,

629
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,800
so that I never run out, et cetera, et cetera, and something you have sort of a whole product

630
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:58,400
pipeline happening, yeah, with very limited human intervention, yeah, is that a GI? I

631
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:03,360
don't think people think of that, but is that looking like a super intelligent corporation?

632
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:11,880
Yeah, yeah, it strikes me that there's a whole field of study and research that would

633
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,080
need to happen to allow us to manage this thing, like apply, it's almost the application

634
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:23,000
of traditional control systems work to these independent AI systems, like hysteresis,

635
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,840
so you don't over or under order or order to aggressively, or it's just a whole layer

636
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:32,280
that needs to happen there that we're clearly, yeah, not there yet.

637
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:38,440
Yeah, I totally agree with that observation, and I also think that, and we start seeing

638
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:48,520
this in some papers coming out, I do see a shift in some research that now goes more towards

639
00:53:49,720 --> 00:54:00,360
researching the strategy around teaching computers, yeah, so basically examples are like if I give

640
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:05,960
a reinforcement learning algorithm, give it too hard of a problem to begin with, it's not going

641
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:12,920
to solve it, yeah, but if I sort of give it, you know, increasingly difficult problems to solve,

642
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:20,040
it gets really good at it, yeah, so that's kind of learning strategies, and so we're not talking

643
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:23,720
about, we're not talking about the technology here, we're not talking about, you know, this

644
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:28,360
particular structure of a deep neural net or something like that, we're just talking about

645
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:34,520
how do I best teach a computer, and their company is looking at how can I minimize the

646
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:39,800
need for data, because data can be, you know, difficult to get by, so there's a way I can,

647
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:47,160
I can learn more efficiently, so if you think about some of these research topics are kind of

648
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:53,000
at a meta level, yeah, so far we have been so eager to study algorithms and methods,

649
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:59,400
but maybe a lot of the future research is really about what, what does a good school for

650
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:06,280
computers look like, interesting, interesting, well as we wind down any parting thoughts or words

651
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:16,200
for our audience, I think that the audience should look at the gaming and the gaming platforms as

652
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:25,960
a fantastic lap for AI that's going to give us a peek into the future, because if you think about

653
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:35,000
NPCs moving around in a game, you know, they are really robots, yeah, robots in the physical world,

654
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:41,000
they take, you know, easily year to two years to build, yeah, and they're expensive, very expensive,

655
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:48,200
lots of mechanical engineering, yeah, but if you think about an NPC in a computer game,

656
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:54,680
that's pretty much the robot too, you can evolve them quickly, you can try out different, you know,

657
00:55:54,680 --> 00:56:03,880
dimensions, different mechanisms, everything can happen at, you know, surreal speeds, yeah,

658
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:11,800
compared to the real world, so I think that the way I look at the gaming world is way beyond gaming,

659
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:16,920
I'm looking at it as like what is going to be possible in the physical world, you know,

660
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,320
five, ten years from now, well that may be possible in the gaming world next week.

661
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:28,280
Hmm, that's awesome, that's great, great. All right Danny, well thank you very much for joining
