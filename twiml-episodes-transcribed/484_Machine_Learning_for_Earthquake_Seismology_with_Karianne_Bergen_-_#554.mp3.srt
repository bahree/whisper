00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,400
All right, everyone, I am here with Cariann Bergen.

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,400
Cariann is an assistant professor at Brown University.

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,520
Cariann, welcome to the Twimal AI podcast.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,280
Hi, thanks for having me.

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:25,040
I am looking forward to diving into our conversation.

6
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:31,120
You have roles in both data science and earth sciences

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:35,840
at Brown, and we'll be talking about that and more.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,960
But to get us started, I'd love to have you share a little bit

9
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,680
about your background and how you came to work

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,040
and the confidence of those two fields.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:48,480
Yeah, so I actually am back at Brown.

12
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,560
I was an undergraduate here a few years ago,

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,360
and I studied applied math and physics.

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,080
And at the time, I was studying applied math

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,400
because I thought, I really liked math and, you know,

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,160
in high school and I had taken computer science

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,240
and I really liked these kind of topics.

18
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,400
And I thought, math is really useful.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,240
So it'll be fine.

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,880
It's a great thing to study.

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,760
But I'd never heard the term data science.

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,640
Like, I didn't know that it existed.

23
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,920
I just was like, math is useful.

24
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,160
It's everywhere.

25
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,640
So I studied applied math.

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,600
And then I graduated and went to work

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,200
at MIT Lincoln Laboratory, which is a federally funded research

28
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,760
and development center outside of Boston.

29
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,040
And there I was doing, essentially I came in.

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,600
I had an applied math degree.

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,600
And they were like, have you ever heard

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,840
of any of these neural networks support vector machine

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,360
and I had, because I'd taken unapplied statistics course

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,680
that covered these things.

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,400
And so they gave me this sort of applied machine learning

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,760
project trying to look at data from different sensors

37
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:48,280
and try to determine if there had been a bio agent release

38
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,320
or this kind of thing using sensor data.

39
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,160
And the job title that I had was software engineer.

40
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,200
But I was like, this doesn't feel like software engineering.

41
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,800
I'm kind of prototyping analysis and algorithms in MATLAB.

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,840
And so then I decided to go back to school

43
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,360
after that.

44
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,760
I'd never considered doing a PhD.

45
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,080
But I wanted to do kind of an interdisciplinary

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,680
more application-focused or sort of engineering-oriented

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,480
applied math kind of program.

48
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,080
So I went to Stanford.

49
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,280
And then once I got to Stanford, I

50
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:19,080
started to hear about data science everywhere.

51
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,880
And I originally thought I was going to do more of like

52
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,000
the, I was in the program that's called computational

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,240
mathematical engineering.

54
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,040
So that's kind of traditionally has been more like scientific

55
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,600
computing and computational sciences.

56
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,280
But there was a big shift toward data science.

57
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,760
So I went to Stanford.

58
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,200
Everyone's talking about data science.

59
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,800
If you're doing applied and computational mathematics,

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,600
the natural place to apply that is in data science

61
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,320
and machine learning.

62
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,160
So I ended up kind of moving more in that direction

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,760
than I had anticipated.

64
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,360
Again, I'd never heard of big data data science

65
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,640
until I went over to Stanford.

66
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,200
And then it was sort of everywhere.

67
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,760
And while I was at Stanford, I got

68
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,160
interested in doing these more applied problems.

69
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,680
Because I do think it's a really interesting way

70
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,560
to find challenging data science problems

71
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,120
as to go talk to scientists or other people who have data

72
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,200
and don't know what to do with it.

73
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,240
They have a problem they want to solve,

74
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,680
but they don't quite know how to get the solution.

75
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,600
And so just by a sort of chance, I

76
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,200
mentioned that as an undergrad, I had taken

77
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,720
a handful of our science courses.

78
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,200
And I thought they were interesting,

79
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,680
but I didn't really see the connection

80
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:26,280
between our sciences and the kind of mathematics and computing.

81
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,640
But I mentioned this to Professor.

82
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,880
And she introduced me to a seismologist

83
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,840
who had a lot of data.

84
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,080
And so we started collaborating on this project

85
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,880
that ended up becoming my PhD thesis

86
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,720
about trying to detect really small earthquakes

87
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,280
in really long duration waveform recordings

88
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,160
from seismometers, which are the sensors

89
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,360
that measure vibrations of the Earth.

90
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,480
And so I'm trying to pick out really, really small earthquakes.

91
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,080
And so that kind of got me into this feel

92
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,640
of the intersection of data science and geophysics.

93
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,080
And then I sort of continued on in a postdoc position

94
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,000
and ended up applying to faculty positions

95
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,440
and ended up back at Brown, where

96
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,880
I was hired by the Data Science Initiative, which

97
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,680
is one of these kind of interdisciplinary homes

98
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:16,200
for data science at Brown, with a joint appointment

99
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,680
in Earth, Environmental, and Planetary Sciences,

100
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,600
which is a different department than the one I was in here

101
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,520
as an undergrad, but it was kind of fun to come back.

102
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,760
My opinion is Brown undergraduates are the most fun

103
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,560
and greatest undergraduates in the world,

104
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,560
the best ones to work with.

105
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,520
So I was excited to come back and teach them

106
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
and work with them again.

107
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,000
And so I was excited to come back to Brown.

108
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,880
I also have a courtesy appointment in computer science.

109
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,680
So I hopefully will be able to start working

110
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,120
with some computer science students as well.

111
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,120
I just started this year.

112
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,400
So I'm still new to Brown.

113
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,920
But yeah, it's fun to be back.

114
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,440
Fantastic.

115
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,720
Do you anticipate continuing on?

116
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,680
Well, I guess you're partially appointed

117
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,720
in Earth and Environmental Sciences.

118
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,360
So you're going to continue on with research building

119
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,320
on your dissertation.

120
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,120
Is that the idea?

121
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,400
Yeah.

122
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,640
So there's definitely one aspect of the research

123
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,440
that I'm going to continue to do.

124
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,320
I have some collaborations that are hopefully,

125
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,960
it's a little tricky during the pandemic

126
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,040
to keep these collaborations with scientists going

127
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,920
and kick off new ones as a new assistant professor.

128
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,760
He started during transition institutions during this time.

129
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,320
But hopefully to continue collaborating

130
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,000
with people who are doing earthquake science,

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,840
I have a current project I'm working on,

132
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,080
where I'm trying to work on a similar problem,

133
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,720
which is also this kind of waveform classification

134
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,800
and classifying the data that are recorded by seismograms.

135
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,760
But trying to do so in a way that's a little more interpretable.

136
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,560
So I do have interest in those kind of projects.

137
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,640
And in general, sort of signal processing event detection

138
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,040
and sensor networks are problems that I've worked on.

139
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,120
Actually, that's what I was doing.

140
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,800
Also at Lincoln Laboratory was a problem

141
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,720
with detecting sort of rare events in a sensor network.

142
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,520
I'm doing kind of the same with earthquakes.

143
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,880
So that's an area of interest.

144
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,920
But also moving more towards looking

145
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,480
at other kinds of applications and thinking more about,

146
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,160
how do we do machine learning through in the right way

147
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,800
and the sciences and developing tools

148
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,480
that are specifically designed for scientists

149
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,840
as opposed to kind of taking techniques from industry

150
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,320
and adapting them, which is what I did during my PhD.

151
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,040
We were using these kind of audio processing techniques,

152
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,080
applying it to seismic data, and sometimes that works.

153
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,720
But sometimes scientists need tools

154
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,080
that are specifically designed

155
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,280
with their sort of domain expertise, knowledge

156
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,360
of this sort of underlying, you know,

157
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,320
domain knowledge, the physics, and all of that as well.

158
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,200
So there's a lot of I think needs that scientists have

159
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,160
that are not necessarily being addressed

160
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,280
by some of the research that's going on

161
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,680
that's more industry focused in many cases.

162
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,240
But digging into the work that you did on the dissertation,

163
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,600
you mentioned you were applying audio techniques

164
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,320
or techniques from audio processing,

165
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,440
were they machine learning techniques

166
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:07,440
or traditional audio processing techniques or a mixture?

167
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,000
Yeah, so it's kind of a mixture.

168
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,600
So we were doing trying to detect the signals

169
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,360
from these weak earthquakes in a sort of unsupervised way.

170
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,600
So in a lot of science applications,

171
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,680
I think the sciences in general

172
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,440
is common to have really big data sets,

173
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,600
but you don't always have like labels for them

174
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,200
or very good set of labels.

175
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,640
And especially if your goal is to find something new,

176
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,080
then, you know, the label data

177
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,680
you have may not be helpful for finding

178
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,080
and discovering new things in the data.

179
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,400
So we wanted to develop something

180
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,680
that we would be able to discover new earthquake signals

181
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,920
in these continuous data sets

182
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,000
without having to have a lot of labeled data.

183
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,360
And this continues to be a need in this field

184
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,520
because label data is something

185
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,000
that people often don't have.

186
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,120
And so we were using more of a data mining approach.

187
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,240
So we are trying to look for repeating patterns

188
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,520
in the data as a way of picking out earthquake signals

189
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
because earthquakes often repeat.

190
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
When I started the project,

191
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,800
I didn't realize the seismograms.

192
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
You see, if you've ever seen one,

193
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,880
they're like, look at these kind of wiggles.

194
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,200
And to me, I thought they just were really random.

195
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,200
I didn't know that there is a lot of information

196
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
that's sort of in there.

197
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
But if you have two earthquakes

198
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,040
that are roughly the same location

199
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,520
and they're recorded by the same instrument,

200
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,440
then the wiggles that are recorded for that,

201
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,840
they look almost identical.

202
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,840
And so you can use that as a way to pick out earthquakes.

203
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,640
If you know what one of the signals looks like,

204
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:27,240
you can essentially use that as a sort of template

205
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,680
and find other events that were roughly the same location.

206
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,000
And so that's called template matching

207
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,440
and that's a commonly used approach in that field.

208
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,720
So we were trying to do template matching

209
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,960
without template sort of template discovery

210
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,360
by looking for these kind of repeating signals.

211
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,560
And so we were using techniques that you would use

212
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,440
for like audio retrieval

213
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,400
because the waveform data we have in seismology,

214
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,560
the sort of best or most similar kind of data

215
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,040
that's out there that there's been a lot of tools for

216
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,880
is audio.

217
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,960
There's obviously some differences between the two types,

218
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,480
but sort of searching large audio data sets

219
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,800
for you know sort of repeating segments

220
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,080
is something that there were techniques.

221
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,520
And so we were using in particular localities

222
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,200
instead of passing was the technique

223
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,960
we were using to kind of cluster

224
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,360
and find do kind of a near neighbor search

225
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360
to find similar waveforms.

226
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,120
And then another piece of it is,

227
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,800
then a piece that's different from audio

228
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,760
is then what do you do when you have multiple sensors

229
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,800
at different locations?

230
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,800
And so that was a big focus of my work.

231
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,520
And so with that's again under the hood,

232
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,160
there was some sort of machine learning going on

233
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,880
like some basic, you know, some clustering,

234
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,960
these kinds of things.

235
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,480
But yeah, it was kind of an interesting project

236
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,480
just because it was really combining a lot of different

237
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,880
tools and really, it was a very, very, you know,

238
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,600
multidisciplinary and really fun.

239
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,160
We had a team of people from,

240
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,640
I was sort of the data science person

241
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,480
and we had some seismologists involved.

242
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,000
We had some computer scientists involved as well.

243
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,080
So we had people from, you know,

244
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,040
three different academic units all involved in the project.

245
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,680
So that was good and fun.

246
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,840
Well, when you mentioned that the signal,

247
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,840
if you record two seismic events from the same location,

248
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:18,360
the signals will be identical as the implication

249
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,800
that if you're in a different location

250
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,720
that the signals won't be identical

251
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,720
and that kind of speaks to me to some of the challenges

252
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,360
of using machine learning, you know,

253
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,000
might be that you can train a model,

254
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,440
but it's very location specific

255
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,040
and doesn't necessarily generalize to other locations.

256
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,720
Is that one of the things you see?

257
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,840
Yeah, so for this particular project,

258
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,040
it is true that so the reason why you would see similar

259
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,200
signals that are coming from events

260
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,880
that have the sort of same or close nearby sources

261
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,440
and then recorded at the same location

262
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,360
is that essentially the source is the same in that case

263
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,800
because you have sort of slip along a fault

264
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,480
at roughly the same location.

265
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,680
Then you have the seismic waves

266
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,600
are traveling the same path

267
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,120
and then they're recorded at the same location.

268
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,280
So everything's kind of the same

269
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,640
all of these pieces that contribute

270
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,800
to what the waveform looks like,

271
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,120
but if you have a different location.

272
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,320
I thought you were referring to multiple earthquakes,

273
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,960
you know, separated by time.

274
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,120
Captured from the same location.

275
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:20,960
Oh, yeah, they are,

276
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,360
but if they might be having at the same location

277
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,200
along the fault.

278
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,640
So they would be separated by, you know, minutes,

279
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,840
years, you know, the amount of time

280
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,360
could be pretty much any amount of time.

281
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,040
We were processing data sets up to 10 years.

282
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,960
So up to 10 years of time,

283
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,520
we would look for those,

284
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,160
but they would have to be roughly

285
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,600
at the same location and recorded at the same instrument.

286
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,720
But in terms of generalization,

287
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,880
now they're actually in the last,

288
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,960
I would say about three years,

289
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,440
which is around the time I finished up my PhD.

290
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,560
There has been a shift

291
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,520
toward using supervised approaches for this.

292
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,480
And there are general characteristics of earthquakes.

293
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,880
So you have this sort of initial wave arrival,

294
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,960
which is called a P wave

295
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,000
and then you have another sort of major arrival

296
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,240
called an S wave.

297
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,360
And you have all these different,

298
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,800
they call them seismic phases.

299
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,080
And so you can see these,

300
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,880
they have some patterns in the data

301
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,880
that seismologists can learn to identify them

302
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,600
by looking at the waveform data.

303
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,600
They can look at some of these seismic recordings

304
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,960
and they can say, okay, that's a P wave,

305
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,680
that's an S wave and all that.

306
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,440
So you can also train a machine learning model to do this.

307
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
If you have a large labeled data set,

308
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,120
which that's something that,

309
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,440
as a student, I was frustrated by

310
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,600
because there weren't these large

311
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,960
labeled data sets in this field.

312
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
And I kept saying,

313
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,880
if we want to use supervised learning,

314
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,320
then we are going to have to put together

315
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,240
this kind of data set.

316
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,400
And so a few years ago,

317
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,400
there was sort of a push for that to happen.

318
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,000
And now there are some of these data sets.

319
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,280
And so there has been a movement towards supervised learning.

320
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,360
And it does work fairly well.

321
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,960
They do tend to generalize well

322
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,000
from different locations

323
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,760
because you do have these kind of general,

324
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,960
like P wave and S waves patterns

325
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,360
that you can train a seismologist to pick them out.

326
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,200
So training and machine learning algorithm

327
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,920
is, it's very feasible to do.

328
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,320
But this only works for the kind of earthquakes

329
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,840
that we have a lot of examples of

330
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,360
in the catalogs and more conventional earthquakes.

331
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,920
There's still a lot of demand for

332
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:22,320
these more unsupervised or kind of data limited methods

333
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,000
for other kinds of events.

334
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,120
So there's lots of different kinds of seismic events

335
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,800
that people are interested in.

336
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,840
There's things like tremor,

337
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,880
which is another kind of sort of seismic event.

338
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,120
People also study environmental events,

339
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,840
like those study ice quakes or landslides

340
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,080
or avalanches, these kind of things.

341
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,800
And there's also seismometer on Mars.

342
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,680
So if you're trying to, you know, this,

343
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,840
you can train a model to detect earthquakes on Earth.

344
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,160
But if you try to apply it to Mars, like, you know,

345
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,000
all bets are off, and that's a case

346
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,520
where you don't have a lot of examples.

347
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,400
You don't really know what you're gonna find.

348
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,280
So there are, you know, there's,

349
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,520
there has been this movement towards supervised learning,

350
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,720
but it's only for those cases

351
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,640
where you can put together a large label data set.

352
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,320
But it does, it does work well for those problems.

353
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,760
Do we call them earthquakes if they're on Mars?

354
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,760
You would call them probably a Mars quake, I guess.

355
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,000
I don't know, I haven't looked so much at the,

356
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,400
I've seen some of the data for it,

357
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,720
but when I look at it, it doesn't look like anything to me.

358
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,120
I've sort of learned, I've learned, you know,

359
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,320
I'm sort of a human, I've done my sort of human machine,

360
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,680
you know, learning and learned how to identify,

361
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,480
sort of P and S waves and pick out earthquakes.

362
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,800
But if I look at the Martian ones,

363
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,000
it doesn't look like anything to me,

364
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,320
which is why I don't think machine learning

365
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,800
would be able to pick them out either

366
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,200
if they were trained on Earth.

367
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,080
And so you mentioned that an as an element

368
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:44,080
of your project was trying to incorporate data

369
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,480
from multiple locations.

370
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,240
Yeah, so what I was trying to do is one of the challenges

371
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,080
with our approach of trying to look for repeating signals

372
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,600
is that other things can generate repeating signals.

373
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,240
Like if you have the same truck

374
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,360
that drives past the sensor every day,

375
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,960
then you may get a repeating signal from that.

376
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,360
And so there's kind of two places

377
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:07,360
where you can try to suppress those kinds of false detections.

378
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,520
And one of them is kind of on the front end,

379
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,960
you can try to choose features where you're not going to see,

380
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,520
you know, maybe that's not in the right frequency range

381
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,640
or something that don't look like earthquakes.

382
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,440
But you also can try to do it on kind of the output side

383
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,040
and say like which of these signals are consistent

384
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,520
with being an earthquake.

385
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,200
And one thing that you can try to do

386
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,720
is use machine learning to classify those.

387
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,120
But actually what works best is to look at the physics

388
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,240
and say are we seeing something that's consistent

389
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,280
with a single event where you have a waveform propagating

390
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:38,520
in space and it's being recorded on different sensors

391
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,400
in a way that's consistent with a shared event.

392
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,040
And so that's a problem that generally when you do detection

393
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,840
in this field, you first pick out what you think are earthquakes

394
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,120
and then you look at different sensors

395
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,360
and say are we seeing the same event.

396
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,960
But the waveforms they arrive at different stations

397
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,800
at different times because they travel,

398
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,640
they don't travel instantly.

399
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,440
So they hit the stations at different times.

400
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,160
You actually try to make sense of this

401
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,680
and like are these arrivals we're observing

402
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,240
at different locations consistent with a shared event.

403
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,280
And that problem is something they call phase association

404
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,120
in this field.

405
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:14,880
And so for our particular detector,

406
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
one of the parts of the project that I worked on

407
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,800
there's been a lot of time on was trying to come up

408
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,440
with a method to do that for multiple stations

409
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,720
for our particular approach.

410
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:28,120
And it turns out that because we're doing our detections

411
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,080
we're identifying similar events,

412
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,680
there's an invariant quantity we can use

413
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,680
to that we see across the network

414
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,600
that we can identify and pull them out.

415
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,480
So the problem just actually sort of reduces

416
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,040
the problem of finding these kind of patterns

417
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,400
in a giant sparse matrix, which was the output

418
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,640
of our detector.

419
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,480
And so kind of doing this like clustering,

420
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,640
finding these kind of specific cluster shapes

421
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,480
and patterns in this matrix.

422
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,600
And that technique or you mentioned location invariant

423
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,000
hashing, is that what you call that?

424
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,120
So sorry, locality sensitive hashing is a technique

425
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,840
from like theoretical computer science

426
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,720
for fast near neighbor search.

427
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,800
And so that's what we use to pick out the waveforms

428
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,400
that are similar to each other.

429
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,680
And then once we do that for each of the instruments

430
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,160
in our network, then we have to ask the question of like

431
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:19,440
which of these pairs of events that we are seeing

432
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,960
do we believe are real and that we're seeing

433
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,960
at multiple stations?

434
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,320
Because we see it in multiple stations

435
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,160
and we think it's probably not just like a truck driving

436
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:30,960
by one station or some other sort of nuisance signal

437
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,400
we think it's really an earthquake

438
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,760
if it's consistent with being observed over a larger

439
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,840
spatial area.

440
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,120
And so does the technique result at,

441
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,440
is it a technique that an analyst or someone

442
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,320
could apply or would apply to the data

443
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,480
to help them make sense of it?

444
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,560
Or does it feed into some machinery

445
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,080
that you, like a classifier that ultimately says,

446
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,520
this was an earthquake, this wasn't an earthquake?

447
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,960
Yeah, so our approach is essentially

448
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,920
trying to just detect the signals.

449
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,440
So usually if the processing steps,

450
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,600
what a seismologist would ultimately want

451
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,440
would be to get a catalog of events.

452
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,720
And so what they would usually do

453
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,040
is take the events that are seen on multiple stations,

454
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,320
they would try to then use, look at,

455
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,240
identify the specific arrival times

456
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
that each station of the P and S wave

457
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,600
so these different phases.

458
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,720
And then use that to try to locate where the event is

459
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
and if you can sort of locate the event,

460
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,640
that's when it's usually kind of put in a catalog

461
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,840
and you could also characterize it,

462
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,960
like how big was the event?

463
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,000
What was the magnitude, maybe information

464
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,240
about the source and so on?

465
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,360
So that's kind of what the next step

466
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,320
would be to locate and characterize the event

467
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,920
and then put it in a catalog.

468
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,560
And these catalogs are used by,

469
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,280
this is sort of the starting point of a lot of research

470
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,240
in geophysics and earthquake sciences.

471
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,840
They want to have good catalogs of earthquakes

472
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,840
so that they can then look for patterns

473
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,520
or draw conclusions based on when and where

474
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,360
they're seeing earthquakes and these kinds of things.

475
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,720
You know, the people who are sort of trying to study

476
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,600
like the physics of earthquakes and these kinds of things,

477
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,960
they need to know where and when earthquakes happen.

478
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,640
So on my end, I'm trying to help create

479
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:12,880
that sort of data product for the scientists.

480
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,640
And how would you characterize kind of where we are broadly

481
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,640
with the application of machine learning to the field?

482
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,680
Well, this particular problem of identifying earthquakes

483
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,680
and seismological events and more broadly to earth sciences.

484
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,480
Yeah, so this particular problem

485
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,800
of doing this sort of waveform classification,

486
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,480
this kind of seismic data analysis,

487
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,120
it's really on kind of the front end

488
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,920
of getting these catalogs.

489
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,080
This is one of the problems that's,

490
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,520
it's been studied for a long time.

491
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,040
And it's also one of the areas I think within geophysics

492
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,360
where there's been a lot more focus

493
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,640
on applying machine learning

494
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,200
because it's a problem that seems really well suited

495
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,000
to machine learning.

496
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,800
Like you have all of this data,

497
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,320
you have some catalogs for some kinds of events

498
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,840
and you want to be able to do better

499
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,040
to do a better job of picking out the earthquakes,

500
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,800
identifying when the arrivals are,

501
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:13,080
getting the smallest events that we can and so on.

502
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,040
And so that area I think there's been,

503
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,440
there has been a lot of work on it.

504
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,320
And I think it's actually starting to get incorporated

505
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,160
into some of the like real time processing.

506
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:25,440
So the tools that I was developing was more for researchers.

507
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,240
So it was more geared towards like batch processing

508
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,200
of large quantities of archive data.

509
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,000
So we would apply it to like the last 10 years of data

510
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,520
recorded in a particular region or set of stations.

511
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,440
But there's also people who are like the US Geological Survey

512
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,320
that are doing this kind of real time catalog generation.

513
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,600
And so we were trying to develop,

514
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,920
you know, more detailed catalogs for researchers.

515
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,280
But there also was an interest in like,

516
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,000
well, if we could just incorporate it into these kind of systems

517
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,880
that are already generating the catalogs then

518
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,680
and have better catalogs in the first place,

519
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,720
I think that's an area where there is a lot of interest

520
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,760
in including machine learning.

521
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,960
One of the challenges there is just, you know,

522
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,760
the USGS is public facing, right?

523
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,160
So I think there are a little more,

524
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,240
you know, risk averse in terms of like what,

525
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,640
what how many, you know, false positives can you put

526
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,200
or how accurate you need it to be

527
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,560
as opposed to the catalogs researchers are working with.

528
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,720
You know, they want to find everything they possibly can

529
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,480
and then worry about later kind of some of these other issues

530
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,640
about like the data quality or these kind of things.

531
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,480
So.

532
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,760
And so from your introduction,

533
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:39,760
it sounds like your experience applying machine learning

534
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,960
to this particular field of seismology kind of in form.

535
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:51,440
Some, you know, some thoughts on kind of machine learning

536
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,840
in general as applied to the scientists.

537
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,920
You know, how do you think we're doing there?

538
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,800
Yeah.

539
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,680
So actually when I finished up this project,

540
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,440
one of the things that I did was,

541
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,880
as I was writing up my thesis,

542
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,600
I like had all these kind of thoughts about like,

543
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,680
well, how could machine learning,

544
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:11,400
how could scientists better incorporate machine learning?

545
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,880
And I sort of wrote this up and we ended up publishing

546
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,920
like a review paper that include these kind of suggestions

547
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,800
for the scientific community.

548
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,240
But at the same time, I was kind of thinking about

549
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,320
as a data scientist, like what do I see is sort of missing here.

550
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,440
And I think right now there's a lot of focus like among scientists.

551
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,920
There's a lot of interest in using machine learning.

552
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,120
But for scientists, machine learning is just a set of tools

553
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,920
that they don't necessarily,

554
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,480
I mean, some of the, you know, younger scientists

555
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,800
are really keen to learn more computer science

556
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,680
to learn the data science techniques.

557
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,240
But a lot of people are just sort of like,

558
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,200
you know, give me this, you know, neural network,

559
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,280
I'll just apply it to my data, get some results,

560
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,640
and then, you know, move on,

561
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,200
they're really motivated by the scientific questions.

562
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,320
And not necessarily thinking about like, you know,

563
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,680
how do I modify this technique to get it to work better

564
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,480
or is this technique, you know, well suited to the problem

565
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,520
or how could I incorporate domain knowledge better

566
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,360
into this model?

567
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,080
It's, you know, it's just, it's not the focus of their work.

568
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,280
They're just, you know, they want a set of tools

569
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,000
that they can kind of grab and go.

570
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,640
And on the, I think, computer science side,

571
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,320
a lot of the research there is driven by,

572
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,920
you know, the needs of industry

573
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:18,360
and certain kinds of data like text or images

574
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,240
and these kinds of data sets,

575
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,200
which often look different than the data sets

576
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,640
that scientists have.

577
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,120
And often there's sort of different assumptions

578
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:31,120
about, you know, the needs and just the interest

579
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,240
of scientists, I think, is often a little bit different.

580
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,160
You know, things like knowing how confident

581
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,240
they could be in their predictions,

582
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,720
being able to interpret models and understand,

583
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,360
you know, what's going on under the hood

584
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,440
is something that's really important for scientists

585
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,520
being able to use whatever machine learning models they have

586
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,200
to then discover something new about science

587
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,960
is really the, the ultimate sort of focus.

588
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,360
And so I think there's not a lot as many people

589
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,960
who are in this kind of, in between space,

590
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,240
there's kind of the scientists who are using machine learning

591
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,800
tools but not focused too much on developing new tools

592
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,840
and then you have computer scientists who, you know,

593
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,520
they might be interested in applying their tools

594
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,400
to scientific data but not necessarily really digging

595
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,640
into like learning more about the domain in order

596
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,960
to make really like tailored tools for the scientists.

597
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,640
And so I sort of think of it as a little bit of an analogy

598
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,200
with like computational biology.

599
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,000
You have this field where you have people

600
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,240
who are essentially a sort of trained as computer scientists

601
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,920
but they really learn a lot of the biology

602
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,760
and then they're able to develop tools specifically

603
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,000
for working with biological data

604
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,680
for solving computational problems in biology.

605
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,400
And I think for our scientists and for some

606
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,920
of other, the other physical sciences,

607
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,520
we don't really have that notion of this

608
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,080
as kind of a distinct discipline

609
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,280
that we're training students in and have

610
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,600
as its kind of own research field.

611
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,440
And so that's what I'm kind of hoping to work in that space

612
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,320
and to try to build up and train students to work in that area.

613
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,160
But it's kind of a new and growing area

614
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,920
and you know, fields like computational biology took time

615
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,200
to sort of grow and develop.

616
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,840
And I think, in our sciences, I think we're a little behind

617
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,600
but there are some areas I see a lot of work

618
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,480
in like climate science where I think they're really far ahead.

619
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,200
There's a lot of people who've been doing climate modeling.

620
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,840
I think they're really computer savvy over there

621
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,040
and like a lot of them are keen to adopt machine learning.

622
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,560
Geophysics is also a very sort of,

623
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,800
I was a geophysics is full of data scientists, you know,

624
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,920
from before we were calling them data scientists.

625
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,720
Like they've always had a lot of data,

626
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,840
a lot of very high demand for computational solutions

627
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,480
for analyzing big data sets.

628
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,280
But the focus hasn't always been on, you know,

629
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,800
looking to sort of modern tools from computer science.

630
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,280
A lot of us sort of brute forcing things

631
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,680
like just throwing a lot of compute at the problem

632
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,960
and not thinking about how to, you know,

633
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,520
carefully design the algorithms

634
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,160
or really digging into the different statistical

635
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,200
or sort of computational methods as much.

636
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,680
Of course, there's always, there's always people

637
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,640
in every field who have these interests.

638
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,680
So I'm not like the first person who's ever,

639
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,080
ever been in this intersection.

640
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,320
But I think it's an area, there's a lot of growing interests.

641
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,960
I hear from a lot of, you know, young scientists,

642
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,440
early career folks who were interested

643
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,720
in going into this area.

644
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,840
And so it's an area that I'm hoping to develop more

645
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,280
in my research, rather than kind of focusing on

646
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,320
like this one particular problem of picking out earthquake signals,

647
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,480
which is an interesting problem.

648
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,680
But I think there's a lot more that we could do

649
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,120
in this intersection, especially developing new tools.

650
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,520
Like I think that's kind of the most, the most fun.

651
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:36,320
And do you have a sense for the direction that that goes

652
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,520
or specific tools that you think are needed?

653
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:44,320
And maybe how domain specific are the new tools?

654
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,200
Do you think there's an opportunity to create, you know,

655
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,400
ML tools, you know, broadly for scientists?

656
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,840
Or does that run the risk of kind of the same problem

657
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,080
that you're trying to solve

658
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,240
and what the tools aren't specific enough?

659
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,840
Yeah, I mean, I think that's a good question, right?

660
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,720
Because there is this sort of tradeoff, like the more kind

661
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,080
of general purpose tool you make, like the more different problems

662
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,000
you can apply it to and get like decent solutions.

663
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,480
But then for any given problem,

664
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,800
it's probably not going to be the best possible solution.

665
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,600
So I think, but there are kinds of data,

666
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,480
like I've been working with these, you know, seismic signals.

667
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,080
And there aren't as many tools out there,

668
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,560
for instance, for doing time series and signals.

669
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,480
Like a lot of it is coming from like the audio processing

670
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,600
community and some things that you, you know,

671
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,280
use for other kinds of sequential data,

672
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,520
like text you could apply to this, you know,

673
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,360
these kinds of data.

674
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,440
But maybe it's not it's natural to do it.

675
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,080
And so you can think about, you know, you could,

676
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,560
there is a need, you know, for just general tools

677
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:45,160
for signals and time series, more work in that area.

678
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,640
But then, you know, so that's kind of a more general area

679
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,520
that people could contribute in.

680
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,440
But at the same time, then it's not specific

681
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,200
to these kinds of specific, like, you know, earthquakes

682
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,480
and the seismic networks and all that.

683
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,960
So there is, I guess there's kind of a trade off that,

684
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,560
you can risk getting too far in either direction, I guess,

685
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,960
making something too general.

686
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,840
But I'm hoping to kind of be in that space of thinking,

687
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,960
like when I'm thinking about stuff,

688
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,600
even if I'm applying it to seismic data,

689
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,880
I try to think, like, could this be applied more generally

690
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,400
to other kinds of signals or time series?

691
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,280
And that's often when I read papers, I think, like, you know,

692
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,520
is this a method, like, could we adapt this to work for,

693
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,920
you know, if it's designed for images

694
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,560
or for other kinds of sequential data?

695
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,240
Like, would this work for signal processing?

696
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,680
What it worked for time series analysis?

697
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,040
Because those are kinds of data you see a lot,

698
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,360
or sensor networks of other sorts, right?

699
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,960
There's a lot of different time series

700
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,720
where you have multiple sort of sources

701
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,560
where you're recording them, multiple sensor locations.

702
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,680
And so, you know, a lot of times the relationship,

703
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,960
this sort of spatial relationship

704
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,720
between those may be different in different applications.

705
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,800
But I think there's still, you know,

706
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,720
there's still potentially insight

707
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,440
from one problem that could be applied to the other.

708
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,600
So, I don't really have a good answer to that problem.

709
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,640
Like, it is, is a spectrum, it just depends,

710
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,240
like, you could get really specific

711
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,440
to a particular problem or to general

712
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,880
so that you're not solving anyone's problem.

713
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,880
As a new faculty, you know, with a new lab,

714
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,880
you know, charting a direction through questions like that,

715
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,400
how do you approach them, where do you start?

716
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,280
So, I've been trying to, I have some sort of areas

717
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,320
that I'm interested in where I think they're, you know,

718
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,320
are contributions that we could make for kind of,

719
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,320
I try to think like could this,

720
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,720
is this seem like something that could help

721
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:34,800
or scientists in general, but not always for a specific task?

722
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,600
Although I often apply it to seismic data

723
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,800
and then kind of show it to my seismology colleagues

724
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:44,000
because it's a fun to talk to them about these things.

725
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,120
But for instance, like right now,

726
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:48,640
there's some of the areas that I think are really useful

727
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,480
for scientists.

728
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,440
One is like just getting back to this problem of like,

729
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,480
well, how do you do learning

730
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,800
when you don't have very many labeled examples?

731
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,480
And for the method I developed as a PhD student,

732
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,320
we sort of assumed you had no knowledge

733
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,680
and you are no examples.

734
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,440
And then you had to sort of bake some domain knowledge

735
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,760
into your solution, but there's also, you know,

736
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,680
you could also do like semi-supervised techniques.

737
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:13,320
There's a lot of techniques using, you know, some labels

738
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,000
and also using domain knowledge.

739
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,080
So I think there's a lot of opportunities there

740
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,640
in different scientific areas.

741
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,040
I'm also interested in one area that I'm interested in,

742
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,000
recently is looking at sort of interpretability

743
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,760
and kind of explainable AI methods

744
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,600
because I think now that a lot of geoscientists

745
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,840
are throwing deep learning models at their solutions,

746
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,920
you hear a lot of people talking about like,

747
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,760
well, how do we, this is a black box.

748
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,160
They don't like that it's a black box.

749
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,800
Because scientists, they don't like black boxes.

750
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,440
And the goal, if your goal is ultimately

751
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,960
to discover something new, then just having

752
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,920
some kind of a black box solution

753
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,400
where you, you know, feed in an input

754
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,360
and output something isn't very satisfying to scientists.

755
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,120
So having tools that they can use to better interpret

756
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,080
the models, one, to just, you know,

757
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,360
one case maybe to understand the representations,

758
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,480
the model is learning, because that itself may be the thing

759
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,320
that we don't know.

760
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,840
Like, we don't know how to model something.

761
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,640
We can train a neural network to model it.

762
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,720
And now we want to understand like,

763
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,360
what did it actually learn?

764
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,840
And the other case, and this is more

765
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,680
for the kind of routine seismic processing example

766
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,800
is you may want to be able to, you know, interpret the model

767
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,680
to make sure that it's doing something that makes sense, right?

768
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,560
You want to be able to trust that your model

769
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:27,000
is making predictions that you're willing to trust

770
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,560
and that you think are correct, especially when you start

771
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,800
some of these seismic applications, you know,

772
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,160
earthquakes are natural hazards.

773
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,680
And so there's a lot of ways in which, you know,

774
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,880
these, the decisions that your machine learning algorithm

775
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,000
is making starts to get close to kind of making decisions

776
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,080
that relate to, you know, public messaging

777
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,400
or putting out warnings about things to the public.

778
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,040
And so then you really want to have confidence

779
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,440
in what your solutions are doing.

780
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,160
And also for those applications, you do have a lot of,

781
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,000
you do have some cases in which analysts

782
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,480
are looking at the data and actually reviewing

783
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,800
all of the earthquakes and events that are coming in.

784
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,920
And so you also want tools that are going to help them

785
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,600
understand what's going on, you know,

786
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,080
where they should focus their attention.

787
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,960
So that they're, you know, when they have to like review

788
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,000
all of this, it's a lot of data to manually process.

789
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,240
We have tools to automate it,

790
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,800
but then you need something kind of bridge that

791
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:23,360
and help point them to like, what are the strange cases?

792
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,680
What are the cases where the model isn't really sure

793
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,960
or, you know, how can we sort of combine

794
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,560
both the analysts, expertise and the modeling?

795
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,960
So there's a lot of different places

796
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,200
where I think there's work to be done for this particular problem,

797
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,280
but also just as kind of a general set of tools

798
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,440
being able to interpret machine learning models

799
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,000
is going to be useful for scientists.

800
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,680
That's an area I'm kind of been focusing on recently

801
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,240
and excited about.

802
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,640
Awesome, awesome.

803
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,320
When you're out talking to scientists

804
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,320
that are, you know, familiar with machine learning

805
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,320
in the sense that they know it's something

806
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,640
that could potentially help them,

807
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,440
but not, you know, necessarily trained in machine learning.

808
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,760
What are the questions that you get most frequently?

809
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,160
Yeah, so I think there's, I think scientists,

810
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,000
I think it's different like five years ago than it is now.

811
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,240
I think now a lot more scientists are generally familiar

812
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,400
with machine learning, whereas when I first started working

813
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,560
on this stuff, or even I would say as recently

814
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,680
as like four or five years ago,

815
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,760
there were a lot of people who are just like,

816
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,760
what is machine learning?

817
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,880
I don't quite know what it even is.

818
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,240
I think now the questions actually get the most

819
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,680
when I talk to people, I mean, sometimes they're like,

820
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,080
you know, does this make sense for my data set

821
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,840
and they kind of, you know, tell you about their problem?

822
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,920
And usually they don't have enough labeled examples.

823
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,720
They're like, is 20 enough in those kind of things?

824
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,200
But the other thing, the big question is often,

825
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,080
how do we teach this to our students?

826
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,320
Like what skills do our students need?

827
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,920
You know, what should, what classes should we be requiring?

828
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,280
What statistical skills or computing skills

829
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,320
should we be teaching them so that they can like learn

830
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,080
to do this, or even, you know,

831
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,240
if they decide to leave academia

832
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,280
and go into a job and industry,

833
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,960
like how do we train them so that they learn

834
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,240
the data science skills because it's not something

835
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,760
that's incorporated into sort of,

836
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,280
at least at the undergraduate level

837
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,360
in most universities into like a geology major

838
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,400
or like environmental science type major,

839
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,880
these kinds of programs,

840
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,800
the students aren't necessarily learning these skills,

841
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,240
but I think there's growing recognition

842
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,520
that it's, you know, computing and data science

843
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,760
are important in these fields

844
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,160
and that students need to be learning it.

845
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,120
So that's actually, I think the most common question

846
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,160
recently that I got is just, you know,

847
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,800
what should we be teaching our students?

848
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,160
How do we train them to do this?

849
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,600
How do you tend to answer that?

850
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Is it just yes, you train them in the stuff or?

851
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
Well, I tend to, well, I mean, I tend to say, you know,

852
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,640
I think students should, you know,

853
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:51,000
I think we should, you know, all undergraduate,

854
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,120
my opinion of a verb to me,

855
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:54,040
I would have all undergraduates take a statistics class

856
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,200
in a linear algebra course

857
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,200
and then learn like Python or something.

858
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,360
But I think it's still something

859
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,560
where for a lot of science majors, it, you know,

860
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,680
those kinds of courses, like they still have to take calculus

861
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,560
and maybe there's a statistics requirement

862
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,560
but they often don't have to take any computing

863
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,560
necessarily a lot of the students are learning these skills

864
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,920
but they're learning them informally,

865
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,080
like they'll do a research project with a faculty

866
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,320
and they'll kind of pick up how to do some like MAT lab coding

867
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,440
or are whatever language is being used in the lab.

868
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,000
But they're not, they're kind of picking it up as they go

869
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,760
and I think some of the students are missing this

870
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,040
and especially also the formal math training,

871
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,160
like they see it in their physics courses,

872
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,720
they'll see a little bit of linear algebra

873
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,160
and they'll see a little bit of statistics

874
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,520
that come up in their other science courses

875
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
but they're not getting the sort of level of training

876
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,640
that I think they need to really dig

877
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,520
into some of these machine learning techniques,

878
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,240
like they're learning how to enough to, you know,

879
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,360
be able to, they can probably run, you know,

880
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,280
a package like Scikit learn on their data

881
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,640
and I teach the students in my class how to use it

882
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,680
but if they really want to start then, you know,

883
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,720
developing new tools that are, you know,

884
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:00,120
tailored to their specific application

885
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,440
that are incorporating domain knowledge into it

886
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,240
a little bit more rather than using a tool out of the box,

887
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,520
then they really need that mathematical background

888
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,920
and that's something that I think some of the students

889
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,520
who are sort of keen on that are getting,

890
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,640
like they're learning it on their own,

891
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,960
they're signing up for those courses

892
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,880
but it's not, it's not something that's kind of standard

893
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,640
in these fields yet.

894
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,200
Well, Karen, thank you so much for joining us

895
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,880
to share a little bit about what you're working on,

896
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,680
best of luck with your new lab

897
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,160
and looking forward to seeing lots of great stuff

898
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,360
come from your and your team.

899
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,680
All right, yeah, thank you so much.

900
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,680
It was nice to have you.

901
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
