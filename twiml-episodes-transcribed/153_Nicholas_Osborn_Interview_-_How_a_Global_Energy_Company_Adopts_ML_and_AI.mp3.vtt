Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

00:16.320 --> 00:21.480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:21.480 --> 00:35.000
I'm your host Sam Charrington. A few weeks ago we celebrated the podcast's second anniversary

00:35.000 --> 00:39.320
and asked listeners to send us some ways that they've applied what they've learned on

00:39.320 --> 00:45.160
the podcast to their work. We've seen some great responses and for those of you that did

00:45.160 --> 00:51.400
take the time to reach out, thanks so much. An example I've heard several times, including

00:51.400 --> 00:57.040
most recently from Kelvin Ross, who presented at the last meetup, is from folks who learned

00:57.040 --> 01:02.480
about and gone on to implement the Lime Model Explanability Technique, which stands for

01:02.480 --> 01:09.560
Local Interpretable Model Ignostic Explanations, from my interview with Carlos Guestrin.

01:09.560 --> 01:14.400
One of our favorite comments on the anniversary page came from listener Yuri Gorin, who mentioned

01:14.400 --> 01:19.920
that something clicked for him after hearing Jeff Dean discuss embedding categorical features

01:19.920 --> 01:24.880
with Word to Vec. After listening to that podcast, he was able to implement that technique

01:24.880 --> 01:30.460
to represent various features in one of his models as dense vectors. Fast AI's Rachel

01:30.460 --> 01:35.320
Thomas also referenced the interview with Jeff in her recent blog post about that technique,

01:35.320 --> 01:41.640
which we'll link to in the show notes. In keeping with the theme of listener sharing,

01:41.640 --> 01:46.760
for today's show, I'm super excited to share this interview with Nick Osborne, a long

01:46.760 --> 01:51.560
time listener of the show, and leader of the global machine learning project management

01:51.560 --> 01:58.640
office at AES Corporation, a Fortune 200 power company. Nick and I met at my AI summit

01:58.640 --> 02:03.720
a few weeks back, and after a brief chat about some of the things he was up to at AES,

02:03.720 --> 02:09.080
I knew that I needed to get him on the show. In this interview, Nick and I explore how

02:09.080 --> 02:14.760
AES is implementing machine learning across multiple domains at the company. We dig into

02:14.760 --> 02:19.840
several examples falling under the natural language, computer vision, and cognitive assets

02:19.840 --> 02:24.800
categories that he's established for his projects. Along the way, we cover some of the key

02:24.800 --> 02:30.160
podcast episodes that help Nick discover potentially applicable ML techniques and how

02:30.160 --> 02:35.720
those are helping his team broaden the use of machine learning at AES. This was a fun

02:35.720 --> 02:42.080
and informative conversation that has a lot to offer. Thanks so much, Nick. Alright, let's

02:42.080 --> 02:43.560
do it.

02:43.560 --> 02:52.000
Alright, everyone, I am on the line with Nick Osborne. Nick is the leader of the global

02:52.000 --> 02:57.960
machine learning project management office with AES. Nick, welcome to this week in machine

02:57.960 --> 03:02.000
learning and AI. Thanks for having me. I'm really excited.

03:02.000 --> 03:07.280
Same here. So you are a long time listener of the podcast, who I finally had an opportunity

03:07.280 --> 03:12.680
to meet at my AI some of the few weeks ago, and we got into a really interesting discussion

03:12.680 --> 03:17.600
about some of the things that you're working on at AES. So I'm really looking forward to

03:17.600 --> 03:22.240
digging into that, but before we do, why don't you give us an overview of how you got

03:22.240 --> 03:25.640
started working in machine learning and AI?

03:25.640 --> 03:33.240
Sure. So my start in machine learning and AI is maybe a little bit different from the

03:33.240 --> 03:40.160
typical interview you have on in that I've come from the business analyst side. So my

03:40.160 --> 03:46.400
background is very much finance and consulting. I worked actually in restructuring, which

03:46.400 --> 03:52.400
is working with distressed businesses. But in that work, one of the things that we always

03:52.400 --> 03:59.520
end up doing is a lot of analysis, a lot of work with big data sets. And so when I think

03:59.520 --> 04:05.600
about my background and data science broadly, I think of it from that perspective and really

04:05.600 --> 04:13.400
understanding the value that this type of analysis can add to a business, the real value

04:13.400 --> 04:18.920
it can add for an organization long term and the real financial and practical business

04:18.920 --> 04:26.920
applications. So from that background and really over the last five years now, I've been

04:26.920 --> 04:35.600
working closely with the CTO of our organization to do various strategy initiatives. And one

04:35.600 --> 04:41.680
of those about two years ago, actually a little more than two years ago now, we got started

04:41.680 --> 04:51.480
in looking at machine learning, AI and advanced analytics. And really that effort has continued

04:51.480 --> 04:56.680
to where we are now. And so it's gone from just trying to understand the space to doing

04:56.680 --> 05:04.760
a series of pilots. We've had some some initial successes with our pilot efforts and practical

05:04.760 --> 05:12.360
applications to now where we're really starting to dig in on the companies, making a more

05:12.360 --> 05:17.960
cognizant and more focused investment in upgrading our digital capabilities.

05:17.960 --> 05:24.320
Fantastic. So I think it will help contextualize the discussion of the things that you're

05:24.320 --> 05:31.560
working on for folks to better understand AES and what the company's focus is.

05:31.560 --> 05:40.480
Sure. So AES is a global power company. That's power generation. So we own power plants

05:40.480 --> 05:46.360
and utilities in 15 countries around the world. That's down. Our footprints shrunk a little

05:46.360 --> 05:52.560
bit over the last several years, but we're now currently operating in 15 countries. We

05:52.560 --> 06:04.760
own generation assets that span the spectrum of from solar wind to natural gas and coal.

06:04.760 --> 06:09.320
We are making a very cognizant effort in the in the business to invest in in greener

06:09.320 --> 06:15.800
technologies and transitioning more of our fleet away from coal to cleaner and and a

06:15.800 --> 06:21.760
big focus on renewable renewable energy. And I think one other thing to add in there is

06:21.760 --> 06:25.520
that we are the world's leader in battery energy storage.

06:25.520 --> 06:32.160
What aspect of battery energy storage? So we focus on primarily utility scale, battery

06:32.160 --> 06:39.520
energy storage. So these are the grid facilities that go in. They're usually tensed to hundreds

06:39.520 --> 06:48.680
of megawatts in scale. And they provide a spectrum of services for the grid from balancing

06:48.680 --> 06:55.000
to frequency regulation. And really what we're starting to see now is that these energy storage

06:55.000 --> 07:03.520
assets can actually replace or take the place of a thermal or a natural gas peaking plant.

07:03.520 --> 07:11.760
So it's really one of the ways we are starting to shift the energy networks away from thermal

07:11.760 --> 07:15.000
to cleaner and more renewable technologies.

07:15.000 --> 07:22.280
When you first started to think about applying machine learning and AI to AES's business,

07:22.280 --> 07:27.480
how did you how did you think about it? Where did you think the opportunities were and

07:27.480 --> 07:29.960
what was the initial driver?

07:29.960 --> 07:37.480
Yeah, so you know I think the at the very beginning you know it was much more of a research

07:37.480 --> 07:44.880
effort. And then we kind of slowly began to add additional things that we saw that could

07:44.880 --> 07:50.960
be applicable across the enterprise. And I think where we've gotten to and where we're

07:50.960 --> 07:57.880
current thinking is is that AI can play a role really across the full spectrum of the

07:57.880 --> 08:05.560
enterprise. So currently we have projects going on in language, we have projects going

08:05.560 --> 08:12.400
on in vision, and then we have projects going on in a theme that we call cognitive assets,

08:12.400 --> 08:18.320
which is where we you know try to bring intelligence to our machines. So our power plants right

08:18.320 --> 08:25.200
and that's where we get into maybe the most the clearest or the first area that maybe

08:25.200 --> 08:30.000
came to mind was how could we make our power plants more efficient? How could we operate

08:30.000 --> 08:35.040
them more effectively over the long term and that's where we get into predictive analytics

08:35.040 --> 08:41.840
type initiatives and projects. But really we're looking across the full breadth of the organization

08:41.840 --> 08:49.680
of from HR to strategy. You know being in generation safety is a you know critical piece of how

08:49.680 --> 08:55.000
we operate. And so we've had a few projects take a look at at safety and how we can improve

08:55.000 --> 09:01.520
safety using AI techniques. Before we go to the your first projects you mentioned that the

09:01.520 --> 09:09.360
initial emphasis was research and really learning how did you go about that that learning phase

09:09.360 --> 09:21.040
of this? Well Sam I would say your podcast was that wasn't a softball. Oh no but seriously this

09:21.040 --> 09:26.880
podcast was was a great way to learn about the industry and you know really going back to your

09:26.880 --> 09:31.680
tagline you know interesting people doing interesting things and machine learning and that's

09:31.680 --> 09:37.200
that's really you know the role played for for me and I know several other people in the company

09:37.200 --> 09:44.080
you know listen to the podcast as well. And it was really a great way to get exposed I mean there's

09:44.080 --> 09:52.320
so much activity in the space right now and the filtering and the interview you do with you

09:52.320 --> 09:58.320
know with kind of key people in each of these businesses. It was a great way for us to get our

09:58.320 --> 10:04.160
our heads around you know the breadth of everything going on and and maybe even give us a little bit

10:04.160 --> 10:10.480
of focus on to on the companies that we're doing you know the actual interesting work or some of

10:10.480 --> 10:18.400
the interesting work. And how about coursework have you had various people in the company taken

10:19.280 --> 10:28.160
or pursued kind of formal coursework in the area or research efforts? So yeah people have been

10:28.160 --> 10:34.880
doing coursework formally and informally. We were lucky to have a few people who actually had

10:35.520 --> 10:42.240
some data science as part of their graduate graduate studies and so that that was very helpful

10:42.960 --> 10:49.200
but people have been working through the you know Andrew Hings Coursera work. I know I've

10:49.200 --> 10:55.520
taken a look at some of the stuff on edX and and whatnot and then we've also been just using

10:55.520 --> 11:04.480
you know using some of the like some of the free tutorials that are available like through Azure

11:04.480 --> 11:09.120
and through some of the other platforms and really trying to focus on getting people's hands dirty

11:09.120 --> 11:14.400
with these tools and that's that's something that we actually have done a number of times now where

11:14.400 --> 11:21.120
we lead what we call cohorts which are about a month long where we focus on getting people hands

11:21.120 --> 11:27.600
on with machine learning tools. So we've used you know things like the Azure platform we've gotten

11:27.600 --> 11:36.400
people into Google and some of their tools and TensorFlow we've done work with a cortical and some

11:36.400 --> 11:43.280
of the free APIs they have and getting people to use them IBM Bluemix we did work with some of

11:43.280 --> 11:49.120
their cognitive tools and just just really trying to get people you know past you know reading about

11:49.120 --> 11:54.160
it and getting people to use some of these tools and see how they work and see how people can

11:54.160 --> 11:59.040
interact with them and that's been something that's been you know very helpful for people in the

11:59.040 --> 12:06.000
company. Awesome awesome so you mentioned cortical and this was a great story that you told me at the

12:06.000 --> 12:12.720
at the air summit and I guess it ties to that language that first of the three main areas that you've

12:12.720 --> 12:22.320
dug into. Yeah can you start by talking a little bit about where you see the use cases for

12:23.920 --> 12:31.600
NLP NLU types of technologies and language and then some of the things that you've done. Sure.

12:32.800 --> 12:38.880
So I think language in particular is one of the ones where we see some broad applications and so

12:38.880 --> 12:45.760
just initially we've done some some piloting and some testing and language is actually one of

12:45.760 --> 12:52.640
the areas where we've done some work around safety and seeing if we can you know improve safety or

12:52.640 --> 12:59.360
find some predictive capabilities through language and so so that's one area and I can go into more

12:59.360 --> 13:04.320
depth if you want on that but you know we're also looking at strategy I think there's a number of

13:04.320 --> 13:11.760
possibilities within HR. I think there's a tremendous opportunity for AI and machine learning to

13:11.760 --> 13:18.480
help with the recruiting and the evaluation of candidates through their the resume submissions

13:19.200 --> 13:25.840
and then a lot of my current thinking is around the strategy effort and how can we you know

13:25.840 --> 13:31.840
understand the the exponential content that is going out there or that is coming in and really

13:31.840 --> 13:39.280
provide a you know I'm meaningful way to to understand that content and to get it in front of

13:39.280 --> 13:46.400
our decision-makers in a timely and relevant fashion. So maybe start with safety and take us a

13:46.400 --> 13:51.600
little deeper into what you're what you've done and what you're hoping to achieve there.

13:52.560 --> 13:58.480
Yeah so so safety actually ended up not being one of our more successful projects okay

13:58.480 --> 14:05.280
but you know what the way we work is are one of the things that we do throughout our company is

14:05.280 --> 14:12.960
our things called safety rocks and we also do a lot of just safety monitoring where people go out

14:12.960 --> 14:18.480
and they they will document any safety findings throughout the company and so one of the things

14:18.480 --> 14:23.920
that we are hoping to do is could we could we look at that data set it's a written data set to

14:23.920 --> 14:31.440
understand if there were any triggers or our identifiers in those data sets that could lead us to

14:31.440 --> 14:37.520
understanding you know either really really good safety environments or versus poor safety

14:37.520 --> 14:43.440
environments and what would be an example of a trigger or identifier that you might expect to

14:44.720 --> 14:50.800
correlate to safety. Yeah and and maybe some of that's why that project wasn't as successful as

14:50.800 --> 14:59.040
you know trying to understand the way people are talking about safety and the words that

14:59.040 --> 15:04.320
they're using are writing about the safety of their of their facilities or plants right so

15:04.320 --> 15:10.960
it was a bit nebulous and we didn't get super far on on that project before it was kind of deemed

15:10.960 --> 15:17.920
not not super feasible however so maybe switching over to areas where we did make a little more

15:17.920 --> 15:25.520
progress was we did and this was one of the projects we did with with cortical are using some

15:25.520 --> 15:31.760
of the tools from cortical but we also do periodic culture surveys throughout the organization

15:32.400 --> 15:40.960
and so you know we're a global company with a lot of people so we received 13,000 surveys

15:40.960 --> 15:48.880
back in our last cultural survey effort most of that is multiple choice but we also had four

15:48.880 --> 15:55.600
open entry text fields that people could respond to four questions we were opposing so which ended

15:55.600 --> 16:03.040
up what that's receiving about 30,000 written written responses right so that's a lot of

16:04.080 --> 16:09.600
just data for anyone to kind of sort through or mine through it's very hard to be consistent in

16:09.600 --> 16:17.440
that evaluation even with even if one person read it all and so what we you know we use the tool

16:17.440 --> 16:24.320
from cortical and what we did a number of different analyses but you know what we were looking to do

16:24.320 --> 16:31.840
is benchmark those statements against 60 other statements that we had and so one of the things that

16:31.840 --> 16:38.800
cortical allows you to do is compared two different text you know text documents or text fields

16:38.800 --> 16:43.520
paragraphs or whatever and compare them on a semantic level right so this is where you get your

16:43.520 --> 16:49.840
your overlap between the two and basically by understanding the overlap we were able to benchmark

16:49.840 --> 16:57.760
the responses that we were getting against a series of 60 criteria which are helping us to evaluate

16:57.760 --> 17:02.880
the culture in each of our facilities and so since each of those responses came back with

17:02.880 --> 17:10.480
with the demographic information not anything identifiable to an individual but with kind of broad

17:10.480 --> 17:16.800
demographics male female kind of rough age ranges and those sort of things we were able to kind

17:16.800 --> 17:22.640
of peel the onion a little bit deeper and try to identify on a comparative basis you know which

17:22.640 --> 17:28.240
locations are you know caring about different parts of our culture right so just an example here is

17:28.240 --> 17:33.760
you know one facility could really care about advancement opportunities other facilities could

17:33.760 --> 17:41.360
care about benefits and this was a way for us to really mine that 30,000 comments or questions

17:41.360 --> 17:48.640
that we received back to to really understand the business on a deeper level and so

17:49.440 --> 17:54.000
so that was one part of the analysis we also pulled in some additional tools we pulled in

17:54.000 --> 18:00.640
and before you before you get too far from this particular piece part of what was exciting

18:01.280 --> 18:10.640
for media here from you was that you initially came across the work that cortical was doing

18:10.640 --> 18:16.560
around their semantic folding and semantic NLP stuff yeah through the podcast actually

18:16.560 --> 18:24.000
twin will talk number 10 with their founder Francisco Weber is that right yeah so that is where we

18:24.000 --> 18:31.280
first we first learned about it and I want to say you also had a talk with Numenta on later which

18:31.280 --> 18:38.160
is kind of the founding company are the research institute but yeah so twin will talk 10 with

18:38.160 --> 18:44.880
Francisco Weber was I found it to be incredibly fascinating one of the other you know people in

18:44.880 --> 18:50.480
our company also listen to that podcast and also found it really interesting and we kind of kept

18:50.480 --> 18:54.880
bringing it up to the CTO of our organization on like this is this is different the way they are

18:54.880 --> 19:00.560
thinking about language is just fundamentally different than a lot of the other language tools

19:00.560 --> 19:06.160
that we had seen and at the time we had also spent a fair amount of effort looking into like the IBM

19:06.160 --> 19:13.040
tools and just saw this as something really different and something that to me just kind of

19:13.040 --> 19:19.840
fundamentally makes more sense in the understanding of language so I found it to be really interesting

19:19.840 --> 19:26.080
and for this particular project it sounds like you had good result in understanding

19:26.880 --> 19:34.320
these survey responses did you come up with a measure of you know the results or how good

19:34.320 --> 19:41.280
the results were and had you tried other approaches previously that you know we're we're

19:41.280 --> 19:50.640
that you also measured and like could compare the success so no so we didn't do a comparative analysis

19:50.640 --> 19:57.200
against a different tool but the speed we were able to work through on the tool was much faster

19:57.200 --> 20:06.400
than what we were seeing with other tools and our ability to use it and we were and we were

20:06.400 --> 20:11.680
primarily using just the free API and doing some coding on our side to to make it all work and

20:12.480 --> 20:18.800
manipulate the data into it but it worked great and the and you know we didn't

20:19.520 --> 20:26.640
there wasn't an easy like precision or yeah precision type measure that we could get but we

20:26.640 --> 20:31.360
we spent a fair amount of time validating it just one on one on one going through the responses

20:31.360 --> 20:36.800
and seeing seeing the comparison that it was providing or the prediction that it was providing

20:36.800 --> 20:41.200
through the tool and making sure that it it lined up with what we were seeing so we did a

20:41.920 --> 20:46.880
you know we did some a fair amount of data testing or testing you know once we had

20:46.880 --> 20:51.840
worked through the tool but we didn't have a defined prediction measure for it.

20:51.840 --> 20:57.920
Awesome and I cut you off you were talking you were about to mention other tools I think you were

20:57.920 --> 21:04.640
saying that you were looking at. Yeah so we used some other tools to bring in sentiment analysis

21:04.640 --> 21:09.360
into it right so running the same question through a tool to get sentiment so positive negative

21:09.360 --> 21:14.640
sentiment and the emotional state that was coming back so that was you know again that's just

21:14.640 --> 21:19.680
providing another layer of information on it so we could you know understand whether or not people

21:19.680 --> 21:24.480
were talking positively or negatively about management versus just saying oh that person's

21:24.480 --> 21:30.880
you know talking about management. Okay and so that was that was a you know a helpful layer to add

21:30.880 --> 21:38.320
in there and then the second big piece of the analysis was trying to pull out what we were calling

21:38.320 --> 21:44.880
the meta nouns and meta adjectives from the sentences which were you know the primary topics

21:45.600 --> 21:52.160
and the primary descriptors of the topics that were being used in those statements and so

21:52.160 --> 21:59.120
if you think about the different ways a person could talk about you know their boss right it could

21:59.120 --> 22:05.840
be their leader it could be management manager it could be you know a lot of different descriptors

22:06.560 --> 22:12.240
and so we were able to pull out what we were returning meta nouns and meta adjectives and combine

22:12.240 --> 22:18.720
them together to what we were what we were terming at the time caveman speak which was you know

22:18.720 --> 22:24.160
stuff like you know management good development bad right or something along those lines right so

22:24.160 --> 22:30.880
really basic understanding of the thematic content of the of their responses and again that

22:30.880 --> 22:35.200
that helped us really narrow down what was what was being said because then we could look at

22:35.840 --> 22:41.120
across the organization or across the sample that we are working with on you know what were the

22:41.120 --> 22:46.720
the key things that people were saying right so trying to replicate how a human would go through

22:46.720 --> 22:52.960
that data set and you know pull out the the major themes and you know and this is exactly what

22:52.960 --> 22:56.720
we saw when we talked to the actual humans were who were going through it as they were going through

22:56.720 --> 23:04.160
and they were you know basically tick marking every time that they came across you know a response

23:04.160 --> 23:10.160
with a particular topic in it and so we we tried to use the the cortical tool to basically do

23:10.160 --> 23:17.120
the same thing for us is provide us an understanding of the topics that were coming back in the in

23:17.120 --> 23:22.800
the responses okay interesting interesting yeah and so you you've mentioned safety you've mentioned

23:22.800 --> 23:29.440
this I kind of assuming that is a HR use case and you mentioned strategy as well which it sounds

23:29.440 --> 23:36.640
like that is related to kind of content management is not the right word but kind of content understanding

23:36.640 --> 23:42.800
I guess talk a little bit about that strategy use case and what you did there yeah so this is one

23:42.800 --> 23:48.640
of the ones where we're still working and we had a fair amount of success at the end of last year

23:48.640 --> 23:55.840
and we're kind of reevaluating next steps on this project but basically what we were able to do

23:55.840 --> 24:02.640
is we were able to we we built a scraper to go scrape and we limited you know where we were scraping

24:02.640 --> 24:08.720
the information from for this pilot but we were able to pull out new new news articles from a

24:08.720 --> 24:14.640
from a data source we're then able to evaluate those news articles against and we're going down to

24:14.640 --> 24:21.840
the I think the paragraph level but we were pulling out the are comparing those new at our articles

24:21.840 --> 24:28.240
against specific strategic scenarios that we were for seeing in the next three to five years

24:28.240 --> 24:34.880
for that space and so you know we had gone through an an effort of you know putting the other

24:34.880 --> 24:41.040
and like a red scenario green scenario blue scenario that we were comparing these news articles

24:41.040 --> 24:46.240
against right so we were able to say you know does this you know news article lineup with

24:47.200 --> 24:52.240
you know our green scenario which maybe our green scenario is you know full transition to

24:52.240 --> 24:58.560
clean energy right and these are just very theoretical examples but and so we were able to kind

24:58.560 --> 25:04.560
of understand you know what the news article was about put a categorize it against us like a

25:04.560 --> 25:10.960
strategic outcome that we saw you know in the next three to five years and then what we also did

25:10.960 --> 25:18.480
is we built we built in the ability to present this to a user so we built a little slack interface

25:18.480 --> 25:25.600
to present the news article and the prediction to a user and whether or not to find out whether

25:25.600 --> 25:31.520
or not they agreed or disagreed with our prediction and then we use that prediction to further

25:31.520 --> 25:39.520
hone our our initial and our initial you know pick our prediction okay we're using any particular

25:39.520 --> 25:47.920
tools as part of that or did you develop the tooling for that internally yeah we're working with

25:47.920 --> 25:54.240
corticals API okay again for that one okay but we built a lot of the a lot of the other tooling

25:54.240 --> 26:02.240
was done in-house I think we were using scraping to do the actual web you know crawl and scrape

26:02.240 --> 26:08.240
function but yeah which I've heard great things about yeah it worked really well it was very

26:08.240 --> 26:15.040
quick for us to get up and running I didn't do the actual work with it but it was fast and easy

26:15.040 --> 26:22.640
so that's a good thing okay cool so that's some of the things that you've done on the language

26:22.640 --> 26:28.080
side of things how about vision yeah so visions really interesting and that's one of the areas

26:28.080 --> 26:37.520
we're currently pretty active on so and actually so maybe one one thing Sam we did really early on

26:37.520 --> 26:43.360
and this was just another example of where your podcast came in but you did an interview with

26:43.360 --> 26:53.280
Clarify with Matt Ziller and so we were able to just using again the free the free tooling from

26:53.280 --> 26:59.120
Clarify we were able to prove out a use case and safety where we could detect hard hats right so

26:59.120 --> 27:04.880
we could detect whether or not people were wearing their their PPE their protective equipment

27:05.920 --> 27:11.360
and I mean it was it's like built in the tool just does it for you automatically and so we

27:11.360 --> 27:16.480
we were able to prove out really quickly that yeah this is something that we could do is you know

27:16.480 --> 27:20.480
basically set up a camera to detect whether or not people are wearing their hard hats or

27:21.280 --> 27:27.760
their work gloves or work boots right but yeah I mean it was again it was a really easy tool just

27:27.760 --> 27:34.240
to get up and running we didn't we haven't like pursued that use case but yeah I mean really

27:34.240 --> 27:39.040
and just another example of kind of one of the ways you know we listen to the podcast learned

27:39.040 --> 27:44.720
about a company and then try to you know check it out and bring it into a business application

27:44.720 --> 27:52.640
awesome awesome and so what else have you done on the vision front so yeah so right now we are

27:52.640 --> 28:01.840
working heavily on a project where we are trying to detect damage and drone drone inspection

28:01.840 --> 28:08.160
footage and so we have we have some good data sets that we're working on and we're currently

28:08.160 --> 28:15.440
primarily working with with Google on this effort but we're looking at some other applications are

28:15.440 --> 28:21.280
you know potential applications but Google has been really helpful and working with us we're hoping

28:21.280 --> 28:26.720
to do a few more projects in the coming weeks but you know where this project started off is we

28:26.720 --> 28:34.240
started off with with TensorFlow and with the inception model there and that's specifically for

28:34.240 --> 28:41.600
our use case which was this damage detection project we were able to you you know prove out

28:41.600 --> 28:48.880
that it worked our initial couple models we're working but we were getting problems with

28:50.000 --> 28:55.520
high false positive rates so that's really where we've we've focused in now we're spending a

28:55.520 --> 29:01.920
lot of time working on our labeling and so the labeling has been a big part of the data cleanup

29:01.920 --> 29:06.800
and I'm sure it's not a surprise for anyone who's worked on data science that getting your data

29:06.800 --> 29:13.600
set correct is incredibly important especially when the data set wasn't necessarily built for

29:14.480 --> 29:20.800
for data science right it was the data set we were starting from was just it was built for for

29:20.800 --> 29:25.440
humans and for human inspectors to understand what was going on with the pictures

29:25.440 --> 29:34.480
and so it was it was I mean it's messy and inconsistent what's an example of the kind of damage

29:34.480 --> 29:39.600
that you were looking to determine and what specifically did that data set look like

29:40.400 --> 29:48.400
sure so so our data set right now is you know we own win facilities across the United States

29:48.400 --> 29:57.760
we have three primary projects and about 500 turbines in the US and so the data set we are

29:57.760 --> 30:05.600
looking at is the inspection footage of those of those blades and just for just for sizing each

30:05.600 --> 30:13.280
of the three facilities when we do an inspection we'll come back between 10 and 20,000 images

30:13.280 --> 30:20.560
of those inspections and the supremacally blade inspections right and so the these are images

30:20.560 --> 30:28.000
taken via drone of the blades while they're stopped you know they take pictures of all aspects

30:28.000 --> 30:33.120
so the four kind of different directions of the blade so you know the high pressure side

30:33.120 --> 30:40.560
low pressure side leading and trailing edges the damage can be surprising you know for you know

30:40.560 --> 30:48.080
for for a for a turbine blade that I mean is kind of just going through air there's there's a lot

30:48.080 --> 30:56.400
of different damage types that we see this can you know be like erosion and so some of our facilities

30:56.400 --> 31:02.080
are in our very area or desert landscapes and there's a fair amount of dust in particular matter

31:02.080 --> 31:09.120
so you can get erosion you can get bird strikes so birds hitting the turbine blades which can

31:09.120 --> 31:15.920
do a fair amount of damage lightning lightning strikes and so you I mean you will see you will

31:15.920 --> 31:22.720
see things from you know small you know divots and dense and coating penetrations to kind of

31:22.720 --> 31:31.200
large scale delamination of sections of the blade and so yeah I mean that's that's the that's the

31:31.200 --> 31:39.280
data set and then you know traditionally so I mean if we go backwards a little bit Sam so before

31:39.280 --> 31:44.320
drones these were all these inspections were done manually so someone would climb up the tower

31:44.320 --> 31:50.640
and go down and you know look for damage that way so dangerous time consuming work

31:51.840 --> 31:56.480
when we switched over to drones that was a tremendous tremendous time saver

31:56.480 --> 32:04.480
but had the had the side effect on while now now someone has to review you know 10 to 20

32:04.480 --> 32:12.880
thousand images right and the drones are capturing still images or video so in this application it's

32:12.880 --> 32:19.840
still but you know we we actually have a drone partner that we work with measure and so they can

32:19.840 --> 32:26.480
do different you know image types they can do video or my understanding is they can do video and

32:26.480 --> 32:33.200
infrared and so infrared you know is infrared's actually really important for solar applications

32:33.200 --> 32:40.560
and it's the infrared's a really great way to spot problems on a solar field and I'm assuming

32:40.560 --> 32:47.200
that they're the drones are manually operated as opposed to you know autonomously kind of going

32:47.200 --> 32:54.000
through a field of of turbines yeah correct yeah this is all they're all manually flown

32:54.000 --> 32:59.040
they fly a defined flight pattern when they when they do the inspections but yes it's all manual

32:59.840 --> 33:07.440
and so the you you started with TensorFlow and there's been some that the main issue you're

33:07.440 --> 33:17.120
focusing on now is addressing some issues with your labeling how was the labeling done previously

33:17.120 --> 33:26.800
are these the either your engineers or the drone providers kind of manually writing up a report of

33:26.800 --> 33:34.480
some sort are they coded or something what were you starting yeah so it's changed and it's changing

33:34.480 --> 33:42.320
so it it started off I mean really pretty rudimentary on just people entering information and an

33:42.320 --> 33:49.200
Excel worksheet as they were going through the images our drone partner that we work with now

33:49.200 --> 33:56.880
has some tools to allow them to be kind of more to be you know bounding boxes and to be systematically

33:56.880 --> 34:03.360
labeled with very defined categories and so that's that's helping us really get get where we need to

34:03.360 --> 34:07.920
get to go on the on the labeling side or we hope we'll get us where we need to go on the labeling

34:07.920 --> 34:16.640
side so yeah we're working on getting consistent labels getting those damage instances bounded

34:17.120 --> 34:25.280
to help which we think will be helpful and I'm curious have you explored any of this use case or

34:25.280 --> 34:34.800
any of the others active learning specifically meaning so you train a model based on some set of

34:34.800 --> 34:43.600
data and then you have incremental you basically have a human kind of correct the models decision

34:44.240 --> 34:50.000
on an incremental basis and feed that back in to the model training have you done anything at all

34:50.000 --> 34:57.040
with that actually who we just we just kind of looked at that maybe starting last week okay so

34:58.160 --> 35:05.360
so we've kind of switched over to using auto m auto ml from with google okay and so that has some

35:05.360 --> 35:10.480
of that functionality built right in and so that's that's that's how we're proceeding on that path

35:10.480 --> 35:15.840
is we I won't say we're we've done much with it yet but that's that's part of the plan at this

35:15.840 --> 35:22.640
point once we kind of got our heads around that like we were really excited yeah yeah yeah I mean

35:22.640 --> 35:28.000
it's potentially interesting and I'm hearing some some interesting stories of folks starting to

35:28.000 --> 35:34.480
see good results with it all right cool are there any other any other vision use cases that you've

35:34.480 --> 35:40.800
looked at not not that we're actively working on but I think the applications for drawing

35:40.800 --> 35:45.040
inspection footage is something that we're kind of looking at broadly yeah and there's there's a

35:45.040 --> 35:49.920
lot of different use use cases within the the power space and utility space in general so I

35:49.920 --> 35:57.600
could imagine yeah so it's it's dangerous work it's high voltages high pressures so any anytime we

35:57.600 --> 36:05.440
can take a human like a remote or take them out of that situation is generally seen as a positive

36:05.440 --> 36:12.480
thing and drones are a big part of that and then the flip side of that is taking advantage of the

36:12.480 --> 36:20.480
onboard sensor data to predict machine failure and that kind of leads us to that third category

36:20.480 --> 36:25.680
of cognitive assets can you talk a little bit about what you're doing there yeah so cognitive

36:25.680 --> 36:31.680
assets is a bit of a broad category for us where we we look at a number of or we look at a

36:31.680 --> 36:37.760
number of prediction type capabilities there and really looking at that you know anomaly detection

36:37.760 --> 36:42.720
in a in a facility predictive maintenance and those sort of things but we've also been able to

36:42.720 --> 36:50.160
do some tuning of our assets and that's really where we've seen the most progress and so this is

36:50.160 --> 36:56.080
one of the ones I think I mentioned to you at the at the interop conference but you know I'm sure

36:56.080 --> 37:03.200
you're familiar with the Google data center use case whether they were able to I believe improve

37:03.200 --> 37:10.960
PUE by 40 percent that's right and PUE is the power or something efficiency correct yeah so

37:12.160 --> 37:17.760
you know it's it's not the exact same application but when you think about our battery energy

37:17.760 --> 37:24.560
storage facilities they are very similar to a data center just without the the compute right they're

37:24.560 --> 37:34.480
just big the racks and racks of batteries and so we we were able to you know use a

37:34.480 --> 37:39.920
developer model that first predicted our power usage and power efficiency and then we were

37:39.920 --> 37:46.080
able to use that model to then improve power efficiency and I believe where last update I had

37:46.080 --> 37:52.400
is we were able to show a 20 percent improvement in in efficiency you know with with an algorithm

37:52.400 --> 37:57.920
that we built largely trying to you know copy Google's work in the area and so

37:59.280 --> 38:04.960
that's something that has now moved on into our energy storage business and our energy

38:04.960 --> 38:10.800
storage business got spun out over this past past year into a new enterprise called

38:10.800 --> 38:15.680
Fluence with partnering with Siemens and so it's on joint joint bench and they've they've taken

38:15.680 --> 38:22.240
that project and they continue to to run with it and run with deeper applications of machine learning

38:22.960 --> 38:28.400
on on their what they call their advanced on software interesting so the can you talk a little bit

38:28.400 --> 38:37.040
about the how that project evolved and the data assessment and collection phase the modeling phase

38:37.040 --> 38:43.840
how did you dig into it and how did you get started with it really so yeah I mean it started off

38:43.840 --> 38:49.040
just you know getting access to the data and so one of the great things about our energy storage

38:49.040 --> 38:55.360
facilities is that they're they're digitally native and so all the control systems have been

38:55.360 --> 39:03.760
digital since the very beginning and so we have literally you know tens of terabytes of of information

39:03.760 --> 39:11.520
just from our energy storage assets and so that's a tremendous data set for people to start working

39:11.520 --> 39:18.880
with one of the things that we were or one of the initial kind of difficulties we came across as

39:18.880 --> 39:29.120
that we had always had like a single set point on our on our basically our HVAC system right so

39:29.120 --> 39:37.360
we didn't have a very we didn't have a very diverse data set on on how to manipulate our HVAC

39:37.360 --> 39:44.000
system right so it always had a fixed set point and so one of the things that we had done is we

39:44.000 --> 39:51.200
we did modify our control software to allow to allow some variability in that HVAC setting and so

39:51.200 --> 39:56.320
that that was kind of one of the initial things that we had to work through on on getting a

39:57.040 --> 40:03.200
more meaningful data set for a modeling effort and really once we got beyond there it kind of

40:03.200 --> 40:08.960
all kind of clicked into space and to place on improving our predictive capability on our model

40:08.960 --> 40:14.080
and then and then being able to use that model to tune the system so was the HVAC

40:14.880 --> 40:21.200
system the primary system that you were controlling to increase power efficiency or was it

40:21.200 --> 40:26.400
something related to the batteries themselves or something else yeah no it was primarily the HVAC

40:26.400 --> 40:32.320
system so we were we were really focused on what we call in the in the power industry our auxiliary

40:32.320 --> 40:39.280
load which is the you know it's basically the power we use to well yeah to make power right

40:39.280 --> 40:44.960
and that's kind of the so yeah that's that's what we were really focusing on and you know any time

40:44.960 --> 40:50.880
we can reduce that ox load means we can put more of that power into the into the marketplace

40:51.440 --> 40:57.440
and it's really an efficiency thing for for power plants and do you have a sense for off the

40:57.440 --> 41:03.600
top of your head what that 20% improvement translates into from a business perspective in terms of

41:03.600 --> 41:11.920
you know dollars per year or x per x yeah I I don't have a good I don't have a good figure for that

41:11.920 --> 41:19.040
but it's got to be it's meaningful yeah I mean that's it's meaningful I don't know what the

41:19.040 --> 41:26.080
dollar impact is though maybe taking a step back from these three use case categories

41:26.080 --> 41:36.480
mm-hmm I'm curious if you can speak to running a ML PMO in an organization that you know has

41:36.480 --> 41:40.560
another business your business isn't you know you're not a software company machine learning

41:40.560 --> 41:46.720
company anything like that like how do you approach portfolio management of all these

41:46.720 --> 41:54.800
individual efforts and and you know how do you see that evolving as you gain maturity sure so

41:54.800 --> 42:01.040
you know really on you know we when I worked with our our CTO and defining the you know the

42:01.040 --> 42:08.160
what the PMO would do and what my role would be the role and was really to be to you know facilitate

42:08.880 --> 42:14.960
coordinate and accelerate these projects and so you know being such a distributed business

42:14.960 --> 42:19.440
it was really important that we helped help the businesses foster their own projects and help

42:19.440 --> 42:26.640
them find resources they need and open their eyes to some of the capabilities but to allow for

42:26.640 --> 42:34.960
some organic growth and or organic direction from from the businesses so that was one area where

42:34.960 --> 42:41.840
we've really tried to I don't want to say be hands off but instead of directing each of our

42:41.840 --> 42:47.680
businesses to do something with with ML we've tried to kind of open their eyes to the technology

42:47.680 --> 42:53.360
and to be available to them to help foster or to help facilitate any of these projects coming forward

42:54.400 --> 42:59.360
that said we've also done kind of taking the lead on several projects right so we couldn't let

42:59.360 --> 43:05.680
everything just be you know wait for wait to come to us so we we kind of took a dual approach where

43:05.680 --> 43:14.720
we've led some projects but then we've also put a fairly cognizant effort into raising awareness

43:14.720 --> 43:23.760
of of ML technologies and tools and the business applications and the potential to our senior leaders

43:23.760 --> 43:30.960
and to really some some broad user groups across the company so trying to trying to raise awareness

43:31.920 --> 43:40.400
while also trying to show some successes with our with our pilots and do you have any advice or

43:40.400 --> 43:46.160
kind of lessons learned you know from that perspective the portfolio perspective or the like

43:46.160 --> 43:54.640
introducing ML and AI to a large organization perspective that you would share with folks that

43:54.640 --> 44:00.960
are maybe similarly situated but earlier on in the process. Sure well I think the the biggest

44:00.960 --> 44:08.560
thing is to talk about it and to you know communicate I'm I think just in general that's that's

44:08.560 --> 44:14.720
the biggest thing I find between you know successful efforts and non successful efforts this goes

44:14.720 --> 44:22.240
well before my time at AAS is the clarity of that communication across the organization is key

44:23.200 --> 44:29.520
we've really tried to get our senior leaders on board and I've seen some really great commitment by

44:29.520 --> 44:37.120
our our COO in particular and even our CEO and talking about the capabilities and the need for

44:37.120 --> 44:45.840
our business to be to move kind of higher up the digital mastery you know curve and with with

44:45.840 --> 44:51.920
machine learning and AI being central to that and so getting that executive buy-in is always critical

44:52.560 --> 44:58.000
but then really starting to talk you know down down in the business where where stuff tends to happen

44:58.000 --> 45:04.000
right so the executive support is really important but there's people who are you know working in

45:04.000 --> 45:10.480
this data on a day-to-day basis who have some incredible you know sector matter expertise and

45:10.480 --> 45:16.880
some incredible fundamental knowledge of how the data works and getting those people engaged has

45:16.880 --> 45:22.720
been really important as well because I mean those are those are the people that usually end up

45:22.720 --> 45:29.440
doing the work and and getting them excited about it has been a great avenue for us. That's fantastic

45:29.440 --> 45:35.600
well congratulations on the success you've seen with these projects it sounds like you're doing

45:35.600 --> 45:41.680
really incredible work is there anything else that you'd want to leave folks with?

45:41.680 --> 45:50.960
maybe just you know I'm really committed to the value of of digital and the incredible power that

45:50.960 --> 45:56.480
you know analytics can add to a business you know I've seen firsthand the value it can drive

45:56.480 --> 46:03.440
you know in a variety industries and businesses and you know I just rude highly recommend to

46:03.440 --> 46:08.960
you know to business to business people out there that you know they spend the time to to

46:08.960 --> 46:14.720
understand the technology to demystify it because I think that's something that you know a lot of

46:14.720 --> 46:20.080
people you know if they're just reading kind of the news headlines are are kind of focused on

46:20.080 --> 46:25.920
the kind of the mystical aspect but at the end of the day this is just another or these are just

46:25.920 --> 46:31.840
more tools that you can have in your in your tool belt and you know really drive a lot of value

46:31.840 --> 46:38.160
