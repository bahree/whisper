00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:31,860
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:38,020
This week we present a series of shows recorded at the Pego World Conference in Las Vegas.

5
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,660
The theme of the conference was automation, particularly in service of creating enhanced

6
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,420
customer experiences.

7
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:51,160
In this episode I'm joined by Jim Salah, Senior Director of Process and Decision Automation

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,000
at Scotiabank.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,960
Jim is tasked with helping the bank transition from a world where customer interactions are

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,200
based on historical analysis to one where they're based on real-time decisioning and automation.

11
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,400
In our conversation we discuss what's required to deliver real-time decisioning starting from

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,400
the ground up with the data platform.

13
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,840
In this vein we explore topics like data lakes, data warehouses, integration and more,

14
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,120
and the effort required to take advantage of these.

15
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,360
Before we jump into the interview, I'd like to send a huge thanks to our friends at Pego

16
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,080
Systems for hosting me at Pego World and sponsoring this series.

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,960
One of the great announcements coming out of the conference was Pego Systems' new

18
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,400
self-optimizing AI-powered marketing capabilities.

19
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,460
This is a really interesting offering designed to reduce marketers dependence on traditional

20
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:50,840
segment-based campaigns and transition them towards real-time one-to-one customer engagement.

21
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,560
These new capabilities will be available as part of their new Pego Infinity platform,

22
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,320
which was also announced at the event.

23
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,320
For more info on Pego Infinity, head to Pego.com-slash-infinity.

24
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,520
Alright, let's do it.

25
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:15,640
Alright everyone, I am here at Pego World in Las Vegas and I have the pleasure of being

26
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,880
seated with Jim Salah. Jim is the Senior Director of Process and Decision Automation at Scotiabank.

27
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,720
Jim, welcome to this week in Machine Learning and AI.

28
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,720
Thank you very much.

29
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,720
Happy to be here.

30
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,720
Fantastic.

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,560
Why don't we get started by having you tell us a little bit about your background?

32
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,920
I understand you've got a long history in this space of decision automation.

33
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,160
Sure, decision-impressed automation.

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,160
Sure.

35
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:46,880
So I'm 30 years in IT, 31 years in IT, and I've been implementing a large-scale automation

36
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,160
systems pretty much that whole time.

37
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,760
So I've kind of watched the industry grow and change for many years.

38
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,600
Part of my background actually does involve some fairly heavy data modeling in the financial

39
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,080
services industry and balance sheet analytics and things like that, so mathematical models

40
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,240
and the whole world of AI has kind of just grown up around me.

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,520
And I've seen quite a bit of the change.

42
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:18,960
I've spent probably the last three years or so focused a little bit more on actual real

43
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,360
time decisioning, as part of my practice of process and decision automation.

44
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:30,360
And the reason these two are together is that the bank is very focused not just on better

45
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,040
analytics and better decisions, but on actionable decisions and actually being able to do something

46
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,520
with those.

47
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:43,880
So we've really kind of strategically brought those things together with the intent of making

48
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,720
better decisions and offering better advice and being able to actually follow through with

49
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,720
the customer.

50
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
Okay, awesome.

51
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,800
And so for folks that aren't familiar with Scotiabank, tell us about it's a bank, but tell

52
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:01,320
us about Scotiabank and maybe a little bit of Scotiabank journey with process and decision

53
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
automation.

54
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
Sure.

55
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
Okay.

56
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:11,280
As a Canadian bank, we're based in Toronto, we're in over 50 countries throughout the

57
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,280
world.

58
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:19,400
We're very heavily invested in Latin and Central America and South America as well obviously

59
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,480
as Canada.

60
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,800
And really our businesses on a major growth curve in the Americas in general, not just

61
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,840
Canada.

62
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:35,840
We've been, you know, like many banks traditionally, we've been doing kind of segment oriented historical

63
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:43,200
analytics and, you know, we use those analytics primarily to make offers to our clients.

64
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:51,360
Over the last few years, we started the curve of automation of work and automation of

65
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,240
processes and kind of six sigma approach to things.

66
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,360
And along with that, we through our work with Pega, we actually started using their real

67
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,520
time decision, which is integrated with their process engine.

68
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:10,200
And so what we're finding is along with, you know, better real time decisions, and I'll

69
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:13,560
talk about that in a second, but along with better real time decisions, we actually are

70
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:17,760
able to action things and, you know, drive work in our back end system.

71
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,320
So as an example, you know, when an offer is taken up, we can actually automate the process

72
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:29,160
of onboarding that product or that client or whatever it is that came out of the offer.

73
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:36,760
We have, you know, we've started to move from offers that are, as I said, based on kind

74
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,560
of batch data and historical data and, you know, the data on our existing systems.

75
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,720
And we've started to augment them with more real time data.

76
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,480
So streaming data from various, you know, social media and websites and things like that.

77
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,040
And what it's giving us is the ability to make a more fulsome decision on behalf of the

78
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
client.

79
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:03,080
So, you know, the example I give people is traditionally, by the time an offer was actually

80
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:09,160
presented to a client, it may be based on data that is weeks to even over a month old.

81
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,040
The offer itself could be weeks old because the cycle time to create those offers was,

82
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,320
you know, long.

83
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,800
And with the new tools that are coming out in the market, we've got the ability to be

84
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,640
much more agile. They bring the data model and the decision strategies together in one

85
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:34,080
place and make it much simpler to integrate your data and work with your strategies.

86
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,760
And so what we're now finding is that incorporating real time data and the faster turnaround

87
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:44,640
time to be able to, you know, change offers, create offers, change other decisions is

88
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:49,800
giving us the ability to, you know, be a more active participant in the conversation

89
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,720
with the client and bring them more relevant offers.

90
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,720
Okay, great. I'm really glad to hear you brooch the issue of data because that's something

91
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,480
I've been wondering about over the course of the past couple of days here at the conference.

92
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:09,880
There are a lot of interesting things happening in terms of, you know, the real time offers

93
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,840
and things like that that have been discussed in the keynotes. And one of the questions

94
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,680
running along in the back of my mind is, you know, what's really required to make this

95
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,960
happen and what are all the integration points and, you know, what kind of data does the

96
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,640
customer have to have access to and does, you know, in what ways it strikes me that

97
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:37,120
at least to some degree putting these kinds of processes in place would help them enhance

98
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,120
their data.

99
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:45,360
Absolutely. And let's just dive into your experiences around the data side of this.

100
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,360
Sure.

101
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,800
So, you know, as I said, a lot of this is driven by the quality of the data that you have

102
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,360
about your customers and traditionally, you know, large institutions have kind of taken

103
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,440
a data mining data warehouse approach to and using segmentation to look at their clients.

104
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,680
And that's great. You get a certain amount of information. You know your client from

105
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,080
patterns. They're like this. They're, you know, they're like other people that we've

106
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,320
worked with. What we're trying to do now is to get more down to an individual and a

107
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,960
behavioral understanding of our clients. So we're, you know, and this is a multi-year

108
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,360
journey. You don't do this overnight, obviously.

109
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,560
And is that, if I can interrupt, is that fundamentally that individual view of the customer fundamentally

110
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,520
at odds with the notion of a data warehouse?

111
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,880
I would say that you're not going to achieve it with a data warehouse. Data warehouses

112
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,880
are historical data by nature. And what we're trying to do, we certainly still embrace

113
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,840
the data that we have historically about our clients and the data that we, you know, accumulate

114
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,080
in doing our day-to-day business with our clients. That's still very important. And, you

115
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:58,760
know, without that, you can't make good decisions. However, beyond that, we're now trying to

116
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:04,560
reach out into, you know, partner networks, understanding, you know, not just things like

117
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,120
account balances, you know, basic demographics, but transaction patterns, deposit patterns,

118
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,640
payment patterns. And then beyond that, you know, social media, things that they're doing

119
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,240
online. An example might be, you know, you want to make an offer to a client for a credit

120
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,240
card. That's great.

121
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,400
Wouldn't it be interesting to know that your client travels a lot, or is, in fact, traveling

122
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:37,320
as, in fact, planning a major travel event right now? If you see them online doing foreign

123
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,480
currency rate checks or online looking for airline tickets, well, that might change your

124
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:50,560
offer from, you know, an affinity points to something related with travel benefits, things

125
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,120
like that will happen, okay?

126
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:59,720
Actually, that example resonates with me quite strongly because I do travel a lot. And

127
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,640
when I see, you know, I get the credit card offers like everyone else does. And I, when

128
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,960
I see one that is not, has no kind of points associated with it or something like, what

129
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:12,600
are they thinking? Why would you, why would I even do this exactly?

130
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,080
So if on top of that, you know that your, your bank understands a little bit about your

131
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,600
life and is making offers that are more relevant to you, then, you know, your affinity to the

132
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:28,760
bank grows. So, you know, one of the speakers at the conference yesterday was talking about,

133
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,920
you know, customer satisfaction. We've got to move beyond customer satisfaction because

134
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,760
everyone is satisfying customers. And, you know, a satisfied customer does not necessarily

135
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,600
mean a customer that's going to stay with you. You've got to kind of go beyond that. And,

136
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:49,040
you know, especially the, the changing demographics of our customer base, people expect us to

137
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,120
know more about them. It's, it's not even a question of, you know, telling us about themselves.

138
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:59,120
They expect you to just know these things. And so, and it goes beyond offers, in fact.

139
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:06,040
So if you think about it, being able to give your customer a nudge because you see that

140
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,960
they're getting into a situation where they may have a check bounce, you, you're seeing

141
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,840
the patterns of deposits and expenditures, maybe even the patterns of things that are coming

142
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,200
in on credit cards. And you know, you know, you've got a payment coming do. You really need

143
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,600
to think about making that payment to avoid a late charge. Those kinds of nudges are considered

144
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,640
value add by clients. So, being able to say things like that actually makes you more of a,

145
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,840
a source of financial advice, more of a partner than just a bank selling them products. So,

146
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:42,360
that's kind of the next wave of what we're hoping to get into is more value add or advice based

147
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:48,040
interactions with our clients. And that kind of goes hand in glove with the automation of work

148
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,800
because if you think about it, where, where the tendency is to automate the repetitive tasks

149
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,600
that we do for our clients. And what that does is it frees our people up to be better financial

150
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,560
advisors. If you add the intelligence behind that to, you know, make more pertinent offers,

151
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:10,120
give nudges to your customers, then it changes the transaction between the bank and the customer

152
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,960
from one of just order taking and fulfilling requests to one of actually offering advice and

153
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:20,520
engaging the client. That's the direction we're trying to go with analytics and decisioning.

154
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:29,160
And so, you mentioned pulling in different types of data, transactional, historical transactional

155
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:36,040
data, social streaming real-time. When I hear this type of data mix, I start to think of data

156
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:41,480
like, does that play into it at all for you? It does. You know, we don't necessarily use the

157
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,560
term data lake for, but for sure there is the idea of, you know, gathering data. And in fact,

158
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:52,920
by the way, the data that we gather includes the customer journeys that we're doing through the

159
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,320
process automation of the decisions and the, you know, interaction history that we have with

160
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,840
the client through making offers and giving nudges. So, all of the data that we're getting from

161
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:08,120
all these different sources, including the data that we transact with the customer on a

162
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,360
day-to-day basis is being captured and being in some ways curated for different uses and

163
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,920
different purposes. And, you know, one of the things that we're curating for is making better

164
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,680
decisions and offering our clients better services and products. So, yes, the concept of a data lake

165
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:31,400
definitely plays a key role in this. And in some ways, it's at the base of the pyramid of

166
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,920
value-add decision. Because I like to say that, you know, it all starts with data from your own

167
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,360
backend systems and real-time data and all these things. And it goes up to, you know, kind of

168
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,560
understanding insights and intents about your client, knowing, you know, what the most probable

169
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:53,560
next interaction is going to be with your client. Or having the insights to say, I understand where

170
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:59,560
they are in their life or in their financial situation and I can therefore make better offers to

171
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:06,840
them or interact with them more intelligently. So, it goes from data to intents and insights

172
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,360
up to decisions and then up to offers and actions. So, the top of the pyramid is actually doing

173
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:20,280
something for your client. I got to say that when I'm here and I hear your vent you and, you know,

174
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:27,080
other banks have presented, telcos have presented. You've all described this world that sounds,

175
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:32,200
you know, awesome. Like the companies that I'm dealing with know what I'm going to need

176
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,360
before I express the need or even, you know, as I'm contacting them. I don't feel like any of

177
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,800
the companies I do business with actually do that. Is it, you know, just where we are in kind

178
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:50,760
of the maturity cycle? Is it that I'm just working with? I have the wrong banks and telcos and,

179
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,520
you know, all of that. Is it that this stuff is being, is it currently deployed in like small

180
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:02,760
numbers today? That's a very good question. So, for sure we're on a journey. Some of the presenters

181
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,920
today we're talking about having been working on these things for 10 years. Again, this is not

182
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,920
something you, you can create the roadmap. You can have the concepts. It actually takes a great

183
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:19,160
deal of work by many different groups around the bank to make these things happen. So, as I said,

184
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:25,880
we're, we're right now in a period where, you know, there's a lot of creation of new technologies.

185
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,280
These things are coming up all the time. You've got things like, you know, transcription,

186
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:37,240
voice transcription, natural language processing, sentiment analysis. You've got the tools are

187
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:45,400
coming available now. At the moment, many of these tools are still kind of here and there. You've

188
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,400
got to figure out how to work with them, figure out how to integrate them into your ecosystem

189
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:55,320
and into your architecture. So, some of it is just that because of the level of maturity of these

190
00:15:55,320 --> 00:16:01,560
tools, it takes a lot of work and a lot of, you know, experimentation to use these technologies.

191
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:07,000
Now, what I think is going to happen is the creative process will continue. There will begin to

192
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,360
be consolidation and you'll start to see platforms and actually Pega is one of those platforms that

193
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,520
saying, we've got the core decision and capability and we've got the core of being able to do work.

194
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:24,040
They're integrating right now with all of these other technologies and it takes work and it takes

195
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,800
time and getting your data layer really nailed down takes time and work and a lot of analysis.

196
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,120
There's data scientists and data engineers working flat out on that at our bank.

197
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:40,440
And then what's going to start to happen is we've got pockets of success areas where we're doing

198
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,960
this and we're experimenting in other areas. So, you know, we're talking about how to do things

199
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:51,400
in customer service, how to do things in the world of collections or fraud. We're not yet at a

200
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:57,000
point where we're just doing it full out, but we are definitely focusing on it and moving in that

201
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,360
direction. So, you mentioned some of your data science teams and data engineering teams.

202
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:08,680
What are they focused on now to try to help the enterprise get to this broader vision of

203
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,640
real-time decision automation? Right. What are their big challenges? I think

204
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,920
master data management is definitely big challenge like knowing that you've got the right copy

205
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:25,400
of every field of data you have on your customers. You know, as I said, data lineage or data

206
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,240
provenance, making sure that you understand where data came from, where the roots of it are,

207
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,040
so that you use it correctly. These are some of the industry wide challenges that I think people

208
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,840
are going through. And then, quite frankly, learning the new technologies that allow us to work with

209
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,800
data in more agile and more real-time ways. You're not going to do this with classic relational

210
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,280
databases. There are new technologies that are coming up and the banks adopting them. Well,

211
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:54,760
industry is adopting those. So, I think the discipline of data engineering and data sciences

212
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,640
is, again, evolving and growing, but it's definitely reaching a level of maturity where there

213
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,280
are experts in the field. And there is real thought leadership. It's not, you know, guys like me

214
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:09,000
going in and saying, I'm going to invent data engineering. It's there. It's a university discipline

215
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,960
and we get to benefit from that now. For sure, there's a road map ahead of us to really nail down

216
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:23,320
our data challenges. What are some of the technologies that are kind of on your radar at that data

217
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,720
layer for helping you get to? Yeah. So, I mean, all the classic ones, you know, the Hadoop type

218
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,760
data tools. Well, let's put it this way. We're looking at all sorts of different technologies

219
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,960
that probably don't want to talk about the ones we're specifically looking at. But a lot of the

220
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,400
you know, the cloud-based tools and the big data tools where we're investigating many of those

221
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,800
and trying to choose the right ones for our mission. You mentioned cloud. There's been historically

222
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:59,240
hesitation on the part of large enterprises, particularly banks and others to embrace cloud.

223
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,400
I'm curious what if you can comment on Scotia's particular take on on cloud.

224
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,480
Yeah. Well, we're definitely focused on it. I think all the big banks are focused on cloud.

225
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,440
It's perceived with caution. There's no question about that. You know, the big challenge that I think

226
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:21,080
all corporations are having right now, not just banks, is protecting our customers data. So,

227
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:27,640
obviously, that's always going to be primary in our mind. So, the way we're, you know, approaching

228
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:35,320
the cloud is cloud in general is an untrusted zone by nature, the native cloud. And so, we have to

229
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:42,200
build the capabilities and the security mechanisms that will allow us to gradually move in that

230
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:48,440
direction. It's a very big question for banks and large corporations. And, you know, above all,

231
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,560
banks are going to move very cautiously in that direction. So, some of the capabilities of

232
00:19:53,560 --> 00:20:00,600
the cloud we are exploiting, but only in very specific ways to always put first our customers

233
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:07,080
protection. Sure, sure. And if you looked at some of the data science, machine learning AI,

234
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:13,560
offerings that the cloud vendors are coming online with in particular. We have. And for sure,

235
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,800
you know, some of these capabilities, again, we're seeing them here at Pegaworld.

236
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:25,560
You know, machine learning is a big area. It's a big push. I would say, you know, we're

237
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,440
working with it. We're experimenting with it. And again, having pockets of success with it,

238
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:35,240
but in general, for us right now, we're starting at the bottom of the pyramid and making sure

239
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,960
we have, you know, our data layer just right and then understand how to draw the insights and

240
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,680
intents out of that. Machine learning comes a little bit later down the road when you know you've

241
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:49,400
got your decision models working the way you want them. And then you just, you know, again,

242
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,600
you've got to have that transparency of as I'm learning, I need to be able to track where this

243
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,240
thing is going because you've always got compliance and audit issues to be able to say why was

244
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,600
any particular decision made. So, machine learning is another area where we're going to proceed

245
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:11,160
with great caution. And we're going to, you know, understand it very well before we start making

246
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:17,720
the making choices about how to use it. Maybe going back to the underlying data discussion.

247
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:24,200
One of the things that you mentioned that was interesting was you, you've got this historical

248
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,040
data, you've got the social data again. And then you've got this notion of the customer journey.

249
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:37,960
And I'm wondering, does that notion of the customer journey, does it exist some place as a thing?

250
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,960
And like what is its native form and where does it live? Is it, you know, is it Justin Pegas? Is it,

251
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:49,800
you know, something that you store in some database or is it, you know, created on the fly every time

252
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:56,360
from all these different pieces and parts? That's a great question. I think it's a virtual concept

253
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,160
for sure. We don't have a customer journey database and we don't have a customer journey tool.

254
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,360
It's really something that we work on with the business. So the business obviously is the one

255
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,040
who draws the customer journeys and understands them and we support them in that analysis.

256
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:21,400
But what I would say is it's kind of built into our decision capabilities. It's built into our

257
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:27,080
processes and it's, it's embodied in all of our systems. As, you know, every time we're building

258
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:32,760
new systems, those systems represent points on the customer journey. And so that data that comes

259
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,040
out of those systems goes back into our data layer and eventually you will have something that is

260
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:44,440
sort of a record of customer journeys, if you will. But the actual work that's done on behalf

261
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,520
of the customer, the decisions that are made on behalf of the customer, those are embedded in our

262
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:53,640
systems. So the concept is virtual, but there are very real artifacts of it all over the bank.

263
00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:02,120
What are some of the, what are some of the areas that are kind of most exciting for you as you both

264
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:07,480
here at the conference, you kind of see what is happening with, you know, one of your key vendors

265
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:13,960
in this space as well as just in the broader industry, you know, as machine learning AI and other

266
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:23,160
things are evolving. Well, so I'm particularly interested in this concept of customer centricity.

267
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:28,200
And it's a big theme in many of the vendors and many of the companies that are working with

268
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,640
customer data. And for me, it's, it's going to be a real challenge to kind of step out of the

269
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:41,400
comfort zone of being a product oriented or, you know, historically companies sell products and

270
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:47,560
services. And of course, we'll always sell products and services. However, customer centricity

271
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:55,800
challenges us to start looking at differently at the way we bring our products and services to

272
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:03,000
the customers. So, you know, as I always say, banks are not, are not missions, but we are customer

273
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,520
focused organizations. And increasingly, your focus on the customers, what's going to be the

274
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,000
deciding factor in whether customers stay with you or not? Customers are becoming much more

275
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,480
demanding over time as well as they should. There's more technology and more capabilities at their

276
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:24,920
disposal. So, this idea that, you know, if you, if you look across an organization, you look across

277
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:30,840
all of their systems, you've got decisions being made on behalf of your customer all over the place.

278
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,120
And some of them are manual, you know, we're doing things in contact centers and branches and,

279
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,720
you know, we got financial advisors. And some of them are just embedded in codified in our

280
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:50,920
systems. And so, the idea that we want to start to have some kind of a holistic capability to

281
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:56,200
think about our customer and to bring things to our customers, that's going to be a huge challenge

282
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:02,440
for, for large corporations. And, you know, we're out there now increasingly competing with

283
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:08,040
non-banks. And non-banks have all sorts of, you know, new technologies at their disposal. So,

284
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:13,400
we've got to be able to compete with them on the same terms. So, being more customer-centric

285
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:20,280
will definitely play a role in that competitive challenge. A quick question on that, that point.

286
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:27,960
You mentioned that a big part of customer-centricity is having a holistic view of the customer.

287
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:34,680
Does that necessarily mean centralized or must it in fact remain decentralized and we just have to

288
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:41,640
deal with that? I think just the nature of our systems is that you'll never have a perfect customer

289
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,320
data record. That's not going to exist. But the idea. And even the specific thing that you were

290
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:55,400
talking about that triggered this question was around the different points that customer-related

291
00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:01,400
decisions were being made. Like, is it, you know, as part of the vision of, you know, what you're

292
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:09,400
doing around decision automation to like have a single place where customer decisions are made?

293
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,200
Or I don't, again, I don't know forever, have a single place where customer decisions are made,

294
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:21,240
but to the extent that we can coordinate better the touch points with the customer,

295
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,080
I think that's going to be a really important advance in technology. So it's an interest for me.

296
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,680
I think that if you just put yourself in the customer's shoes for a minute and if you're

297
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:39,320
receiving multiple offers from the companies that you do business with and they may be

298
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,360
similar enough for your wondering why are you sending me two offers for credit cards? I don't

299
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:51,160
need two credit cards. Maybe I need one, right? Or, you know, you're offering me a credit card on this hand

300
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:55,240
and I'm talking to you about a mortgage on that hand. How are these two things going to affect

301
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:02,120
each other? So I think to the extent that we can centralize at least the direct customer touch points

302
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,920
and, you know, coordinate those and have an arbiter of, you know, customer focus. I think that

303
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:14,680
will be a big advance that's going to come in the next few years so that we really look like when

304
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:18,760
you're dealing with a bank, even if you're dealing with different people, you're dealing with one

305
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:26,120
bank. That's kind of the point. Okay, and you were getting to AI. Yeah, so I think for AI,

306
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,000
and, you know, I was sitting on a board with a few guys talking about this a little bit earlier,

307
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,800
we're mastering historical data now and we're making real-time decisions, as I said, instead of

308
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:44,040
segmented decisions and things like that. So I think we're getting to the point where we can make

309
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:49,160
the best decision, make the best interaction or have the best moment with the customer now. Okay,

310
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,640
we're getting better at the historical aspect of that and the real-time aspect. So we've overcome

311
00:27:53,640 --> 00:28:02,040
that first challenge. But I think a next challenge is going to be having better models for understanding

312
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:08,280
how the decisions we're making with our customer right now will impact them and us in the future.

313
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:15,800
So again, the example I was giving today in discussion was if I'm offering a credit card,

314
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:22,200
how's that going to impact the propensity to get a mortgage later? Or, you know, if I know that

315
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:27,000
that customer may be in the market for a new car loan in another year, is that credit card going

316
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,520
to impact that new car loan? What's the right offer for them and for the bank to maximize that

317
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:38,680
overall equation? So I think, you know, there will be a point in time where we start looking forward

318
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,840
and saying, how do we model out? You know, what's the next step in the customer journey? Not just

319
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,640
the previous step and the current step. I think that's going to be a really interesting set of

320
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:52,840
questions that are brought up and discussed over the next couple of years. I've had a number of

321
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:59,080
conversations with folks and it always strikes me that, you know, just where we are in the process,

322
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:05,640
we're optimizing around, you know, very much low-hanging fruit like, you know, these kind of

323
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:13,480
incremental decisions or very simple metrics that don't necessarily tie to kind of the long-term,

324
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,840
big picture, total lifetime value of a customer relationship, for example. That's way out of

325
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,560
scope for what most people are thinking about today. That's true. If you think about the financial

326
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,400
markets, part of my history was doing modeling of financial instruments and I used to, you know,

327
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,280
model balance sheets for banks and things like that. You know, you're always looking forward

328
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:40,040
and you're looking at things like volatility curves and forward curves on underlying assets

329
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:44,440
and things like that. And then you're modeling and you're saying, well, you know, things can happen.

330
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,160
I'll model out into the future and I'll take the expected value of that or I'll, you know,

331
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,200
adjust it for probabilities, et cetera. And I bring it back and I say, what's the best decision

332
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,960
to make looking out into the future? Well, you know, we are financial actors in our customers'

333
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,360
lives. So at some point, you want to be able to take that same look forward and say, you know,

334
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,480
this decision or this offer or whatever it is, is going to have an impact on them and is going to

335
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:15,160
have expected value to us. So why don't we find a way to start looking forward a little bit and see

336
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:20,120
if, you know, it's the right decision now and the right decision for the future. And I think that's

337
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,360
going to be a whole big area of analysis and learning over the next several years.

338
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:31,880
So we talk quite a bit about the way the data tier needs to enable this and some of the things

339
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:37,560
you're doing. You're looking into the future. How do you see that data tier evolving to

340
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:43,320
meet all of these needs? Good question. I don't know. I think, as I said, I think this is going to

341
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:49,240
be something that evolves over time and the questions will be asked and answered by people who are

342
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:55,960
smarter than I am. But I do think that there will start getting into a little bit of, you know,

343
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,960
profiling of, you know, people and how they work and how they live and how they, you know,

344
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,440
use financial instruments and saying, you know, the average customer who takes financial instrument

345
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:11,080
like this when they're at this point in their life uses it in these ways. So you'll model around

346
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:15,960
that and probably have some kind of statistical modeling around it and then bring it back and say

347
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,720
it's our belief that this is the tool that will take you forward in this way. And again, I don't

348
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,560
know, but I do know that financial modeling is normally to go forward with an expected curve and then

349
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:34,680
apply, you know, kind of statistical methods around that expected curve and say, you know,

350
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:39,160
randomly things happen. How do we bring it back and understand the impact on today?

351
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:45,000
Awesome. Awesome. Well, Jim, thanks so much for taking the time to sit down with me.

352
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:54,360
Any final thoughts or any words of wisdom for enterprises and financial services or

353
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,400
in other industries that are just starting out down this journey?

354
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:02,520
I think if I was, and again, I've been in the field for a long time, I've been 30 years,

355
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:09,400
you know, in the IT world, I think what I would say is the game changer now is that the customer

356
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:15,160
is really in charge. The customer is sophisticated. They know that we've got all kinds of capabilities

357
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:20,440
and all kinds of data. They're expecting us to use it to mutual benefit of ours and theirs.

358
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,480
And so, you know, anything you're doing, if you're doing it on behalf of your customer,

359
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:29,560
it's, you know, it's the right path. You got to keep the customer in the center.

360
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,440
Awesome. Awesome. Well, thanks so much, Jim. Pleasure to meet you.
