00:00.000 --> 00:16.320
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

00:16.320 --> 00:21.480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:21.480 --> 00:31.800
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.880
Over the past few months we've been working hard to craft an agenda for Twimblecon AI

00:35.880 --> 00:40.680
platforms that's both practical and interactive and I encourage you to check out what we've

00:40.680 --> 00:45.600
pulled together over at Twimblecon.com if you haven't recently.

00:45.600 --> 00:50.760
But Twimblecon is about more than great content, it's also about community and in that vein

00:50.760 --> 00:54.960
we'll be creating numerous opportunities for attendees to engage with one another and

00:54.960 --> 00:57.480
the broader Twimble universe.

00:57.480 --> 01:02.560
One of the things I am most excited about is that at Twimblecon we'll be joined by a bunch

01:02.560 --> 01:05.360
of formal Twimble podcast guests.

01:05.360 --> 01:09.520
This esteemed group will be there to take in all that Twimblecon has to offer including

01:09.520 --> 01:14.760
the opportunity to learn from and share their experiences with the entire AI platforms

01:14.760 --> 01:16.080
community.

01:16.080 --> 01:19.160
We'll be hosting an unconference at Twimblecon as well.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.760
This is a community driven segment of the event where attendees will have the opportunity

01:22.760 --> 01:27.760
to propose and vote on topics that they want to further explore in small group discussions

01:27.760 --> 01:29.280
and presentations.

01:29.280 --> 01:34.400
Finally, after kicking off the first day with great keynote interviews and breakout sessions

01:34.400 --> 01:38.680
we wanted to make sure that attendees have the opportunity to unwind and connect.

01:38.680 --> 01:45.360
Plus, we also want it and excuse to celebrate our first conference third birthday and 300th

01:45.360 --> 01:47.280
episode of the podcast.

01:47.280 --> 01:52.200
Also we'll be concluding day one with a Twimblecon happy hour par day.

01:52.200 --> 01:56.880
Of course, there will be food and drinks but also fun activities like an AWS deep racer

01:56.880 --> 02:02.520
contest, a Twimble interview booth and photo booth, a DJ and more.

02:02.520 --> 02:05.040
You definitely don't want to miss out.

02:05.040 --> 02:11.120
There's still time to register at Twimblecon.com which takes place on October 1st and 2nd in San

02:11.120 --> 02:19.160
Francisco, hit pause now and head over to twimblecon.com slash register to secure your spot.

02:19.160 --> 02:22.480
We'll wait for you.

02:22.480 --> 02:23.480
Great.

02:23.480 --> 02:30.600
Now that you're all registered and ready to go, please enjoy today's show.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.360
All right everyone, I am on the line with Greg Wilcox.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.360
Greg is director of R&D at unanimous AI.

02:36.360 --> 02:38.920
Greg, welcome to this week in machine learning and AI.

02:38.920 --> 02:39.920
Hi.

02:39.920 --> 02:40.920
Thanks for having me.

02:40.920 --> 02:41.920
Absolutely.

02:41.920 --> 02:42.920
Absolutely.

02:42.920 --> 02:49.240
So before we started this call, I went over to your LinkedIn and saw that you did your

02:49.240 --> 02:54.960
thing undergrad and grad work at Wash You in St. Louis, which I'm in St. Louis recording

02:54.960 --> 02:58.120
this as we speak and based here in St. Louis.

02:58.120 --> 02:59.120
Yeah.

02:59.120 --> 03:03.440
So maybe tell us a little bit about your your background and kind of how you got started

03:03.440 --> 03:04.440
in AI.

03:04.440 --> 03:05.440
Sure.

03:05.440 --> 03:06.840
Yeah, absolutely.

03:06.840 --> 03:12.000
So I got started, I was doing my bachelor's in systems engineering and physics at Wash

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
You.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.320
And I was really enjoying it.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.520
And I had the opportunity to do my masters there as well.

03:17.520 --> 03:20.440
And I wanted to get into robotics.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.160
Robotics had always interest me.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.680
I had done some electrical engineering and my dad's an electrical engineer.

03:26.680 --> 03:31.960
And I got thinking and started like doing some research and artificial intelligence

03:31.960 --> 03:32.960
as a result.

03:32.960 --> 03:38.640
Robotics research is focused around machine learning and obviously artificial intelligence.

03:38.640 --> 03:42.360
So through that process, I took a couple of machine learning courses, got more and more

03:42.360 --> 03:43.360
interested.

03:43.360 --> 03:49.800
And obviously started hearing about things like like deep learning and AlphaGo and stuff

03:49.800 --> 03:50.800
like that.

03:50.800 --> 03:55.640
Obviously, just super motivating results that I think a lot of students these days are

03:55.640 --> 04:01.480
noticing and taking note of and really motivating them to get started in AI research.

04:01.480 --> 04:06.520
So I followed that same path and got my masters in robotics from Wash You.

04:06.520 --> 04:12.080
And then, yeah, and then joined unanimous tell us a little bit about what unanimous is

04:12.080 --> 04:13.080
up to.

04:13.080 --> 04:19.560
I'm looking at this paper that you wrote with the CEO and founder of the company Lewis Rosenberg

04:19.560 --> 04:22.720
on artificial swarm intelligence.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.720
What is that?

04:23.720 --> 04:26.760
And what are you trying to do at the company?

04:26.760 --> 04:28.160
Yeah, absolutely.

04:28.160 --> 04:35.120
So most AI companies take the approach that we can use artificial intelligence and machine

04:35.120 --> 04:41.800
learning to automate human processes, right, to do things that are easy or hard to do,

04:41.800 --> 04:48.040
but that are fairly automatable, such as making predictions or learning about the world and

04:48.040 --> 04:50.480
making decisions as a result of that.

04:50.480 --> 04:55.280
At unanimous, we treat humans a little differently, right, rather than data labelled, rather than

04:55.280 --> 04:59.320
as data labellers, we think that humans are really, really fundamentally very smart and

04:59.320 --> 05:04.040
have knowledge and wisdom about the world that state of the art machine learning algorithms

05:04.040 --> 05:06.160
just don't have access to you.

05:06.160 --> 05:13.880
And so by thinking about humans in this way, by thinking about them as really, really smart,

05:13.880 --> 05:17.800
we can actually use them as data processors rather than data points.

05:17.800 --> 05:23.360
So when you're, as one example, when you're on surfing Google, Google's tracking your

05:23.360 --> 05:28.040
clicks, they're treating your behaviors as just a data point.

05:28.040 --> 05:33.360
And trying to learn, like, market using machine learning algorithms to market to you based

05:33.360 --> 05:36.640
on your data points that you leave behind.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.440
We do things very differently.

05:38.440 --> 05:44.240
We connect people using AI algorithms and allow them to think together as a group.

05:44.240 --> 05:48.800
So what we've, like, we've devised this swarm AI algorithm that's based off of algorithms

05:48.800 --> 05:55.760
and nature that allow human groups to make more optimal forecasts, decisions, or prioritizations.

05:55.760 --> 06:01.000
And it's all really based on this idea in nature that organisms are better collectively

06:01.000 --> 06:02.960
thinking than thinking alone.

06:02.960 --> 06:08.480
And some examples of that are bees, fish, schools of fish, flocks of birds.

06:08.480 --> 06:14.360
All of these natural organisms have developed systems that allow themselves to think together

06:14.360 --> 06:17.240
more accurately than individuals.

06:17.240 --> 06:22.720
So a bee, when trying to be colony, when trying to think about, well, where should we position

06:22.720 --> 06:24.320
our hive next year?

06:24.320 --> 06:27.360
A single bee just can't make that decision.

06:27.360 --> 06:29.640
They're just not intelligent enough.

06:29.640 --> 06:33.240
They have a brain, the size of a grain of rice.

06:33.240 --> 06:36.960
And so they can't think of, oh, there are 17 different locations and let's weigh those

06:36.960 --> 06:43.080
on different factors, including the height from the ground, the size of the hive itself,

06:43.080 --> 06:44.200
et cetera, et cetera.

06:44.200 --> 06:49.520
So the individuals are not smart enough to make this decision accurately.

06:49.520 --> 06:52.400
And so what they do is they form this real-time system.

06:52.400 --> 06:59.760
They actually, an immersion intelligence forms because the group thinks together as a whole.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.960
And the way they do that is by communicating.

07:01.960 --> 07:06.480
They form a swarm intelligence by almost debating the answers in real time.

07:06.480 --> 07:11.600
I don't know if you're familiar with a waggle dance, but essentially they are dancing

07:11.600 --> 07:16.920
to express their conviction in a certain site.

07:16.920 --> 07:22.640
Yeah, so bees do this in one way, fish to another way, birds do it in a different way.

07:22.640 --> 07:28.600
But really what we see is that these real-time systems of independent thinkers and decision

07:28.600 --> 07:32.760
makers, the real-time systems, there's a whole form of smarter, super intelligence,

07:32.760 --> 07:38.240
a hive mind that is smarter than the individuals in the group.

07:38.240 --> 07:44.200
And so we based our technology off that phenomenon called swarm intelligence.

07:44.200 --> 07:49.640
And all we do is because humans hasn't evolved that method themselves of forming swarms,

07:49.640 --> 07:53.640
we've created an artificial swarm intelligence, which is really connecting humans with an

07:53.640 --> 08:00.160
AI algorithm so that the humans can become a hive mind.

08:00.160 --> 08:04.600
They can group together into hive mind that is more accurate as a whole than any individual

08:04.600 --> 08:08.440
as a group, or then the group as just as if they were taking a vote.

08:08.440 --> 08:15.520
I don't think anyone would argue your kind of base premises that humans are smart and

08:15.520 --> 08:21.160
that they communicate and when they communicate they can make each other smarter or make better

08:21.160 --> 08:24.120
decisions, things like that.

08:24.120 --> 08:32.160
Beyond that though, the notion of kind of this confluence of swarm and AI is still abstract.

08:32.160 --> 08:35.440
How can we make that more concrete?

08:35.440 --> 08:36.440
Sure.

08:36.440 --> 08:41.000
So you can think of language as one form of swarming.

08:41.000 --> 08:44.680
So you can think that when we're communicating everyone is thinking together as a group,

08:44.680 --> 08:47.560
let's say we're a group of five people trying to make a decision.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.000
We would start talking and coming up with the best answer.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.080
So that's a form of swarming.

08:52.080 --> 08:57.200
The problem is, it's basically a focus group or a debate.

08:57.200 --> 09:02.680
The loudest person in the room exerts the most influence, our biases come into play.

09:02.680 --> 09:09.240
So age, ethnicity, the background of a human determines how you judge that human.

09:09.240 --> 09:13.320
And so realistically, that's not an effective form of decision making.

09:13.320 --> 09:19.040
The groups, insights are not aggregated in a good way.

09:19.040 --> 09:23.880
So what we've done is we've designed a graphical interface, an online interface in which all

09:23.880 --> 09:26.160
participants are anonymous.

09:26.160 --> 09:31.400
And this interface contains a puck and everyone has a magnet that they can pull on a puck

09:31.400 --> 09:32.400
on the puck.

09:32.400 --> 09:37.600
And so in an anonymous way, in a very democratic way, where everyone's exerting influence

09:37.600 --> 09:44.880
in real time synchronously, we can reach optimal decisions collectively together.

09:44.880 --> 09:50.240
So it's an anonymous democratic form of communication.

09:50.240 --> 09:55.040
So we've got a decision that needs to be made.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.320
Where should we build our hive?

09:57.320 --> 10:03.880
We've all got, say, there are half a dozen options and we've all got access to some magnets

10:03.880 --> 10:07.440
where we can pull this puck.

10:07.440 --> 10:13.560
It sounds like you're, it's kind of a sophisticated voting scheme in some way.

10:13.560 --> 10:14.560
Sure.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.160
Yeah, you can consider it.

10:17.160 --> 10:22.880
It's real time voting, but where the consensus is being represented on the screen.

10:22.880 --> 10:26.680
And so yeah, it's, yeah, it's similar to that.

10:26.680 --> 10:29.120
And so where does AI come into play?

10:29.120 --> 10:34.040
So what we're really doing with the AI is moderating the discussion.

10:34.040 --> 10:38.400
The puck is sort of a representation of the consensus of the swarm.

10:38.400 --> 10:44.560
And so as that approaches a target, the swarm is choosing that one as the puck approaches

10:44.560 --> 10:47.360
an answer, the swarm is choosing that answer.

10:47.360 --> 10:52.920
So where the AI really comes into play is moderating the strength of each user.

10:52.920 --> 10:58.560
So as we, as we notice, one user is more convicted than another or really, really has a strong

10:58.560 --> 11:03.560
belief in one of the answers, they'll get more strength and more weight into the decision

11:03.560 --> 11:06.000
or forecast.

11:06.000 --> 11:12.280
And so we've designed a number of AI algorithms that using this graphical interface sort

11:12.280 --> 11:14.200
of measure users' conviction.

11:14.200 --> 11:19.280
For example, if they're switching between multiple answers, they're probably less convicted.

11:19.280 --> 11:23.200
They've less strength of belief than someone who is pulling for the same answer in the

11:23.200 --> 11:24.600
whole swarm.

11:24.600 --> 11:28.640
Someone that's really entrenched and really, really wants one answer is more convicted than

11:28.640 --> 11:30.920
someone who's wishy-washy.

11:30.920 --> 11:35.200
So we have some algorithms that measure conviction in that way.

11:35.200 --> 11:39.400
Another one is that you really have to be close to this puck with your magnet, the closer

11:39.400 --> 11:42.000
your magnet, the more force you have.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.800
The problem is the puck moving.

11:43.800 --> 11:48.360
And so you have to be really thinking and really putting effort into controlling the location

11:48.360 --> 11:51.680
of your magnet, really trying to pull as hard as you can at all times.

11:51.680 --> 11:58.080
And that dynamic system, really, we've shown that it is very useful in finding the conviction

11:58.080 --> 11:59.080
of a user.

11:59.080 --> 12:03.240
The user that are more convicted will put more effort and mentally into trying to exert

12:03.240 --> 12:05.160
their will on the puck.

12:05.160 --> 12:10.480
And so when we're talking about moving this puck, are we talking about with a video game

12:10.480 --> 12:17.760
controller or like slamming down on the down arrow keys or just using your mouse or using

12:17.760 --> 12:18.760
your mouse?

12:18.760 --> 12:21.440
So you're physically doing some action.

12:21.440 --> 12:27.920
So this is kind of like a real time voting thing where you've got, I'm trying to remember

12:27.920 --> 12:31.200
the name of this video game that I'm thinking about where you have like multiple players

12:31.200 --> 12:36.400
and you end up like, it has one of these track balls and you just end up slamming this

12:36.400 --> 12:40.400
track ball as hard as you can to try to move whatever it is in your direction.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.440
Like, that's the picture that's forming for me.

12:43.440 --> 12:44.440
Yeah.

12:44.440 --> 12:49.520
So it's, I think rather than slamming a track ball, it's pretty calm and it's pretty fun.

12:49.520 --> 12:52.000
Users really enjoy using the system, I think.

12:52.000 --> 12:59.080
Yeah, but I think it is like a very engaging experience where people really are like, are

12:59.080 --> 13:03.040
feel a sense of emotion when the swarm is not going their way and they're really forced

13:03.040 --> 13:07.480
to think about the options it played and how they can reach and answer that's good for

13:07.480 --> 13:09.720
them, even if it's not their best answer.

13:09.720 --> 13:14.120
And so it's about at this game of compromise, a game is maybe a good word for it when

13:14.120 --> 13:19.440
we're thinking about compromise and entrenchment and all these human factors.

13:19.440 --> 13:23.800
So it really at the end of the day comes back to humans and emotions.

13:23.800 --> 13:30.920
So you mentioned compromise and previously you mentioned that the part of the dynamic

13:30.920 --> 13:40.320
of this game or system is that the more convicted user, you know, gets more strength and has

13:40.320 --> 13:44.440
more greater ability to influence the outcome.

13:44.440 --> 13:49.880
You know, if the political climate is any indication, you know, strength of conviction

13:49.880 --> 13:57.040
isn't necessarily tied to, you know, judgment or, you know, willingness to compromise.

13:57.040 --> 14:00.080
How does that play out in this environment?

14:00.080 --> 14:05.080
Yeah, so well, strength of conviction isn't always correlated to accuracy.

14:05.080 --> 14:09.720
In general, we find that it is specifically when there's a, when we're forecasting.

14:09.720 --> 14:17.080
So if we're like trying to forecast the outcome of a sports game, generally we find that

14:17.080 --> 14:20.840
the strength of someone's conviction is correlated to their accuracy.

14:20.840 --> 14:25.040
People who don't know what they're talking about are more likely to switch than people

14:25.040 --> 14:28.000
who do know what they're talking about.

14:28.000 --> 14:31.240
All that in certain cases is not true.

14:31.240 --> 14:34.480
As a general rule, we find it to be the case.

14:34.480 --> 14:35.480
And you mentioned sports.

14:35.480 --> 14:41.000
Maybe that's a good segue to talking about some use cases that will help make this even

14:41.000 --> 14:43.760
more concrete.

14:43.760 --> 14:46.520
It sounds like you're doing some work in the sports arena.

14:46.520 --> 14:47.520
Absolutely.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.520
Yeah.

14:48.520 --> 14:56.120
So every week we predict a number of sports, the five main sports in the US, NHL, NBA,

14:56.120 --> 15:01.200
MLB, NFL, and EPL, English Premier League.

15:01.200 --> 15:06.640
We've done some really, really interesting research that shows that swarms are very,

15:06.640 --> 15:09.240
very accurate at forecasting sports.

15:09.240 --> 15:13.640
And so we're predicting March madness this year.

15:13.640 --> 15:17.800
And actually last year, maybe a good, a good point of conversation is that we went up

15:17.800 --> 15:18.800
against ESPN.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.720
And ESPN has this bracket.

15:21.720 --> 15:27.040
Anyone can make a bracket on ESPN and 17 million people did last year.

15:27.040 --> 15:32.080
What's crazy about that is that we got a group of 50 people to forecast this bracket as

15:32.080 --> 15:33.080
well.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.680
That's a full 63 games.

15:35.680 --> 15:39.240
And that's really, you have to forecast the first round then based on your picked winners

15:39.240 --> 15:42.080
from the first round or the second round.

15:42.080 --> 15:49.080
And so forecasting these 63 games, we find that the 17 million people, if you calculate

15:49.080 --> 15:52.360
their average, they would have performed in the 50th percentile.

15:52.360 --> 15:59.200
But when making a decision, when making a forecast as a swarm, we can increase the forecasting

15:59.200 --> 16:04.760
accuracy of just 50 regular fans all the way up to the 92nd percentile.

16:04.760 --> 16:09.840
So really we're aggregating the wisdom and the insights of participants to make more

16:09.840 --> 16:12.000
accurate forecasts.

16:12.000 --> 16:16.160
The point of conversation normally comes up, well, what happens if you're just taking

16:16.160 --> 16:18.480
a vote of that 17 million people, right?

16:18.480 --> 16:21.680
That's a huge base of knowledge and wisdom.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.280
How well would they have done?

16:23.280 --> 16:28.920
Well, we find that if the ESPN has a people's bracket, which is like basically a wisdom

16:28.920 --> 16:32.640
that crowd and an average of the most people's brackets.

16:32.640 --> 16:36.680
So if you had taken a vote, the people's bracket is what you would have received.

16:36.680 --> 16:39.040
And that only scored in the 60th percentile.

16:39.040 --> 16:45.200
So we get an extra 32% improvement upon that by aggregating knowledge and wisdom in

16:45.200 --> 16:51.160
a real time swarming system rather than just taking a vote.

16:51.160 --> 16:58.640
And so the 50 people that participate in this, where they somehow randomly chosen from

16:58.640 --> 17:03.040
the 17 million or is there a relationship between them?

17:03.040 --> 17:06.560
Yeah, they weren't, they were sampled from a similar population, right?

17:06.560 --> 17:09.120
They just as self identified as enthusiasts.

17:09.120 --> 17:16.000
They were not experts, they weren't paid to participate or compensated for their accuracy.

17:16.000 --> 17:22.360
They were just regular NBA fans who signed up VR and newsletter and wanted to forecast

17:22.360 --> 17:25.280
these games and see what the swarm would have predicted.

17:25.280 --> 17:34.160
And so predicting, trying to predict the outcome of sports games is one application or what

17:34.160 --> 17:35.160
are some others?

17:35.160 --> 17:36.160
Sure.

17:36.160 --> 17:42.000
So what's really powerful about this technology is that it's usable across really any domain,

17:42.000 --> 17:46.080
any question that a human can answer, a group of humans can also answer.

17:46.080 --> 17:49.720
So swarm, therefore, can also answer.

17:49.720 --> 17:55.280
So we see applications of this from sports as one example, but medical is another.

17:55.280 --> 18:02.280
We did a study with Stanford that showed we can reduce the diagnostic error of doctors

18:02.280 --> 18:05.880
by 33% when diagnosing pneumonia.

18:05.880 --> 18:14.080
We can amplify the accuracy of financial traders by 26% when thinking together as a swarm.

18:14.080 --> 18:20.200
So medicine, finance, business decision making is another where we're thinking about making

18:20.200 --> 18:25.960
business forecast or prioritizations or really decisions in a swarm.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.520
And we've shown that that's also significantly more accurate.

18:28.520 --> 18:33.200
So really the applications for this technology are vast.

18:33.200 --> 18:38.800
And so yeah, we're really at the moment hoping to bring that to more and more people.

18:38.800 --> 18:39.800
Okay.

18:39.800 --> 18:43.880
So I'm getting kind of my picture of what you're doing continues to refine.

18:43.880 --> 18:53.760
I guess my current sound bite maybe would be that it's kind of like a real time nonverbal

18:53.760 --> 19:00.320
collaboration tool in a sense where you're collaborating over or voting tool where you're

19:00.320 --> 19:05.760
like collaborating or voting on kind of simple questions as opposed to projects or something

19:05.760 --> 19:06.760
like that.

19:06.760 --> 19:07.760
Yeah.

19:07.760 --> 19:11.400
And I think collaboration is absolutely the way to think about this because we're not just

19:11.400 --> 19:12.400
taking a simple vote.

19:12.400 --> 19:17.000
We're asking people to behave like and the behaviors here are the really, really important

19:17.000 --> 19:18.000
part.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
Yeah.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.800
This maybe goes back to this idea of conviction, but do you find that is there some dynamic

19:23.800 --> 19:27.240
where a person's participation in this?

19:27.240 --> 19:30.920
Is it again like slamming the track ball as hard as you can or moving the mouse as hard

19:30.920 --> 19:41.600
as you can or just kind of in other words, as vigorously as you desire, trying to impose

19:41.600 --> 19:48.200
your conviction on the other participants or is there some kind of dynamic nature where

19:48.200 --> 19:54.640
people you've demonstrated that people see what other people are also convicted about

19:54.640 --> 19:58.920
and kind of change the way they express themselves?

19:58.920 --> 20:04.400
So we find that people are very sort of empathetic when using the system.

20:04.400 --> 20:08.960
They're more easily able to consider other people's viewpoints and so they're instead of

20:08.960 --> 20:15.160
the idea of slamming a track ball, really trying to impose your will on other people.

20:15.160 --> 20:19.720
When using the system, you only have, let's say, there are 40 people in the system, you

20:19.720 --> 20:24.440
have one 40th of the control, right?

20:24.440 --> 20:30.040
So you really are not in complete control, it's the will of that hive mind, if you will,

20:30.040 --> 20:34.480
that determines the decisions or forecasts or outputs of the system.

20:34.480 --> 20:40.320
And so really you are just a small part of a larger tool, of a larger system.

20:40.320 --> 20:45.560
And so you need to work with the system by thinking how could I best direct this towards

20:45.560 --> 20:51.000
what I would like rather than trying to exert your will on the system and make other people

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
believe you?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Yeah.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.000
And I guess that's kind of the question that I'm trying to ask, you know, and the one

20:58.000 --> 21:06.080
end, there's just, you know, say that there are, you know, six possible responses.

21:06.080 --> 21:10.600
You know, the one end is like a one-dimensional input where I'm just pressing CCC or, you

21:10.600 --> 21:15.280
know, trying to direct somehow this puck to C. But it sounds like you're describing

21:15.280 --> 21:21.680
a world in which it's almost like a strategy game in the small where I'm trying to exert

21:21.680 --> 21:27.360
influence indirectly, but it's not clear to me how that plays out in the scenarios we've

21:27.360 --> 21:28.360
talked about.

21:28.360 --> 21:29.360
Sure.

21:29.360 --> 21:30.360
Yeah.

21:30.360 --> 21:37.160
So let's imagine, let's imagine that there are three options and they're equally spaced

21:37.160 --> 21:43.480
and what we're like, let's say that 30% of people are pulling towards answer one and

21:43.480 --> 21:46.360
70% of people are pulling towards answer two.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.720
And let's say I'm pulling towards answer three.

21:48.720 --> 21:55.040
So as the swarm is evolving, the puck is moving towards answer two because most people are

21:55.040 --> 21:57.040
pulling towards that outcome.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.600
But if I really don't like answer two, I could oppose it.

21:59.600 --> 22:03.280
I could pull against it rather than pulling four or something, right?

22:03.280 --> 22:05.720
Or I could switch to answer one.

22:05.720 --> 22:10.160
Really what I'm, what I'm engaging in is this behavior that is really, really complex.

22:10.160 --> 22:15.960
It's like a game in which I'm deciding how do I want to try to influence the swarm?

22:15.960 --> 22:20.440
And so concretely, this could be if we're talking about a puck moving around a decision

22:20.440 --> 22:25.760
space on a screen, I could just be pulling directly against an answer that I don't want.

22:25.760 --> 22:30.080
Or I could be switching and pulling four and answer I do want.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.640
In real time, everyone's making these decisions.

22:32.640 --> 22:35.720
Everyone's thinking together and behaving together.

22:35.720 --> 22:43.920
And so it's, it forms a very complex system where there are an infinite number of ways to

22:43.920 --> 22:44.920
reach an answer.

22:44.920 --> 22:50.160
But the way that I behave is going to be reflective of my beliefs on that question.

22:50.160 --> 22:54.240
If I am pulling against an answer, I'm showing I really don't want that answer.

22:54.240 --> 22:58.680
If I'm pulling, if I switch from one answer to another, I'm saying, well, I value this

22:58.680 --> 22:59.680
answer.

22:59.680 --> 23:05.680
But if forced to choose a different answer, I would choose this one, this other answer.

23:05.680 --> 23:11.960
So yeah, I think you're on the spot on that it is really like a decision space where

23:11.960 --> 23:19.120
people are trying to come to come to an answer that's not necessarily their first choice.

23:19.120 --> 23:22.120
We're talking because there's AI involved in this.

23:22.120 --> 23:32.560
Let's maybe dig into where exactly you're using AI and what types of AI are at play here.

23:32.560 --> 23:39.680
So our research and AI focus mainly on three components, right?

23:39.680 --> 23:43.040
We are studying what happens before a swarm.

23:43.040 --> 23:46.040
How do we select the right participants to join a swarm?

23:46.040 --> 23:49.600
So a swarm of experts, we like can really only amplify intelligence.

23:49.600 --> 23:53.440
And so if people are flipping coins and they have no idea, we can't amplify that.

23:53.440 --> 23:59.800
So we have to find experts, people who know enough about a question, experts are enthusiasts

23:59.800 --> 24:01.280
in order to amplify intelligence.

24:01.280 --> 24:05.640
So finding the right people is really important and finding enough of them is really important.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.880
Swarms are more accurate with more people.

24:08.880 --> 24:12.880
So that's the first stage, finding the right people for a swarm.

24:12.880 --> 24:19.440
Then our AI system in the during the swarm phase is really really important.

24:19.440 --> 24:23.800
This is the phase where we're waiting people's contributions to the swarm when they're

24:23.800 --> 24:29.080
swarming, really engaging in deliberation and devising the algorithms that constitute

24:29.080 --> 24:30.080
that deliberation.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.840
So that's like, who has the most conviction?

24:32.840 --> 24:38.200
What is the right way to ask questions in order to get really accurate intelligence out?

24:38.200 --> 24:43.160
So that's a level of real time AI that we've devised and we continue to iterate upon

24:43.160 --> 24:45.400
and make more and more accurate.

24:45.400 --> 24:51.200
And then the final stage that we focus on researching is post processing.

24:51.200 --> 24:56.480
And so post processing can take any number of forms from visualization of the deliberation.

24:56.480 --> 25:04.000
Why did the swarm choose this? How did they reach this answer to more complex machine learning?

25:04.000 --> 25:08.920
Which is, what is the probability that the answer is correct?

25:08.920 --> 25:13.480
One of the really interesting projects that we did over the past couple months was training

25:13.480 --> 25:14.960
a conviction network.

25:14.960 --> 25:20.000
So this is a behavioral neural network that looks at the aggregate behaviors of all of these

25:20.000 --> 25:26.360
individuals in the swarm and tries to say, what is the probability in abstract terms

25:26.360 --> 25:29.040
that the swarm was correct?

25:29.040 --> 25:32.520
So to make this more concrete, let's take an example.

25:32.520 --> 25:36.200
Let's say we're predicting hockey and HL.

25:36.200 --> 25:40.120
And the swarm is considering will team A or team B win, right?

25:40.120 --> 25:47.200
So as the swarm behaves, you'll see people pulling for team A high confidence, team

25:47.200 --> 25:52.640
A low confidence, they're really expressing different levels of conviction in the right

25:52.640 --> 25:53.640
answer.

25:53.640 --> 25:58.920
We've trained a machine learning algorithm to predict the probability that that pick will

25:58.920 --> 25:59.920
be correct.

25:59.920 --> 26:04.680
So if they choose the nights to win a game, we may be able to say, not only, oh, we think

26:04.680 --> 26:09.360
the nights will win, but they'll win with a 64% probability.

26:09.360 --> 26:13.400
Now that's really, really interesting because it's a level deeper, it's a level more

26:13.400 --> 26:15.800
precise than what the swarm is giving.

26:15.800 --> 26:21.840
We're really using these complex behaviors, the acquiescence, the entrenchment of users

26:21.840 --> 26:28.320
to get an understanding of what is the real world probability of this event.

26:28.320 --> 26:34.200
And so with this model, with this probabilistic forecast, which we call conviction, we're

26:34.200 --> 26:38.720
able to significantly amplify the precision of swarms.

26:38.720 --> 26:42.640
One specific example of that was NBA last year.

26:42.640 --> 26:48.880
So we predicted 238 games over 25 weeks in NBA.

26:48.880 --> 26:51.720
So team A or team B, who will win.

26:51.720 --> 26:55.920
And we find that as a baseline, the swarm returns to 25% ROI.

26:55.920 --> 27:01.880
So betting on the swarm's picks, you would have made 25% of return on investment.

27:01.880 --> 27:06.040
That means if you bet $100 at the start of the season, and bet evenly across all of

27:06.040 --> 27:12.000
the swarm's picks, by the end of the season, you would have $125.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.840
Which is pretty impressive result, and we find statistically significant result that the

27:16.840 --> 27:21.080
swarm outperformed the large-scale Vegas application.

27:21.080 --> 27:26.600
But when we apply this machine learning model conviction to select the games that we

27:26.600 --> 27:32.160
think are more probable than Vegas suggests, like when we really devise it precise forecast

27:32.160 --> 27:39.280
and then bet based on that forecast, we can increase this ROI significantly to 52%.

27:39.280 --> 27:45.800
So really, that's a very, very interesting result to us because it means that the behaviors

27:45.800 --> 27:52.920
in swarms are more interesting and more important than just the raw result itself.

27:52.920 --> 27:57.160
It's how people interact with one another, how they weigh their levels of conviction, and

27:57.160 --> 28:03.520
how they behave that is the primary functionality of the swarm.

28:03.520 --> 28:08.200
It's why that's the reason this is so accurate.

28:08.200 --> 28:13.040
It sounds a little bit like kind of the mythical perpetual money machine.

28:13.040 --> 28:17.360
And whenever I hear that, I wonder, why are you bothering trying to sell software, or

28:17.360 --> 28:21.600
whatever you're doing, and that's just like playing your own bank?

28:21.600 --> 28:23.840
Yeah, absolutely.

28:23.840 --> 28:27.800
It's partly because this is a really experimental technology.

28:27.800 --> 28:29.400
This is also a very recent result.

28:29.400 --> 28:32.480
We published this conviction result recently.

28:32.480 --> 28:39.680
And so we're just starting to, we are always surprised by the accuracy of this technology.

28:39.680 --> 28:44.720
And so it is a, we're still growing our levels of confidence in this.

28:44.720 --> 28:48.920
Really, we're still experimenting and analyzing post-humorously these results.

28:48.920 --> 28:53.920
Sports forecasting and financial forecasting is definitely on our roadmap for the future.

28:53.920 --> 28:58.480
But we're a small team, and it's going to take a little bit more time before we're ready

28:58.480 --> 29:00.760
to put company money on that.

29:00.760 --> 29:06.440
Although I can share that our internal team is betting small amounts with our own money

29:06.440 --> 29:09.160
just as an office pool.

29:09.160 --> 29:10.960
Like just for fun.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.880
But before we're like, we're not ready to go.

29:12.880 --> 29:15.120
Kind of the unanimous version of dog fooding.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.600
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

29:16.600 --> 29:20.400
Puppy Chow is something we engage in regularly.

29:20.400 --> 29:29.040
So this conviction network, maybe talk a little bit about the inputs of this network,

29:29.040 --> 29:34.880
the architecture or structure of the network, anything unique about how it's trained, that

29:34.880 --> 29:35.880
kind of stuff.

29:35.880 --> 29:42.040
Yeah, so really it's a neural network that's training on the behaviors of swarms.

29:42.040 --> 29:47.160
So what I mean by that is it's looking at aggregate statistics, like how long a swarm

29:47.160 --> 29:53.200
took to reach an answer, how much support there was for each answer, and the changes in

29:53.200 --> 29:55.520
that support over time.

29:55.520 --> 30:02.160
And it uses these features, this set of features, and trains on the outcome of the games.

30:02.160 --> 30:07.680
So if the swarm reaches an answer very quickly with high support for a single team, that's

30:07.680 --> 30:12.320
a very high conviction answer and it's going to give a high probability that the swarm gets

30:12.320 --> 30:13.320
that answer correct.

30:13.320 --> 30:18.080
And historically, we've seen that high support for an answer and short time to reach that

30:18.080 --> 30:21.840
answer is associated with a very accurate forecast.

30:21.840 --> 30:29.720
So it's a standard machine learning program, like inputs as behaviors, outputs as probability

30:29.720 --> 30:34.080
trained on a binary representation of, was this game correct?

30:34.080 --> 30:35.080
It was a loss.

30:35.080 --> 30:42.680
Yeah, it went to losses, exactly, with the special sauce really being the behaviors of individuals

30:42.680 --> 30:43.680
in the swarm, right?

30:43.680 --> 30:49.200
The special component of this is the data that we have access to as part of treating

30:49.200 --> 30:53.280
humans as data processors rather than data points.

30:53.280 --> 30:57.560
So the inputs are essentially kind of meta features of the swarm itself.

30:57.560 --> 31:01.000
Yep, exactly.

31:01.000 --> 31:06.400
And so we're kind of digging into the various places that machine learning expresses itself

31:06.400 --> 31:14.000
in the platform, the conviction network, you kind of went through these three finding

31:14.000 --> 31:18.160
the right people waiting for their contributions and post processing and then it sounds like

31:18.160 --> 31:24.000
the conviction network is a separate thing if I'm understanding that correctly.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
Yeah.

31:25.000 --> 31:29.800
Maybe let's kind of dig into a little bit the, you know, those first three finding the

31:29.800 --> 31:32.760
right people like, where does machine learning come in there?

31:32.760 --> 31:34.600
Well, we can start there.

31:34.600 --> 31:35.600
Sure.

31:35.600 --> 31:36.600
Yeah.

31:36.600 --> 31:42.600
So conviction is like a one part of the post processing in the pre-processing section.

31:42.600 --> 31:49.240
We want actually my first project with unanimous was as like a master's project in my program

31:49.240 --> 31:52.760
was to identify the right users, right?

31:52.760 --> 31:57.920
So let's, we get a number of surveys every week, every, every week before our sports

31:57.920 --> 31:58.920
warms.

31:58.920 --> 32:02.840
We do a survey and we say, who do you think will win, team A or team B for each of the

32:02.840 --> 32:04.520
games that we're predicting?

32:04.520 --> 32:09.640
Obviously, over time, we find that some users are better than others.

32:09.640 --> 32:15.640
And so part of our statistics and machine learning efforts focus on how do we identify

32:15.640 --> 32:20.160
the right like users that will perform well?

32:20.160 --> 32:23.400
One way to do that is by saying, okay, what's your historical accuracy?

32:23.400 --> 32:28.400
And we can use a Bayesian framework for that or we can use like other statistical frameworks

32:28.400 --> 32:31.120
to say, what is your average accuracy over time?

32:31.120 --> 32:32.960
And we can use those users?

32:32.960 --> 32:38.360
Or we could look a little deeper into the data that we're collecting and say for a specific

32:38.360 --> 32:43.480
survey, what is the probability that you are like a good user?

32:43.480 --> 32:48.480
How, how well are you expected to perform relative to average?

32:48.480 --> 32:53.480
We've made some really interesting strides in that space as well by treating humans as like

32:53.480 --> 32:59.160
again, as data processors rather than data points.

32:59.160 --> 33:04.000
And so like to give an example of one of the ways we're doing that, we designed recently

33:04.000 --> 33:11.880
a dynamic survey that uses a novel nonlinear scale to make humans really think about to

33:11.880 --> 33:20.600
weigh their risk and reward, to say they are essentially wagering on games, but the more

33:20.600 --> 33:27.320
that they wager on one team, the amount that they win if the other team is actually wins

33:27.320 --> 33:30.280
and is successful decreases even more.

33:30.280 --> 33:36.760
And so there's this nonlinear dichotomy that they have to think about and be faced with

33:36.760 --> 33:38.560
in order to make a decision.

33:38.560 --> 33:45.600
And so we found that this method of wagering, which if you go on our blog and take one of

33:45.600 --> 33:50.680
these sports predictions, you actually be directed to this novel scale, we found that

33:50.680 --> 33:57.920
this method of asking people to behave in a survey allows us to identify the good versus

33:57.920 --> 34:01.440
the bad performers on a specific week more accurately.

34:01.440 --> 34:06.640
So more than just saying, oh, you've performed well in the past, we have methods that allow

34:06.640 --> 34:12.800
us to identify, oh, on the specific week, are you likely to perform well?

34:12.800 --> 34:17.040
You know, say going back to kind of our predicting sports games, it strikes me that one of

34:17.040 --> 34:22.880
the keys would be figuring out the right representation or features for the games themselves.

34:22.880 --> 34:30.400
Like, how do you, what makes a given, you know, we talking about even the right people

34:30.400 --> 34:35.080
for hockey versus basketball, and I guess, you know, we can just label those as hockey

34:35.080 --> 34:40.040
and basketball, but if we're talking about a specific basketball game, are we, you

34:40.040 --> 34:41.560
know, is it kind of a naive thing?

34:41.560 --> 34:47.160
Well, this person, you know, bets correctly with regards to this team or, you know, I

34:47.160 --> 34:54.480
guess how rich is the feature space for that you're looking at for games or, you know,

34:54.480 --> 34:58.240
any of these things that you're trying to optimize the people choices around?

34:58.240 --> 34:59.240
Yeah, absolutely.

34:59.240 --> 35:00.840
That's a great question.

35:00.840 --> 35:05.960
So the data set is getting richer as we clutch more data.

35:05.960 --> 35:13.320
What I think you're moving towards is, can we wait the contributions of individuals for

35:13.320 --> 35:14.440
specific games?

35:14.440 --> 35:21.120
So if we notice that one of, like, this one user, let's call them user A, is great at predicting

35:21.120 --> 35:27.400
the outcome of night's games, maybe because there are nights fan, but really terrible at predicting

35:27.400 --> 35:31.800
Raptor games or, like, so those are two hockey teams.

35:31.800 --> 35:35.760
So they're great at predicting one hockey team, but really bad at predicting another hockey

35:35.760 --> 35:39.240
team, like, because they're fans of one team and maybe don't know anything about the other

35:39.240 --> 35:41.800
team.

35:41.800 --> 35:47.920
It's like, so could we wait that user in this form, highly on one question, give that sort

35:47.920 --> 35:53.480
of an expert level on one question and give them a novice level on another question, which

35:53.480 --> 36:04.480
is sort of yes we can, but we find that generally, we want to, we want to curate a diverse population

36:04.480 --> 36:07.960
so in order to make the most accurate predictions.

36:07.960 --> 36:13.920
And so the factors that I would highlight as being the most key to accurate swarm forecasting

36:13.920 --> 36:20.480
are the average level of knowledge of participants, the average, the size of the group as the two

36:20.480 --> 36:24.240
primary factors, and then the third is the diversity of beliefs.

36:24.240 --> 36:29.240
So the more, or the diversity of information sources, and what I would say about that

36:29.240 --> 36:35.640
is if everyone is answering questions from the same news source, so if everyone's getting

36:35.640 --> 36:40.640
their news from Fox News or something and there's no diversity, no one's getting from CNN

36:40.640 --> 36:46.040
or BBC or LG Zero, then they're all going to have the same belief and they may all be

36:46.040 --> 36:47.920
right or they may all be wrong.

36:47.920 --> 36:53.040
What swarms are really good at is aggregating from really diverse information sets, really

36:53.040 --> 36:54.120
diverse sources.

36:54.120 --> 37:00.840
And so if we have one night's fan and one raptors fan, that's probably going to be better

37:00.840 --> 37:06.920
than just having all really accurate night's fans in a group.

37:06.920 --> 37:12.600
So we've talked about post processing and pre processing, what are, what are kind of

37:12.600 --> 37:16.320
the underlying mechanisms of the waiting component?

37:16.320 --> 37:23.320
So the most important, so in during the swarm and the optimization of the swarm, which

37:23.320 --> 37:31.080
is the central component to our technology, the most important thing are these algorithms

37:31.080 --> 37:39.160
that we've discussed around how do we allow groups to deliberate, how do we engage them

37:39.160 --> 37:45.560
in a real time system, so the real time component of this algorithm is really the most important,

37:45.560 --> 37:51.240
but then second to that is how do we allow them to see each other's beliefs and how do

37:51.240 --> 37:52.880
we aggregate those beliefs?

37:52.880 --> 38:00.080
And so those are really systems level components that I think are the most important.

38:00.080 --> 38:06.640
And so is machine learning a component in doing those system level things or are they

38:06.640 --> 38:10.240
more deterministic in some way or?

38:10.240 --> 38:14.760
Yeah, so we use machine learning to understand what makes an accurate swarm.

38:14.760 --> 38:19.920
We use data science to do that as well as we are developed and as we become more complex

38:19.920 --> 38:25.720
as a company, we may be able to use machine learning within the algorithm itself.

38:25.720 --> 38:31.440
At the moment, what we've has gotten us to this point though has been just allowing,

38:31.440 --> 38:32.960
just having static algorithms.

38:32.960 --> 38:39.200
So algorithms that there's a list of I think 30 algorithms that determine how the swarm

38:39.200 --> 38:46.640
evolves determines the weight of individuals that determines the location of the puck,

38:46.640 --> 38:50.280
all of these different factors, and while we use data science and machine learning to

38:50.280 --> 38:57.600
optimize those factors, we don't use machine learning in the process of a swarm.

38:57.600 --> 39:05.840
And so we've talked about kind of sports betting as one area of use for this, you're building

39:05.840 --> 39:10.800
this for some customer, maybe you're building it ultimately to build a perpetual money

39:10.800 --> 39:15.960
machine and just get rich with compounding winnings.

39:15.960 --> 39:20.640
But perhaps is there a customer that you've got in mind for this?

39:20.640 --> 39:23.960
And if so, who is that customer?

39:23.960 --> 39:28.240
Is it the sports world or is that kind of a demonstration?

39:28.240 --> 39:33.120
Is there some other kind of customer who do you think needs this?

39:33.120 --> 39:38.840
Yeah, so I think it was Einstein that said compounding interest is the most powerful force

39:38.840 --> 39:42.040
in the universe, but that's not really our goal here.

39:42.040 --> 39:45.040
Our goal is to make humans smarter.

39:45.040 --> 39:53.360
It's to keep humans relevant in a time where AI is becoming very dominant or very powerful.

39:53.360 --> 39:57.520
This system follows by being based off of humans.

39:57.520 --> 40:03.000
It has human ethics, human morals, and it's able to make decisions that AI, I don't

40:03.000 --> 40:08.040
believe should, because it keeps humans in the loop.

40:08.040 --> 40:14.640
As a result of that, what we're really targeting with this platform is allowing human teams

40:14.640 --> 40:15.960
to access this tool.

40:15.960 --> 40:20.960
And so one of the exciting news and outs we have is that in the next two weeks we'll

40:20.960 --> 40:25.720
be opening this system up, this platform up for beta customers.

40:25.720 --> 40:31.680
So any business team that wants to amplify their accuracy of their forecasts or prioritizations

40:31.680 --> 40:36.760
or get consumer research in a more accurate way to understand that beliefs and needs

40:36.760 --> 40:43.880
of their consumers, all of these applications can be used by subscribers to this software.

40:43.880 --> 40:48.800
So really what we're focusing on is making humans smarter and having as broad a reach

40:48.800 --> 40:54.920
in terms of the teams and the applications that we can help people make good decisions

40:54.920 --> 40:56.560
with as possible.

40:56.560 --> 41:03.920
A link to that, the artificial swarm intelligence paper in the show notes and that one has a

41:03.920 --> 41:13.240
ton of references by yourself and Lewis in a variety of kind of peer reviewed conferences

41:13.240 --> 41:18.640
and journals and the like for folks that want to dig in deeper.

41:18.640 --> 41:23.360
But if you were to, is there any other kind of singular reference that you would point

41:23.360 --> 41:28.760
folks to who want to learn more about this way of kind of building systems or thinking

41:28.760 --> 41:29.760
about systems?

41:29.760 --> 41:35.000
Yeah, I think the white paper is the best resource for just understanding.

41:35.000 --> 41:40.640
And other than that, I would refer you to our website, unanimous.ai or our publications

41:40.640 --> 41:45.360
page, unanimous.ai slash publications, those both are great resources for understanding

41:45.360 --> 41:51.440
how this works, the applications for where this can be applied and sort of why it works.

41:51.440 --> 41:52.440
Awesome.

41:52.440 --> 41:53.440
So great.

41:53.440 --> 41:57.440
