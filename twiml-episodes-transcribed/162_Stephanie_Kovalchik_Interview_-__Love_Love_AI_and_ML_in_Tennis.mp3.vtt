Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast why interview interesting

00:16.320 --> 00:21.480
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

00:21.480 --> 00:31.680
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

00:31.680 --> 00:37.040
In this the final episode of our AI and sports series, I'm joined by Stephanie Kovalczyk,

00:37.040 --> 00:43.360
Research Fellow at Victoria University and Senior Sports Scientist at Tennis Australia.

00:43.360 --> 00:47.440
Stephanie and I had a great conversation about a few of the many interesting projects

00:47.440 --> 00:49.360
underway at Tennis Australia.

00:49.360 --> 00:53.840
We start out taking a look at their use of data to develop a player rating system based

00:53.840 --> 00:58.400
on ability and probability as opposed to the current official one which is based on

00:58.400 --> 01:01.280
points scored and match results.

01:01.280 --> 01:06.360
We then get into some of the interesting products her game insight group is developing, including

01:06.360 --> 01:11.480
a win forecasting algorithm and a statistic that measures a given player's workload during

01:11.480 --> 01:13.120
a match.

01:13.120 --> 01:18.560
Stephanie details her paper, is there a Pythagorean theorem for winning in tennis which

01:18.560 --> 01:24.200
explores the development and application of a Pythagorean theorem for win expectation

01:24.200 --> 01:25.720
in tennis.

01:25.720 --> 01:30.440
We also take a look at her project to develop a system for classifying ending shots and

01:30.440 --> 01:34.840
an emotion tracking system that helps show the link between emotion and performance in

01:34.840 --> 01:35.840
tennis.

01:35.840 --> 01:38.520
All right, on to the show.

01:38.520 --> 01:42.440
All right everyone, I am on the line with Stephanie Kovalczyk.

01:42.440 --> 01:48.320
Stephanie is a Research Fellow at Victoria University and Senior Sports Scientist at Tennis

01:48.320 --> 01:49.320
Australia.

01:49.320 --> 01:52.000
Stephanie, welcome to this weekend machine learning and AI.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.200
Hi Sam, thanks for happy me.

01:54.200 --> 01:55.200
Absolutely.

01:55.200 --> 01:59.200
Why don't we get started by talking a little bit about your background.

01:59.200 --> 02:04.080
You've got a background in statistics, but you're applying that to the field of tennis

02:04.080 --> 02:05.080
now.

02:05.080 --> 02:06.080
How did that come about?

02:06.080 --> 02:08.240
Yeah, it's kind of an interesting one.

02:08.240 --> 02:16.120
I guess to go way back, I was always really interested in science and so I knew definitely

02:16.120 --> 02:23.040
that I wanted a career in science, but I actually started out kind of more interested in neuroscience

02:23.040 --> 02:24.040
when I was an undergrad.

02:24.040 --> 02:30.400
I was looking into biology and really thought the brain and how it worked was fascinating.

02:30.400 --> 02:33.960
So I kind of thought I was going to do that.

02:33.960 --> 02:42.720
I was at Caltech and then I spent a year after graduating, just doing pure research and

02:42.720 --> 02:48.880
I was collecting data and starting to analyze it and it was at that point that I realized

02:48.880 --> 02:55.960
how important stats were to science and reaching conclusions and I really just wanted

02:55.960 --> 02:57.680
to do that all of the time.

02:57.680 --> 03:06.440
So then I looked to see what programs I might go into and I found a great one at UCL

03:06.440 --> 03:15.720
today, so I went over there and finished my master's in PhD there and I was actually in

03:15.720 --> 03:16.720
bio-stat.

03:16.720 --> 03:23.520
So I was very applied a lot of focus on applications and statistics to health and things like clinical

03:23.520 --> 03:32.920
trial design and studying diseases and after that I went to the National Cancer Institute

03:32.920 --> 03:38.440
actually did a fellowship there and it was all focused on risk prediction, but that was

03:38.440 --> 03:45.200
kind of my first place where I got it, I retased a real model building and with an important

03:45.200 --> 03:51.440
practical outcome where our whole goal was to try to help doctors and patients better

03:51.440 --> 03:57.440
assess their risk for different types of cancer and learned a lot just about the different

03:57.440 --> 04:04.400
approaches, particularly more from kind of the epidemiological point of view.

04:04.400 --> 04:08.640
So so far you're probably wondering where is the sports angle in all of this.

04:08.640 --> 04:17.640
I was on a very kind of health statistician track and on the side, it's a classic story

04:17.640 --> 04:24.720
in sports statistics where it's like the hobbyist goes home and spends all of their evenings

04:24.720 --> 04:33.840
just scraping data and calculating percentages and that's that's literally what happened.

04:33.840 --> 04:39.040
I mean more after grad school once I kind of had enough of a foundation and I was always

04:39.040 --> 04:44.960
watching time as I just loved love the sport my whole life and and I was starting to watch

04:44.960 --> 04:51.840
it from that that perspective and you know at that point like the whole money ball era

04:51.840 --> 04:58.600
in sport was like well underway but it never had really reached tennis and I was just confused

04:58.600 --> 05:04.040
why you know why weren't we seeing that same kind of advance and I started looking on

05:04.040 --> 05:07.800
the web to see what kind of data was available in the sport and there was actually quite a

05:07.800 --> 05:12.840
lot at least when you're thinking of the kinds of data you might want for like building

05:12.840 --> 05:19.320
a rating system for for players for example you could do that for all of the you know

05:19.320 --> 05:27.080
the open era history in tennis just from publicly available data so so I started to take

05:27.080 --> 05:32.120
on like kind of small projects but it grew over time and then I was starting to present

05:32.120 --> 05:37.680
at sports conferences and eventually that was how I learned about the role at tennis

05:37.680 --> 05:47.160
Australia meeting another sports sports scientist that was working working there and that

05:47.160 --> 05:54.840
was the first time that I realized that somebody could work full time on sports doing statistics

05:54.840 --> 06:01.080
I figured you had to be doing it in baseball or basketball I yeah I just wasn't even

06:01.080 --> 06:06.360
really pursuing that as a career I just thought it would always be this passion the side

06:06.360 --> 06:12.680
passion yeah so luckily I turned out that I just didn't realize the opportunities and

06:12.680 --> 06:18.680
kind of stumbled on one and I've been in in that role for two and a half years now and

06:19.400 --> 06:26.520
yeah it's really a dream situation that's fantastic did you play competitively growing

06:26.520 --> 06:31.960
up or in college or something like that in high school I mean that that was about the extent

06:31.960 --> 06:38.280
of my ability but it was one of those things where like first sport that I really learned with

06:38.280 --> 06:43.640
my dad and you know so it kind of had a special place and and there's something appealing just

06:43.640 --> 06:49.720
about the individual nature of it you know you're you're out there and you're totally alone I mean

06:49.720 --> 06:54.200
there's nobody that's going to help you with any of the decision-making and and so I think that

06:54.200 --> 06:59.960
really lends itself to kind of you know and interesting drama and stories that that make

07:00.680 --> 07:06.200
you know the whole journey of individual players that much more interesting you mentioned using

07:06.200 --> 07:13.960
open data to come up with a rating system now as I understand it tennis has a well-established

07:13.960 --> 07:21.080
formal rating system what would be the relationship between that type of the formal system and one

07:21.080 --> 07:28.120
that you'd come up with with openly available data yeah so tennis does have official rankings

07:28.120 --> 07:37.640
and those are based on a point-based method where players basically rack up points based on

07:37.640 --> 07:43.880
their performance at individual tournaments and the bigger the tournament the more points they get

07:43.880 --> 07:49.720
and the deeper that they go in that event the more points that they get but it's not actually tied

07:49.720 --> 07:57.080
in any statistical way to the expectations about what they should be doing and how difficult

07:57.080 --> 08:05.160
their opponent is so one one thing that statisticians working in tennis have been interested in

08:05.160 --> 08:13.640
is whether if you have an approach that is based sort of on the probabilities around individual

08:13.640 --> 08:19.800
match results if that would give you a better assessment of a player's overall ability because

08:19.800 --> 08:25.640
it's directly tied to what they're expected to do and how they're actually performing so as an

08:25.640 --> 08:32.520
example an alternative to the official rankings would be an ELO based system and that would be an

08:32.520 --> 08:40.360
example of one that's a probability based way of measuring player ability it can also be applied

08:40.360 --> 08:47.560
to teams and in fact is used by a number of of professional teams it was actually developed

08:47.560 --> 08:53.400
originally for chess for rating chess players but that's a system that's really it's really

08:53.400 --> 09:03.240
well established and and my group we have shown that it does outperform the official rankings

09:03.240 --> 09:10.200
just in terms of the assessment of player performance so if you use it to evaluate how a player's

09:10.200 --> 09:15.320
likely to perform in the future so use it as a basis for forecasting their future results

09:15.320 --> 09:21.800
it does a better job than than models based off of official rankings so yeah so that's

09:21.800 --> 09:28.840
one reason to to prefer it and you can also do fun stuff like look at surface specific versions

09:28.840 --> 09:34.280
you can try to focus more on player's services return which is kind of an offensive defense

09:34.280 --> 09:40.360
of type of breakdown so it's something that's there's stuff I think more more research questions

09:40.360 --> 09:47.320
around even improving the current systems that are used but all of those possible improvements

09:47.320 --> 09:55.400
can be done with with open data so Stephanie you work as a data scientist as part of the game

09:55.400 --> 10:03.000
insight group at tennis Australia what exactly does that group do and what's your day-to-day role

10:03.000 --> 10:11.080
as a data scientist there yeah um gig as we call it is sort of an academic industry partnership

10:11.080 --> 10:20.280
so that's my two hats doing research at Victoria University and then being part of this research

10:20.920 --> 10:26.360
group with tennis Australia so tennis Australia Victoria came together they realized that there

10:26.360 --> 10:35.240
was this real opportunity in tennis to advance what's being done with with data that's available

10:35.240 --> 10:41.880
and so the game insight group is really an initiative to try to take advantage of that that

10:41.880 --> 10:50.520
opportunity so it's it's a research and development group that's we include a number of of data

10:50.520 --> 10:56.360
scientists and we spend all of our time just focusing on questions of interest in how can we

10:56.360 --> 11:02.600
understand you know why some athletes in tennis do better than others I mean ultimately we're

11:02.600 --> 11:10.920
trying to kind of crack that question um and so we have a number of areas of research and then we

11:10.920 --> 11:15.960
get the chance to actually create products out of those as well so there's kind of a large

11:15.960 --> 11:21.480
translational component to what we do where we're trying to not only address questions that are

11:21.480 --> 11:28.440
of interest to us sort of as you know academics and researchers but that we think the results of

11:28.440 --> 11:36.440
pursuing that research could directly impact the sport and and have benefit back to how athletes

11:36.440 --> 11:45.320
are training how coaches are making decisions about their development um so that's one of the

11:45.320 --> 11:51.400
really exciting things about about the role is that translational piece and um yeah so we

11:51.400 --> 11:58.280
um are spending a lot of our time doing what you might typically think of with a researcher

11:58.280 --> 12:05.880
at at a university but then we also get the chance to participate with events try to bring stats

12:05.880 --> 12:13.400
to life in actual matches um for fans and then work with players and coaches to help them

12:14.120 --> 12:18.040
as they're you know trying to pursue their performance objectives

12:18.040 --> 12:24.920
what's an example of one of the products that you've been able to create in the role

12:25.720 --> 12:31.240
so we have a number of stats actually that we debuted this year at the Australian Open that's

12:31.240 --> 12:37.640
kind of our marquee event as you might imagine being at Melbourne Park and so that included a win

12:38.360 --> 12:47.640
forecasting approach which allowed us to let fans know what each player's chances were of

12:47.640 --> 12:52.760
winning the match at any point in time and to contrast that with where they were at the start so

12:52.760 --> 12:58.040
it kind of gives you an interesting idea about um the momentum over the course of a match

12:58.760 --> 13:05.960
we also had a work stat that we introduced which I was really excited about because tennis is a very

13:05.960 --> 13:12.120
physical game there's so much interest in how uh players how much effort they're making during

13:12.120 --> 13:18.520
matches and how that's affecting their performance but we don't actually have a lot of stats um

13:18.520 --> 13:26.840
around the physicality um of actual match play so we have worked on a work stat that basically

13:26.840 --> 13:34.040
gives you an comprehensive look at how much um physical effort players are making

13:34.040 --> 13:38.600
primarily in their lower body so by running around on changes of direction

13:38.600 --> 13:43.400
accelerations decelerations we take all of that into account to come up with this overall work

13:43.400 --> 13:49.480
measure and so that's another thing that's fun to look at um how different the two players in

13:49.480 --> 13:56.760
any particular matchup are as as a match progresses so every year yeah we are looking for new metrics

13:56.760 --> 14:04.040
that will give um kind of a new perspective to uh to the sport and those were some examples that

14:04.040 --> 14:08.520
we introduced this year that sounds really interesting can you talk a little bit more about that

14:08.520 --> 14:14.600
work set uh where does the data for example will come from so that's one that's based off of

14:14.600 --> 14:21.640
tracking data which has kind of been a new thing it's if you look just across sports more broadly

14:21.640 --> 14:28.680
tracking data is kind of the um the Holy Grail um for her sport statistician because it

14:28.680 --> 14:33.080
represents some of the highest quality information that's out there about performance

14:33.080 --> 14:41.640
um in tennis it became um more available with the introduction of the player challenge system

14:41.640 --> 14:47.720
which is a multi camera system that sits on courts and tracks the ball throughout a match

14:47.720 --> 14:54.040
and it allows players to be able to review line calls if they think there's been an error made

14:54.040 --> 15:00.120
they get to use a challenge and then there's sort of a video graphic representation of where

15:00.120 --> 15:05.960
that particular shot landed with respect to the lines for that to happen but yeah for that to

15:05.960 --> 15:11.960
happen there's all this data being generated about the um position of the ball and space at any

15:11.960 --> 15:19.800
point in time and it also has information about the player locations as well so uh gig we have um

15:19.800 --> 15:28.040
access to uh that tracking data for the Australian Open Series events um so for that that part of

15:28.040 --> 15:34.680
the calendar we get a comprehensive look at the physical characteristics of shots and player

15:34.680 --> 15:42.760
movement um and so that would represent all hardcore matches um and we have that going back

15:42.760 --> 15:49.320
to like 2012 so that's been a big area of development for us is like what what is size can we get

15:49.320 --> 15:58.440
out of those data that we can use um in our player services or in um enhancing the experience out

15:58.440 --> 16:06.840
events and thinking about that that data source multiple cameras different angles it strikes me

16:06.840 --> 16:12.680
that there are a ton of interesting machine learning and AI types of challenges in there to go

16:12.680 --> 16:19.400
from that to you know some kind of representation of a player position or even player foot positions

16:19.400 --> 16:26.200
that will allow you to get to things like acceleration and distance covered and all these things um

16:26.200 --> 16:32.040
is that processing of the the video to get to some of the positional information are you involved

16:32.040 --> 16:37.960
in that or is that done upstream to you and you get more refined information we're not actually

16:37.960 --> 16:43.480
collecting those data or producing those data ourselves that's done by the company that's

16:43.480 --> 16:49.640
responsible for um providing that challenge the player challenge system which is Hawkeye who's

16:49.640 --> 16:56.680
now part of Sony and they actually are that data provider for um other sports as well like they

16:56.680 --> 17:04.440
provide a video review system for cricket for example um so they're the they're the data provider

17:04.440 --> 17:13.240
and um what we end up getting from those are um summaries of the um it's effectively arcs

17:13.240 --> 17:20.840
of the movement of the ball so a typical shot will have two two arcs and those are described

17:20.840 --> 17:29.560
with uh polynomials polynomial functions in 3D space so you get a uh summary function um but

17:29.560 --> 17:35.640
it's at a very uh fine level of detail and from that you can derive a number of of interesting

17:35.640 --> 17:43.800
things like the ball speed at any point in time um it's height it's you know angular characteristics um

17:43.800 --> 17:48.120
so that's the data that we're provided so it's not exactly wrong the sense that you're not looking

17:48.120 --> 17:54.520
at like coordinates in space it's in a summary form but it's still quite um quite granular

17:54.520 --> 18:01.880
okay you mentioned earlier player acceleration and i'm trying to envision how you might derive

18:01.880 --> 18:07.720
that from ball positions can you elaborate on that yeah so for the players we actually have a

18:07.720 --> 18:14.280
2D coordinate of um the position of their stance so it's effectively in like the midpoint of

18:14.280 --> 18:23.160
their stance at any point in time um and that is tracked at like 25 hertz so you get 25 samples

18:23.160 --> 18:30.840
per second of um of their um x y position okay and so it's from that that we would derive

18:30.840 --> 18:36.760
anything around the player movement got it got it super interesting i i did have a question from

18:36.760 --> 18:43.560
your uh from looking at some of your publications on your website you one of your uh recent articles

18:43.560 --> 18:50.280
is is there a Pythagorean theorem for winning in tennis and uh in looking into that a little

18:50.280 --> 18:54.920
bit like i didn't realize that Pythagorean theorems and sports was a thing but it sounds like

18:54.920 --> 19:00.040
it's a whole it's a whole thing can you talk a little bit about the background and uh implications

19:00.040 --> 19:07.160
of all that yeah it's actually a fun one kind of historically in in sports stats because it was one

19:07.160 --> 19:15.480
of the um one of the things that Bill James who's kind of now become like this you know godfather

19:15.480 --> 19:22.200
of sports statistics one of the the things that um one of his major contributions to baseball

19:22.200 --> 19:27.560
statistics was the development of this Pythagorean theorem or sometimes you'll see it called the

19:27.560 --> 19:34.840
Pythagorean expectation so sports edificions spend a lot of their time thinking about how can they

19:34.840 --> 19:41.000
forecast outcomes in the sport because if you can do that usually means it gives you a better

19:41.000 --> 19:46.920
understanding of why some succeed and others don't and that's ultimately you know a central

19:46.920 --> 19:55.960
question to a lot of uh what we do um so the Pythagorean theorem is one approach to looking at

19:56.440 --> 20:02.520
i'm getting the spreadsheet thing again okay sorry that's okay i'm just i'm sorry i was trying

20:02.520 --> 20:08.440
to manage my dog down there and i think the mic moved around uh should i start uh back

20:08.440 --> 20:15.400
sure sure um so the Pythagorean theorem it's it's an interesting one historically because it was

20:15.400 --> 20:24.280
one of the major contributions of of Bill James who's become the sort of godfather of sports statistics

20:24.280 --> 20:32.040
and what he looked at was a question around you know how could you try to determine if a a team

20:32.040 --> 20:39.160
let's say is midway in their their season what they're likely um overall win percentage is going

20:39.160 --> 20:47.480
to be at the end of the season and so looking at that problem he he developed this Pythagorean

20:47.480 --> 20:56.280
expectation and what i was interested in is whether a similar idea um in a similar relationship

20:56.280 --> 21:05.400
existed in tennis so the main thought behind it is that um you know how do you get a win

21:05.400 --> 21:13.080
and in most sports it usually means earning more points in some sense than your opponent um so in

21:13.080 --> 21:20.040
baseball it's runs it's all about you know being ahead of your opponent and runs the Pythagorean

21:20.040 --> 21:27.480
expectation shows that actually if you look at the runs earned by a team over the course of a season

21:27.480 --> 21:33.560
against the runs that their opponents have earned against them and you take the square of those

21:33.560 --> 21:42.440
that that ratio between the teams runs earned squared against the sum of um that quantity and their

21:42.440 --> 21:50.840
opponents uh runs earned is actually quite accurate of setting expectations for what a team's

21:50.840 --> 21:57.000
overall win record is going to look like in the long term so that's where this the Pythagorean

21:57.000 --> 22:01.400
label comes from because if you look at these squared terms it looks a little bit like the

22:01.400 --> 22:08.760
relationship between the sides of a triangle so yeah so James was working at that like in the 80s

22:08.760 --> 22:15.800
which you know that's like ancient times from sports stats perspective um and since then a lot

22:15.800 --> 22:20.840
of other statisticians have looked to see if if similar relationships exist in their sport because

22:20.840 --> 22:25.240
you know we're most of us are all in that situation of like you're just trying to earn more points

22:25.240 --> 22:31.880
so maybe there's kind of a similar similar thing that you can find and there have been applications

22:31.880 --> 22:39.080
of it in basketball hockey and um and it holds up although the exponent the sort of optimal

22:39.080 --> 22:45.240
exponent um for setting those expectations varies from one sport to the next and it's kind of

22:45.240 --> 22:49.320
interesting because if you look at that exponent depending on what value it takes it kind of tells

22:49.320 --> 22:54.840
you how important one additional point whatever that point represents for that particular sport

22:54.840 --> 23:00.280
it tells you how important that is um in that particular sport so if you're in a very high

23:00.280 --> 23:08.040
scoring type of sport like basketball um one additional point um will generally mean less than

23:08.040 --> 23:14.280
an additional run in baseball for example so back to tennis in tennis it's kind of interesting

23:14.280 --> 23:21.400
because it's a higher article type of game right there's you have points within games and games

23:21.400 --> 23:27.640
within sets and you don't necessarily have to win every point to win the match in fact there's a

23:27.640 --> 23:33.880
special name for matches where the winner actually won a lower percentage of points are called kind

23:33.880 --> 23:40.840
of like the lottery matches because it's just um seems a little bit like they kind of kind of

23:40.840 --> 23:48.040
involved yeah a bit um a bit of chance or or luck on that it's rare it happens maybe five

23:48.040 --> 23:53.480
percent of the time but still it points out the fact that the nature of points in tennis

23:53.480 --> 23:58.520
are a different thing than in a lot of other sports where you're basically there's an incentive

23:58.520 --> 24:06.440
to win every single point um so it kind of makes you think well maybe this would be one of the sports

24:06.440 --> 24:12.280
where this just this expectation this theorem breaks down um but it turns out that if you focus

24:12.280 --> 24:21.640
on break points now these are situations where a receiver um has an opportunity to win a game

24:21.640 --> 24:29.560
and that's a special situation in tennis because there is a strong serve advantage just the nature

24:29.560 --> 24:35.400
of the serve usually gives the player that serving an edge for winning those points and so more

24:35.400 --> 24:42.120
often than not players win their service games when they're serving um and anytime that doesn't

24:42.120 --> 24:48.600
happen it's a real opportunity for the other player to take an advantage a position of advantage

24:48.600 --> 24:55.320
and in fact most matches are one based off of uh breaks of serve um the only instance where that

24:55.320 --> 25:01.960
isn't the case is when um uh set has to go to a tie break um but by and large matches are

25:01.960 --> 25:07.960
decided on the basis of the small subset of these break point opportunities and if you focus on that

25:07.960 --> 25:13.080
and that basically becomes your let's say break point uh break points one becomes your points

25:13.080 --> 25:19.160
under this Pythagorean model that that you can find a strong relationship between that and a player's

25:19.160 --> 25:27.720
overall uh match win expectations over the uh over a period of time and not only that but it turns

25:27.720 --> 25:33.720
out the exponent is very similar to the one found in baseball um which kind of makes sense because

25:33.720 --> 25:38.920
if you look at the number of break points that are typically involving particular match it's kind

25:38.920 --> 25:46.920
of a similar scale or range as runs in baseball okay so yeah interesting interesting and the

25:47.720 --> 25:55.560
method for demonstrating this is this um you know is it like uh coming up with the theory and then

25:55.560 --> 26:03.480
backtesting it to a bunch of data or how did you arrive at at the the notion of using the break point

26:03.480 --> 26:10.360
well it's interesting you can actually represent that Pythagorean relationship even with a general

26:10.360 --> 26:17.560
form with let's say um the exponent being an unknown parameter you can express that and as a

26:17.560 --> 26:25.160
linear model so it actually has um a form you can then investigate the simplest form where you're

26:25.160 --> 26:32.280
just looking at let's say one uh run type or point type and and then the goal is just trying to

26:32.280 --> 26:39.320
find what is the best um exponent that can all be done within a linear regression framework so

26:39.320 --> 26:48.280
very kind of simple just to do um a basic um application of the model um the the thing that's

26:48.280 --> 26:52.440
more of a question is what time periods are you looking at and like what is the period over which

26:52.440 --> 26:58.760
you're forecasting and that's really you want to maybe consider how it might be used so

26:58.760 --> 27:06.520
in tennis um you might expect that maybe after a few months into a season there being interesting

27:06.520 --> 27:12.120
projecting where that player's likely to be the end of the season um and so on obviously if you're

27:12.120 --> 27:17.960
a month out from you know your your your last few events of the season it doing that kind of

27:17.960 --> 27:24.440
projection might be less relevant so so we looked at sort of six month projecting six months out

27:24.440 --> 27:31.240
you know 12 months out um and set up the training data for for that purpose um but that's

27:31.240 --> 27:37.400
you know that's all almost like tuning parameters in terms of how you're going going around to evaluate

27:37.400 --> 27:45.080
the approach um but that that basic form um fits within you know our kind of basic regression

27:45.080 --> 27:50.280
framework so what are some other ways that you've applied machine learning to this type of work?

27:50.280 --> 27:57.880
well a few interesting things that were we're working on now one was actually started as um a

27:57.880 --> 28:03.640
hackathon during this year as a starting open which was nice because it was sort of in parallel

28:03.640 --> 28:09.880
we had um you know our one of the majors um underway the first major of the year and then we had

28:09.880 --> 28:17.880
this big data science competition so um it's awesome yeah so that um at the end we enter that

28:17.880 --> 28:25.560
having um thousands of data scientists participated and the goal of the the project was to use the

28:25.560 --> 28:33.720
tracking data we were talking about to um classify the ending shot so in tennis there's a lot of

28:33.720 --> 28:41.320
interest about how the how a point ends in terms of um was it a winner uh unforced error or forced

28:41.320 --> 28:47.640
error so those are kind of the three mutually exclusive categories that any shot um that ends

28:47.640 --> 28:56.520
a point can fall into and ebma is but today that labeling it's done at professional events but

28:56.520 --> 29:01.160
it's still done by a human that's sitting on court and actually entering those labels with every

29:01.160 --> 29:09.000
point and um as you can imagine i mean that's it's labor intensive and probably not um the best job

29:09.000 --> 29:14.360
although if you're a tennis fan i guess you wouldn't mind getting this it down there um but one

29:14.360 --> 29:20.280
issue is actually consistency with those labels so if you look at some of the unforced

29:20.280 --> 29:26.760
error winner stats from event to event they can look quite different and there was actually

29:26.760 --> 29:33.720
a notice at a recent Davis Cup event um sort of the form tennis forms went a little bit crazy

29:33.720 --> 29:40.280
because there were clearly some problems and how um those stats were being tallied so you'd like

29:40.280 --> 29:46.760
to be able to you know have a more efficient approach and also um one that's more reliable from

29:46.760 --> 29:52.040
event to event so we were thinking well we've got this tracking data here and it tells you

29:52.040 --> 29:58.440
about the nature of shots in such detail like maybe you could build a classifier to automate that

29:58.440 --> 30:04.600
labeling process and that was really the the goal of the hackathon was almost kind of a proof of

30:04.600 --> 30:10.920
the concept of like if you just had a lot of data science talent look at that problem over a few

30:10.920 --> 30:19.880
weeks period you know how far could could they take it and um the the prize winning model actually

30:20.600 --> 30:29.560
was able to get 95% accuracy in the the um out of sample testing um so that was that was much more

30:29.560 --> 30:36.680
than than we hoped um and quite quite promising I think for taking that even further with with

30:36.680 --> 30:42.120
more data that we collect over time and um building something that we might actually start using

30:42.680 --> 30:49.800
in events um and I think not only for that particular use is it something that we're interested

30:49.800 --> 30:56.040
in but I think it's a type of model that we could also use to maybe develop other metrics because

30:56.040 --> 31:01.960
if you think about it being able to say how likely is a shot a winner versus an error you can almost

31:01.960 --> 31:07.400
treat that as a measure of the shots difficulty or quality and you could apply that to any shot

31:07.400 --> 31:15.160
happening um in a match and um and so that could be a really interesting sort of extension or

31:15.160 --> 31:20.520
or additional product that could come out of that kind of modeling work so that that was one that

31:20.520 --> 31:25.880
um it's kind of a recent development for the group now that's that's really interesting uh can I

31:25.880 --> 31:32.040
interrupt you and ask how does that 95% compared to what the uh humans that are sitting sitting on

31:32.040 --> 31:38.040
the line recording that data tend to run well that's an interesting question because there's no gold

31:38.040 --> 31:43.560
standard and that's one of the things that is an issue around you know the consistency

31:43.560 --> 31:50.840
because you only have one person at any particular time that's actually doing this in practice um so

31:50.840 --> 31:58.120
I don't think we really know um if there is an error in some sense in how it's being classified

31:58.120 --> 32:03.320
it's difficult to say because it's there's some subjectivity particularly around the distinction

32:03.320 --> 32:09.160
between a force and an unforced error and in fact for that reason you know some some tennis

32:09.160 --> 32:13.800
statisticians just don't really like the system at all because there is this element of subjectivity

32:13.800 --> 32:22.360
because it's like how far do you take it you know um is it a a shot that would be unreturnable

32:22.360 --> 32:29.640
for the average player or do you try to make it specific to that player so that means what

32:29.640 --> 32:35.560
is an unforced error for the hundredth ranked player in the world isn't the same as for Roger

32:35.560 --> 32:42.920
Federer for example um yeah so there's there's this kind of gray area and how these things are

32:42.920 --> 32:49.400
defined so um yeah so we don't really know I think the advantage would be that with having a

32:49.400 --> 32:55.560
system like this you at least would know that the machine is always going to follow the same rules

32:55.560 --> 33:01.640
and that's something that you can't be guaranteed of with with using a human classification

33:01.640 --> 33:07.160
particularly when it's only based on one one person's opinion at any individual match do you

33:07.160 --> 33:13.800
happen to recall any of the details around the winning model and you know it's model type and uh

33:13.800 --> 33:20.920
general structure yeah so the the winning model um the first thing and and this was true actually

33:20.920 --> 33:27.240
what we did was we took the top five based on their um out of sample testing performance and we

33:27.240 --> 33:32.920
asked them all to provide some documentation about their approach and there were some characteristics

33:32.920 --> 33:40.120
that were true across all of the all of the top five and that included um combining the men's and

33:40.120 --> 33:49.000
women's data um in one model and um they all did extensive feature engineering and so

33:49.000 --> 33:56.280
sure the practitioners out there know like how important that can be to improving performance

33:56.280 --> 34:02.600
and and this whole experience really gave me an appreciation for that um and I would say probably

34:02.600 --> 34:09.240
the that was the thing that separated the ultimate top prize winner from the others was the extent

34:09.240 --> 34:13.320
of the feature engineering some of which include basically just trying all kind of possibilities

34:13.320 --> 34:19.480
of combinations among um among the features that were provided but but also giving some thought

34:19.480 --> 34:24.120
to things that would potentially be be relevant so like there were some distances that were

34:24.120 --> 34:30.280
calculated from you know player to player and and things like this so it was kind of a combination

34:30.280 --> 34:38.120
both of sort of um I guess substantively driven uh feature development and then others that were

34:38.120 --> 34:44.200
just more kind of just expanding the future space and other than that I think a lot of the the

34:44.200 --> 34:50.840
top models considered considered boosting types of approaches and those seem to work um particularly

34:50.840 --> 34:56.600
well just on the basis of how much they were represented among that that group of models and a lot

34:56.600 --> 35:05.080
of ensembles in that group of models or no that I think one of the five um did did a more formal

35:05.080 --> 35:11.640
ensemble in the sense that they use multiple ML classifiers and then effectively took a sort of

35:11.640 --> 35:18.280
an average among them um so there there was one but that wasn't actually the top winning the top

35:18.280 --> 35:27.080
winning was um just a pure extreme um boosting approach and do you recall if any were there any

35:27.080 --> 35:32.600
deep learning based uh submissions that tried to forego the feature engineering and just

35:32.600 --> 35:38.360
toss a ton of data to a neural network there were definitely neural networks I don't I don't

35:38.360 --> 35:44.360
think anything would meet like a definition of sort of a deep architecture um which may be

35:44.360 --> 35:50.120
reasonable in the setting because what we provided were sort of summary features about the last two

35:50.120 --> 35:58.040
shots of any individual point um it wasn't like we just gave them you know coordinates in space um so

35:58.040 --> 36:05.320
the data was already fairly handcrafted you could say um um so it wasn't a situation like deep learning

36:05.320 --> 36:12.600
generally been been most successful when applied to image data um and that data you know is much

36:12.600 --> 36:19.080
more complex than what we were providing based off this these kind of summary measures from the

36:19.080 --> 36:26.360
tracking data uh and then on the also on the machine learning front you've been doing some work

36:26.360 --> 36:34.520
on emotion tracking yes so this is this is more of like our image um application so a lot of the

36:34.520 --> 36:41.720
things that we've been discussing have been um focusing on the these tracking data but at the same

36:41.720 --> 36:49.720
time that that's been a very great innovation in the sport we also recognize that we have all of

36:49.720 --> 36:55.480
this match video just sitting around and we're not really doing anything with it from like a

36:55.480 --> 37:01.800
statistical point of view or from a data capture point of view so we've been thinking about well

37:01.800 --> 37:07.800
what are things that we're not able to get from the tracking data that we would want to have to try

37:07.800 --> 37:14.760
to understand the sport better and one of those things is player um emotion and just mentality

37:14.760 --> 37:21.080
in general so in tennis you know there's a lot of conventional wisdom about the importance of a

37:21.080 --> 37:29.160
player's um temperament and and mentality during matches and how they perform but we don't really

37:29.160 --> 37:36.680
have any quantifiable data around those concepts um so it's in some way it's kind of the most elusive

37:36.680 --> 37:42.360
area in tennis performance is really understanding the link between performance and and player

37:42.360 --> 37:52.200
emotion um so we've been working on an approach to try to capture um information about the emotions

37:52.200 --> 38:00.440
expressed during matches using just a single camera video and we actually um have a paper

38:00.440 --> 38:07.240
describing our initial approach that appeared at the MIT Sloan conference this year and uh essentially

38:07.240 --> 38:13.560
we have like seven different emotion types that we um think are relevant are particularly relevant

38:13.560 --> 38:19.480
to a sports context um and this is one of the reasons why the problems of it challenging there's

38:19.480 --> 38:26.120
been a lot of work with facial recognition and expression capture that's that's been um going on

38:26.120 --> 38:34.200
and you can even see you know applications of it in in your social media devices but in in sport

38:34.200 --> 38:41.240
you kind of want to tailor the emotions that you look at because there are some things that are

38:41.240 --> 38:47.080
of more interest in a sports context like how concentrated a player seems to be do they seem

38:47.080 --> 38:53.720
frustrated or nervous these kinds of things um so a lot of our work is actually just constructing

38:53.720 --> 38:59.640
this kind of label data set so we've been treating it like a supervised a learning problem

38:59.640 --> 39:07.080
and so a large part of of the time that we spend is to construct that that database but we have

39:07.080 --> 39:13.400
a an initial version and then we've started to actually apply it and understand understand what

39:13.400 --> 39:21.000
it might suggest about how players react to points and and how their reactions might affect

39:21.000 --> 39:26.360
their future performance and um you know the next kind of frontier for that would be to actually

39:26.360 --> 39:33.480
try to start doing it in real time but that involves a whole nother slew of problems so you have

39:33.480 --> 39:40.280
to be able to in real time um identify player faces from other faces that you might see captured

39:40.280 --> 39:47.640
in the video on broadcast to be able to label the right player to that face and then actually do

39:47.640 --> 39:53.400
any of the prediction on a real time sort of time scale so those are some of the challenges that

39:53.400 --> 39:58.440
we're looking at right now oh sounds like really interesting work it sounds like you're in the

39:58.440 --> 40:03.720
early stages and and starting to build out this data set have you gotten to the point where you've

40:03.720 --> 40:09.240
started building models on top of it and trying to relate that to player performance or are you

40:10.040 --> 40:16.440
still way before that point well we have an initial set of approaches so we looked at a range of

40:16.440 --> 40:23.400
different um you know fairly standard types of machine learning models so we had tree-based

40:23.400 --> 40:32.120
approaches um support factor machines neural nets and from that we were able to um find what

40:32.120 --> 40:38.200
in our initial trainings that was um sort of the best performing approach for each emotion type

40:38.200 --> 40:46.600
of interest and then we applied that to um a group of players that we kind of know what their

40:46.600 --> 40:53.880
baseline should be just based on sort of popular opinion and that was the big four so the big four

40:53.880 --> 41:00.440
are Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, Rafael Nadal, four of the most successful male

41:00.440 --> 41:09.160
tennis players in recent times in fact like from 2006 to the present they've won 45 of 49

41:09.160 --> 41:14.840
grand slams those are the biggest tennis events in the year so so they're they're players that

41:14.840 --> 41:21.640
are quite well known in the sport and so they kind of each have a personality profile and uh

41:22.680 --> 41:29.160
we applied the emotion capture to establish sort of baselines for each of them and it was almost

41:29.160 --> 41:35.480
way checking the face validity of what we were doing because it's like even if our model is able to

41:35.480 --> 41:42.280
get a good level of accuracy against the training sets labels for each of these emotions how do we know

41:42.280 --> 41:47.400
that they actually represent anything meaningful so that was why we wanted to kind of look at a

41:47.400 --> 41:51.560
group of players where we kind of some idea of how they differ in terms of their their typical

41:51.560 --> 41:56.040
temperament um and actually they actually held up quite well because for example it showed that

41:56.040 --> 42:02.840
the predominant emotion for Nadal was anxiety and that was one that you know was was an expectation

42:02.840 --> 42:09.160
for him compared to the other the other three players um whereas Roger Federer was the least

42:09.160 --> 42:14.200
expressive of the group he was if anything he was more focused at any particular point in time

42:14.200 --> 42:21.400
than any of the other emotions so that that was a promising result and then we started to look at

42:21.400 --> 42:27.160
for that group what the relationship was with uh performance and we did find that there were

42:28.600 --> 42:34.600
there were strong associations with the number of the emotions that were captured and how that

42:34.600 --> 42:41.640
player was performing in in the matches that were we evaluated which does suggest that there

42:41.640 --> 42:46.360
is some link there but the interesting thing is that it was quite variable like the nature of those

42:46.360 --> 42:53.320
associations uh from one player to the next so what that it's still early days

42:54.040 --> 42:59.400
incoming any very strong conclusions but I think right now we can say that um there

43:00.280 --> 43:06.200
if there is a link it's probably one that's player specific the nature of how emotions

43:07.080 --> 43:13.640
influence the player's performance yeah I would think that if the you know you've got four

43:13.640 --> 43:21.880
very winning players that all have different baseline temperaments then the uh it would be the

43:21.880 --> 43:26.440
difference between their baseline and what they're observed at in any particular point of time

43:26.440 --> 43:33.640
that would be kind of a ventrist um as opposed to you know the frustrated player never wins or

43:33.640 --> 43:38.600
something like that if there's a really good frustrated player yeah that's definitely one of the

43:38.600 --> 43:45.480
things that were interested in in um evaluating more broadly as we collect more amorphous

43:45.480 --> 43:53.720
emotion data um is is it you know just the absolute intensity of any particular emotion or is it

43:53.720 --> 44:00.600
you know how um how much it represents a change um from what's normal for a particular

44:00.600 --> 44:06.360
player that that actually matters um and if you just look at you know the top of the game

44:06.360 --> 44:11.640
um and it's been true historically like you go back to board macro and you couldn't find like

44:11.640 --> 44:16.200
two more opposite personalities but in terms of their success you know they were quite quite

44:16.200 --> 44:22.600
comparable and and that's that's true as well today you can have players that express a lot of

44:22.600 --> 44:29.640
anger and intensity like an Andy Murray you know against um a sort of stoic champion like

44:29.640 --> 44:36.520
Federer and so that in itself tells you that it's probably not that there's any like universal mentality

44:36.520 --> 44:42.600
that's like the one formula for being um you know one of the all-time best players in the sport

44:43.320 --> 44:49.560
but it may have more to do with these kind of deviations from whatever a player's kind of norm is

44:49.560 --> 44:55.000
right right wow super super interesting work thank you so much for taking the time out to share

44:55.000 --> 44:59.960
it with us yeah thank you for the opportunity Sam this is fun is there anything else that you'd

44:59.960 --> 45:06.360
like to know for the audience or anything that you'd like to point them to um I guess just to say

45:06.360 --> 45:11.800
I mean it for the maybe aspiring sport statisticians think there's definitely a lot of opportunity

45:11.800 --> 45:17.320
these days I know our own groups been been growing even over the past six months and and I think

45:17.320 --> 45:25.240
there's more and more appreciation for how data science expertise can help to advance sport in

45:25.240 --> 45:30.200
all areas I didn't even mention but I mean there's more more work being done on the business side

45:30.200 --> 45:35.640
for example and understanding you know consumer behavior it's bored and ticketing and things

45:35.640 --> 45:42.840
like that so so there's definitely more and more opportunity um for a statisticians data scientists

45:42.840 --> 45:47.400
that are interested in careers in sport and so I would definitely encourage you all to pursue it

45:47.400 --> 45:56.920
