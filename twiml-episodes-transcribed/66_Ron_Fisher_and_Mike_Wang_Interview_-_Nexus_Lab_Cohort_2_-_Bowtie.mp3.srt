00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,920
Hello and welcome to another episode of Twimble Talk, the podcast where I interview interesting

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,880
people, doing interesting things in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,200
I'm your host Sam Charrington.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,440
I'd like to start off this show by sending out a huge thank you to everyone listening.

5
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,800
We've dropped a ton of great interviews over the past few weeks and through your dedication

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,040
we continue to see a growing outpouring of feedback comments and shares with each release.

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,600
If you're a regular listener but don't normally send in feedback, we'd really love to hear

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,600
from you.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,520
So please head on over to Apple Podcasts or wherever you listen and leave us a review.

10
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,760
A 5 star review is of course appreciated but what's most important is that your voice

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,960
is heard.

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,480
And let's us know what you like or what you feel we can improve on and it also lets

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,440
those looking for a new machine learning and AI podcast know that they should join the

14
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,120
Twimble community.

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,000
Speaking of community, the details of our next Twimble online meetup have been posted.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:22,440
On Tuesday, November 14th at 3pm Pacific time, we'll be joined by Kevin T who will be presenting

17
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:28,120
his paper, active preference learning for personalized portfolio construction.

18
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,000
If you've already registered for the meetup, you should have received an invitation

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,960
with all the details.

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,840
If you still need to register, head on over to twimbleai.com slash meetup to do so.

21
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,480
We hope to see you there.

22
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,800
Now as some of you may know, we spent a few days last week in New York City hosted by

23
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,120
our great friends at NYU Future Labs.

24
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,880
About six months ago, we covered their inaugural AI Summit, an event they hosted to showcase

25
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,920
the startups in the first batch of their AI Nexus Lab program, as well as the impressive

26
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,040
AI talent in the New York City ecosystem.

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,120
While we were more than excited when we found out they would be having a second summit

28
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,360
so soon, this time, we had the pleasure of interviewing the four startups of the second

29
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,480
AI Nexus Lab batch.

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:23,800
We also interviewed a bunch of the speakers from the event and will be sharing those discussions

31
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,920
over the upcoming weeks.

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,320
In this show, I speak with Ron Fisher and Mike Wang, who, along with Vivek Siddarsen, founded

33
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,640
Bowtie Labs, a 24-7 AI-based receptionist designed to help businesses and the beauty

34
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,280
wellness and fitness industries increase retail conversion rates.

35
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,040
I've talked with a few startups in the conversational space recently, and one common theme seems

36
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,200
to be quickly outgrowing commercial conversational platforms.

37
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,640
Ron and Mike shared their own experiences with this decision, and shared some of the challenges

38
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,640
they're trying to overcome with their own ML models, as well as some of the techniques

39
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,640
they use to make their system as robust and responsive as possible.

40
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:18,560
All right, everyone, I am at NYU Future Labs, and I am with the co-founders of Bowtie,

41
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,440
Ron Fisher and Mike Wang, Ron, and Mike, welcome to this weekend Machine Learning and AI.

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,440
Thank you very much.

43
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,440
Thank you.

44
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,520
So, why don't we get started with having you, Ron, tell us a little bit about your background

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,680
and how you got to get involved in Bowtie?

46
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:35,560
Sure, it's definitely been a long and winding road.

47
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,320
After college, I served in the Israeli Army for three years, basically, and did the digital

48
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,720
strategy there and helped build out the new media, so that was definitely in my beginnings

49
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,360
in terms of working with technology, and after that, I worked at Nielsen for five years,

50
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,640
and then finally got my MBA Cornell Tech, where I met Mike, and my co-founder also came

51
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,680
from Nielsen, so we had already known each other, and then the three of us formed this team

52
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,640
as part of our final semester, where we are tasked with basically working on any problem

53
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:08,280
we want, and if we want to continue that work after Spinat as a real company.

54
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
Oh, wow.

55
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,160
How about you, Mike?

56
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,080
So I graduated from Cornell Undergrad, where I studied computer science, and that's

57
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,280
why I really found my interest in sort of machine learning and AI in that field.

58
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,760
And following that, I actually went directly to Cornell Tech for grad school, and that's

59
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,800
where I met these guys, and we formed the team, and I think we have a really balanced

60
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,880
skillset, and it's been an amazing journey so far with them.

61
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,880
Nice.

62
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,880
Awesome.

63
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,560
So Bo-Tai, what does Bo-Tai do besides having an awesome robot logo sticker?

64
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,560
So, yes.

65
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,720
Actually, that robot has been retired.

66
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Oh, right.

67
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
Yeah.

68
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,720
Things change very quickly in a startup.

69
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
It's a 24-7 AI receptionist.

70
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,720
Okay.

71
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,320
It's currently focused on beauty, wellness, and fitness businesses, so anything from like

72
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,400
a high-end beauty salon to like a chain of gyms, yoga studios, things like that, and

73
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,960
it operates on the web and through texting, and if you call any of the businesses and nobody

74
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,760
answers, then the AI receptionist will instantly text you back, so it can convert people before

75
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,760
they have a chance to move on to another business.

76
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,760
Okay.

77
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,760
So, how does that work?

78
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:18,560
So, let's say like Morgan finds a cool salon on Yelp.

79
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
She calls it up.

80
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Nobody answers.

81
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
She's frustrated.

82
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,560
She wants to blow up.

83
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,400
She will now call on other business.

84
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,400
She calls us a lot.

85
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400
Nobody answers.

86
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,840
And then our AI receptionist, text her instantly, says, hey, you know, it's Lily from Bo-Tai

87
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,840
salon.

88
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,840
How can I help you?

89
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:35,840
And then Morgan was like, oh, she just sex back.

90
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,520
I'd love a blow out today through PM, and then they go back and forth by messaging to

91
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,840
input the appointment.

92
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,600
What percentage of the inbound calls are coming from mobile nowadays?

93
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,000
Do you get a pretty high hit rate on that?

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah.

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,600
I would say almost all the inbound calls are coming from mobile.

96
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:57,520
So I don't have an exact number, but we're able to text back with vast majority of users.

97
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,120
Sometimes we see like someone calling for a landline, but that's actually in the low

98
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
minority.

99
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Interesting.

100
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,120
Interesting.

101
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,240
So, I've been familiar with some kind of these appointments, casual and kind of apps.

102
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,120
And then you have like your ex.ai, Amy kind of thing, and you guys are bringing that

103
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
together.

104
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,520
Is that a good way to think about this?

105
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,520
Yeah.

106
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,960
So, we're kind of like business to business to consumer.

107
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,560
In a sense, we're giving them a tool set that they could deploy to their customer base.

108
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,560
Okay.

109
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
Interesting.

110
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,560
And so, how does it all work?

111
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Yeah.

112
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
So, great question.

113
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,520
Well, all the texting we use Twilio for, you know, the SMS stuff.

114
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,080
We also do a web chat, which we have our own little plugin that sits on their website.

115
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,760
So, that's typically where customers first find out about us, or, you know, contact

116
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
the bot.

117
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:50,520
And what happens to Facebook Messenger, or is it a standalone bot on the page?

118
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,520
Yeah.

119
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,040
So, we do have Facebook Messenger as a third channel.

120
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,600
So, we have a web chat, which typically sits on their website.

121
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,600
You can think of like Intercom or like, as an example, what that might look like.

122
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,080
And then SMS is where we reach out to customers who call and nobody answers.

123
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,800
And so, those are sort of three channels that we're working in right now.

124
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,600
And so, what happens is that when a customer sends us a message, we do two things.

125
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,880
We extract the intent of the customer.

126
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,440
So, like, what are they looking to do?

127
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,480
You know, some people are looking to book an appointment right away.

128
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,840
Other people are just looking for prices, or, you know, what time are you guys open?

129
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,520
And so, we class by their intent.

130
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,840
And then, we extract the entities, relevant entities in the message to figure out like,

131
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,360
okay, who are they trying to book with?

132
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,360
What are they trying to book?

133
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,840
What time do they want to come in?

134
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,640
And then, if there's anything missing, then we follow up and say, like, hey, you know,

135
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,040
I got that you want a haircut.

136
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,840
Did you want a men's cutter or women's cut?

137
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,400
And who do you want it with, and when do you want to come in, and so forth?

138
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,720
Interesting.

139
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,760
How did you select the particular vertical that you're going after, or at least starting

140
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,760
with?

141
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,400
So, originally, we wanted to do, we were very passionate about chatbots, so we were talking

142
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,520
about predictive assistance.

143
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,320
And we knew that there were a lot of companies attacking the enterprise side of the problem.

144
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:08,080
And we said that it would be really cool to do some sort of, like, self-service platform

145
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,480
to be able to provide this, like, to businesses and mass.

146
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,560
Similar to what Mailchip does with email.

147
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,040
And this was before Facebook opened up the platform for Messenger, and, like, before

148
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,360
it kind of, like, superheated up while we were still in school.

149
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,240
So we actually originally were like, okay, well, what is a business that people interact

150
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
with every day?

151
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,240
Right.

152
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,720
And we're like, well, what do people do every day to eat?

153
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,440
So we started in food, because none of us have any experience really in, like, beauty

154
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,960
on a sore fitness.

155
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,120
And then, eventually, once we launched across, like, 25 restaurants in New York, we saw

156
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,080
that we felt like we weren't really solving a problem.

157
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,440
And while it was, like, iteratively better, it wasn't, like, 10 times better.

158
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,840
And in that sense, we were kind of fighting an uphill battle.

159
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,680
So during our time in an accelerator already after school, we said, we believe in the underlying

160
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,720
thesis of Bowtie, which is that, like, apps are becoming increasingly irrelevant, like,

161
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,840
65% of users down the zero new apps a month.

162
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,800
And that all these types of businesses, like, local businesses and things like that, are

163
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,760
still pumping money into apps that nobody really wants.

164
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,720
So then we spoke to a bunch of different people, did research.

165
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,200
And then basically, like, after a few conversations, one of which was with, like, a beauty expert

166
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,440
in our accelerator, CEO of Theave at the time, a lot of Gregory, we said, you know, we're

167
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,280
considering the beauty space.

168
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,880
And then she's like, yeah, you know, I don't know.

169
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
Like, let me think about it.

170
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,320
And then two days later, she's like, no, she's like, this is a real issue for the sector.

171
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,880
And then after doing our own research, we found a variety of reasons why it really made

172
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,560
sense to actually dive in and apply the technology to them.

173
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Okay.

174
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,680
And what kind of response have you received?

175
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:45,800
And generally, these kind of, you know, mom and pop shops for lack of a better term,

176
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:51,240
like, they're, they are historically really difficult to gain traction in for startups.

177
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,480
What are you doing to try to overcome that?

178
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,480
So we basically have like a variety of techniques that we employ, whether that's like, drip emails

179
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,000
or like, cold calling to trade shows.

180
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,960
And what we found was it definitely, like, the trade shows is the most effective.

181
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,840
And it kind of draws the people who are looking for new technology to begin with.

182
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,200
And I think that that's been really helpful for us.

183
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,320
And they're also really happy because we're the only ones who are providing this type of

184
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,400
solution.

185
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,920
And it's a problem that they're very aware of that they have.

186
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,080
So that being able to kind of like deliver on something that they know is an issue has

187
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,720
been very helpful for us.

188
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,720
Okay.

189
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,440
One of the benefits about working with these types of businesses is that they pay attention

190
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:32,200
to numbers and, you know, real improvement in their business.

191
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,280
So if you can prove that, say, where we can handle, you know, X percent of their call

192
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:42,800
volume or get them X dollars in incremental revenue, like that really resonates with

193
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
them.

194
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,400
Because at the end of the day, like, you know, even a small amount of incremental revenue

195
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,760
can make a huge difference for these smaller shops.

196
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,080
And so in contrasting that with like consumer behavior where it's a lot more sort of up in

197
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,240
the air, like, you know, this is fun to use, like, there's so many other alternatives.

198
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,040
But for us, it's like if we can really show them that it's going to materially improve

199
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,680
their business, then that really resonates with them.

200
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:13,920
So what are some of the biggest challenges you face from machine learning and AI perspective

201
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,920
and pulling this all together?

202
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,920
Yeah.

203
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,680
So I would say, as you can imagine, the biggest challenge for us is that we started off

204
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,080
with zero data.

205
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:26,840
And so we really had to bootstrap the automation with like proprietary algorithms, just doing

206
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,920
lots and lots of research into like, what do people say, how do people say it, and sort

207
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:37,200
of slowly collect enough data that we could start training a model and start to generalize

208
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,200
a little bit.

209
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,760
But as you, when you start doing this type of thing, you quickly realize that like people

210
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,840
say things in a million different ways, like, how many ways can you ask for a haircut,

211
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,840
right?

212
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,920
You'd really be surprised when you ask for a haircut.

213
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:55,040
And there's also so many other requests that like we never would have thought of that someone

214
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,800
might even text, like, do you guys offer organic products?

215
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,440
When we set out to build a system that could help people book appointments and reschedule

216
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,480
and ask for prices or whatever, there's a lot of things that we never even considered

217
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,600
where like requests that would be coming in.

218
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,120
And that is what makes the customer service space difficult in general if you're trying

219
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,080
to automate it, just like the breadth of requests that come in.

220
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,720
But that's one of the reasons why we chose to start off in such a narrow vertical is that

221
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,760
it makes it vastly easier to handle those requests.

222
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:36,720
Whereas if we wanted to, you know, there's a lot of companies out there like ASAP and digital

223
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,120
genius who are trying to sort of augment or automate call centers and very generalized

224
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,640
customer service.

225
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,760
And that is a very, very difficult problem.

226
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,080
So we're trying to be a little bit more narrow.

227
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:55,000
And so have you developed any particular kinds of tools or approaches for kind of starting

228
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,880
in a whittle down that long tail of requests or well, how do you handle that?

229
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Yeah.

230
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:08,400
So the majority of requests that do come in are things that, you know, we've sort of collected

231
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:14,040
over the past six months and to be honest, it's a very manual process of like figuring

232
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:17,720
out what a new request might be.

233
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,160
And you know, there's, you can get 80%, you know, classic 80, 20 will here, like you

234
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:29,520
can get 80% of those requests with like 20% of the work.

235
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,680
And the other one, you know, like 20% of their requests might be sort of smaller or random

236
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,680
things.

237
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,320
And what we do is whenever there's something that we don't understand, we like mark that

238
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,640
in our system.

239
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,720
And then, you know, every once in a while we go through that list and pull out trends

240
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,600
that we're seeing, like initially we didn't realize that so many people would get to the

241
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,400
end of a booking process and ask for the price, but we found that looking at our data and

242
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,840
going back and saying like, okay, this is something that we now have to handle.

243
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:01,000
And there's also a lot of requests that are like served specific to a business.

244
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,520
So someone might be like, where do I park?

245
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,520
And that sort of thing.

246
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,680
So that's another aspect that makes this difficult.

247
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,840
But what we've done there is like created basically a custom FAQ system where a business

248
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,240
can go and enter in their own questions and answers.

249
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,600
And we use a mix of our own tools, along with Microsoft's Q&A service, to handle those

250
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,520
like sort of more one-off questions and answers.

251
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,680
Okay.

252
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:33,120
It sounds like you're not doing any human and loo type of aspect to this where if a request

253
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,320
comes in and it's not understood, it's kind of escalated to some agents that you or the

254
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,400
customer is managing.

255
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,760
Oh, so we actually do do that.

256
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,720
If something doesn't understand something, then we pass it off to a human.

257
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,440
And that's typically, you know, the business is existing customer support staff.

258
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,280
So that might be receptionist or even a call center.

259
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,920
And so we, anything we don't understand, it gets passed off to a human.

260
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,160
But in terms of marking it in our system as something that we might want to handle in

261
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,120
the future, that process is sort of difficult to automate.

262
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,240
And that's something that we're working on.

263
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,360
And we even have sort of a dashboard that the business operators work in.

264
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,880
And we're planning on adding tools in there that would actually allow the operator to go

265
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,920
highlight a sentence and say like, this is something that the bot didn't get, but is

266
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,840
a common request that we get.

267
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:26,760
And then they could either add that to their FAQ automatically or sort of like you said,

268
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,160
escalate that to us and we would go work on it.

269
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:36,720
And is it your sense that something like that would be readily adopted by, I'm imagining

270
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,720
us a lot on ours.

271
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:42,000
And I'm assuming you're going after not kind of these big chains alarms, but like smaller

272
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,560
shops, like, are they going to want to even think about that?

273
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,320
Well, we're going for both.

274
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,080
So there are, that we do have some bigger clients that are nationwide and they're easier

275
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
to work with.

276
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,080
But then they have their own like technology issues.

277
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,680
So they have like systems that we want, they want us to integrate with.

278
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,800
But in terms of the smaller businesses, as long as you give them something on a mobile

279
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,640
device, I actually do feel like they're pretty open to it.

280
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,240
But they also have like a very low tolerance for error because of the fact that they're

281
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
in the service business.

282
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,720
So like you really have to nail it the first time.

283
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,800
Interesting.

284
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:17,960
On the conversational side, did you start off on one of the commercial conversational platforms

285
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:23,280
or did you roll your own, I'm thinking here of things like API.ai and other things?

286
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,280
Yeah.

287
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:28,760
So we actually, you know, we tried all those platforms out when we set out to do this initially

288
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,640
and found that it was just too much of a black box.

289
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:38,120
So when you, you know, we have real clients using this product, then it really can't mess

290
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,640
up on things that are like easily remedied if we had our own more customizable model and

291
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
system.

292
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:50,160
Well, it's an example of something that you found it messed up a lot on that given your

293
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,480
own platform was easily remediedable.

294
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,480
Yeah, definitely.

295
00:16:53,480 --> 00:17:00,280
So, for example, Solon Service is called Single Process and I had no idea that existed

296
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:05,200
before entering the space, but if you, to me, I'm thinking versus multi-threaded, but

297
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,600
that's probably the same thing, right?

298
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,400
So Single Process is like two pretty common words together.

299
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,760
And if you just say, if you just piped in a sentence to an out-of-the-box model that's

300
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,680
said like, can I come in for a single process next Friday?

301
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,360
It wouldn't recognize that as an entity, right?

302
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,680
Because it'd be the process as the entity in single is like exactly.

303
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:31,080
It's like a quantity, it might pick it up as a quantity, process is like, is that even

304
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,080
like a service?

305
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,760
Or is it, process is also a pretty general term, right?

306
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:40,080
So what we found is that we really had to augment and customize the system to be able

307
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,160
to work with even the most simple things in real production.

308
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,360
And that's actually very doable because we have, you know, a list of all the services

309
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,480
that the businesses have.

310
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,360
And over time, we've sort of automated the process of creating aliases in different alternative

311
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,360
ways.

312
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,080
People ask for things.

313
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,200
And those are things that you just can't input into a black box model that you might find

314
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,320
with like with that AI.

315
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,760
And so what we found is that those things are good for like, you know, sort of a small

316
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:17,240
talk kind of bought or, or maybe something a little bit more geared towards one-off responses

317
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:23,400
like a Q&A type of thing, but in terms of having a full conversation and holding state

318
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:32,080
and entities in the context of a very particular business and meeting very high accuracy to

319
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,240
input the exact appointment that the user is asking for, that required a lot more customization.

320
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,240
Okay.

321
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,320
And so what, tell me a little bit about the effort involved in building out that platform

322
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,280
and what were some of the difficult decisions that you had to make and which way you ended

323
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,280
up going on those?

324
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,800
Yeah, definitely.

325
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:55,720
So one of the big challenges was integrating into the businesses in the first place.

326
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Okay.

327
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,600
So we work with mind-body businesses.

328
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,160
Mind-body is a scheduling platform that has, you know, fitness, beauty, wellness businesses.

329
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,440
And we use our API to sort of pull in the business information when they onboard.

330
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,440
So their staff members, their services, their availability and so forth.

331
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,520
And what we've found is that every single, not every single business, but many of the businesses

332
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,600
on this platform have their menu structured or written out in a different way.

333
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,920
They're like super messy, right?

334
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:33,000
Because when they're writing it out, all they need for it to do is for the receptionist

335
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,760
to be able to like click a drop-down and then find the service that the user is asking

336
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,280
for on the phone and then put it into the appointment.

337
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,800
But when we are trying to automate that process, we have to be able to capture, however

338
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:51,200
customer asks for it, we have to drill down to what specific service they're asking for.

339
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,320
So if they say laser hair removal, we need to be able to figure out if they're looking

340
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,040
for laser hair removal on their chin or on their forearm because those are all the specific

341
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,520
services in the system.

342
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,600
And so just importing and integrating into many businesses and sort of generalizing that

343
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:15,160
process on top of automated conversations has been a real challenge because it doesn't

344
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,120
come in as clean structure data where it's like service 1, you know, name plus 10 ways

345
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
of asking for it.

346
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,760
Service 2, name plus 10 ways of asking for it.

347
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:30,280
And so when we think about doing this at scale, we not only have to develop sort of models

348
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:36,600
for talking to the user back and forth, but also importing businesses, menu data and

349
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,200
structuring it and cleaning it up and not having to do that all manually.

350
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,200
Okay.

351
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:49,920
Do your customers ever ask you about wanting to have input into kind of the personality

352
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:55,200
if you will of their bots, like whether they're formal or informal or, you know, use a

353
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,200
Southern draw in the text or something like that, like, is that something that comes

354
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
up?

355
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,200
Yeah.

356
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,640
So we've had some really weird requests, like one person wanted their AI to be like an

357
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,640
AI dog.

358
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,560
So they wanted a bunch of dog references throughout the model and other times, if it's like

359
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,800
a larger brand, if there's one that's like as a global presence, they were very like

360
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,280
formal and they really wanted it to be like very fancy in their language.

361
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,880
So there's definitely always a back and forth between me saying that's fine and then Mike

362
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:28,320
telling me that I could take like another 10 hours.

363
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,320
So yes.

364
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,960
How do those kind of requests impact the system that you've built?

365
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,960
Yeah.

366
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,440
So the good thing is that a lot of those personality tweaks are just changes in copy in terms of

367
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,320
the messages that we sent out right.

368
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:48,640
So what we've done is just created a bunch of different places in the conversation where

369
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,480
the business can then go and tweak the message.

370
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,000
So around really core stuff, like, this is your booking, does it look right?

371
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,520
You know, we don't want them to be able to tweak every single word, but what we do is

372
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,320
like in the confirmation message text that the user gets when they've completed a booking,

373
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,000
we might have a section at the bottom where the business can add anything they want there.

374
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,480
So if they have a cancellation policy that they need to highlight or if they have like

375
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,840
special sort of something that they need to tell the user, like to not, you know, go

376
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,680
sun 10 two weeks before the deployment or whatever, then they would put that there.

377
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,080
So we have like a bunch of slots that they can modify.

378
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:34,200
Interesting. And then in terms of the kind of the MLAI tech, you know, having built up

379
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:41,000
this platform from scratch, what are some of the, you know, toolkits and languages and

380
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
like, what does the stack look like for you guys?

381
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Yeah, definitely.

382
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,080
So we do everything in Python and in my opinion, the best language or data science, one

383
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,240
of the best languages in general.

384
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,880
But so we use Eski learned for a lot of the sort of out of the box models that we then

385
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:04,600
go and, you know, for any model really, most of the work goes into the feature engineering,

386
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,880
feature selection and data cleaning, all that stuff that goes into it before actually,

387
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,200
you know, doing the math and the regression or the classification behind it.

388
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:20,440
And so Eski learned, we use pretty extensively, NLTK is a great natural language processing

389
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,680
library that comes right bundled with Python.

390
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,160
We use that for a lot of, you know, like part of speech tagging, that type of thing.

391
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:34,160
And then we use spacey.io, which is another NLP library that can do like syntax, parsing

392
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,440
at very high speeds compared to other more state of the art models that are a lot slower

393
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,360
in terms of like real time parsing.

394
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,200
And yeah, we're experimenting right now with TensorFlow and sort of the more, some of the

395
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,280
deep learnings that would like work vectors and potentially looking into LSTMs for the

396
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,000
energy recognition stuff.

397
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,880
But at this point, the data that we have isn't quite at the volume that you would need

398
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,040
to do to do word vectors successfully.

399
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,240
And we're still experimenting with that.

400
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,240
Okay.

401
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,240
Awesome.

402
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Awesome.

403
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
What's next?

404
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,600
What are some of the big things you're looking forward to on, you know, either the business

405
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,440
or tech side or big challenges that you're looking to overcome?

406
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:22,360
So now, I think it's just about being able to like shrink down the testing phase for each

407
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,680
of the clients that we work with because of what I was saying with their little tolerance

408
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,680
for error.

409
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:31,120
So we have like a huge influx of interest because they're very excited about the whole idea.

410
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,200
And then they're expecting to work 110% of the time.

411
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,360
So just being able to make sure that we can basically give it to them and for it to launch

412
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:44,480
and for them to be able to basically all have zero errors from the beginning, like ironing

413
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,720
out that process because now we're really like scaling out the platform, I think that's

414
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,880
the main issue for it, for me at least, in terms of what's next.

415
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,880
Anything to add, Mike?

416
00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:00,600
Yeah, I would say I think basically scaling the onboarding process like Ron sort of getting

417
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
at it.

418
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,680
And then also thinking about, you know, this may be a little bit far off, but you know,

419
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,920
it's something that we started thinking about as like expanding into other verticals.

420
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:13,560
And so how do we sort of transfer the models and the knowledge that we have from this particular

421
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,520
vertical and make it more generalizable and make, you know, if we get into real estate

422
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:23,880
that we won't have to bootstrap the automated conversations there like we did for this.

423
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:30,760
And so in that vein, there's going to be a lot of sort of how do we separate out the

424
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:37,960
beauty specific aspects of the model and maybe try to extract the appointment booking aspects

425
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,480
and sort of try to generalize everything.

426
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,680
So that's something not about thinking about a lot.

427
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:46,080
Awesome. Ron and Mike, thanks so much for taking the time to chat with us.
